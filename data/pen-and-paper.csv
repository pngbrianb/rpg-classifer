rpg,t3_a7o2gd,"What do you think of Gary Gygax's take on Tolkien?Coincidentally, I stumbled on the following article from Dragon magazine: [The influence of J. R. R. Tolkien on the D&amp;D and AD&amp;D games](https://archive.org/stream/DragonMagazine260_201801/DragonMagazine095#page/n13/mode/2up)

In there Gygax explains not only the influence of Tolkien's fiction on D&amp;D (which is minimal), but also goes on about his opinion of Tolkien's fiction in general. And it turns out Gygax did not think very highly of it.

For example, he says: 

&gt; I found the ""Ring Trilogy"" . . .  well, tedious. The action dragged, and it  smacked of an allegory of the struggle of the little common working folk of England  against the threat of Hitler's Nazi evil. At the risk of incurring the wrath of the Professor's dedicated readers, I must say that I  was so bored with his tomes that I took  nearly three weeks to finish them.

And then later on:

&gt; Gandalf is quite ineffectual, plying a sword at times and casting spells which are quite low-powered (in terms of the D&amp;D game). Obviously, neither he nor his magic had any influence on the games. The wicked Sauron is poorly developed, virtually depersonalized,  and at the end blows away in a cloud of evil  smoke . . . poof! Nothing usable there. 

It seems clear to me that the main purpose of the article was to dispel certain myths regarding the connection between TLotR and D&amp;D -- and for that reason, Gygax may have been unnecessarily harsh on Tolkien. 

Still I find it a bit funny that he'd go as far as to call it ""boring"" and ""undeveloped."" I'm by no means a fan of Tolkien's writing (especially the quality of this prose), but I can't imagine it could be seen as ""worse"" than the pulps Gygax was reading at the time (and I love the pulps, but some of their writing was just ghastly). 

Gygax also seemed to imply that the Tolkien's fantasy is not suitable for a D&amp;D style game.... 

What do you think? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a7o2gd/what_do_you_think_of_gary_gygaxs_take_on_tolkien/,"[""I think that for forty years, people have been complaining that D&amp;D doesn't let them create their own LotR style epics, in spite of the fact that elves, dwarves, hobbits, and orcs feature so prominently in the game.\n\nBecause nobody listened back in the 70s when Gygax said that his game was about Conan and John Carter and Elric style adventures, not epic fantasy.\n\nNow _The Hobbit_, on the other hand, being a story entirely about a heist of dragon gold, is just about the perfect sort of D&amp;D adventure…"", ""I mean, he's not wrong, some people just like epic conflicts that have long periods of travel and detailed descriptions of preparing for battle between the actual action, where a wizard's true power is knowing where to be and who to gather as allies, and the triumph over evil is more a matter of overcoming your own darkness and temptation than about hacking into the Evil Overlord with sufficient skill and force. And that's not what he wanted his game to be about, so it's not. (It's worth mentioning, though, that Tolkien denied his works were ever topical or allegorical)\n\nI actually find the last part of the interview more interesting, where he says he took names and aesthetics from Middle-earth specifically to get in on the Tolkien craze, hoping that by the time players realized it was more Conan than Lord of the Rings, they'd already be enjoying the game."", ""It sounds to me like Gygax cared about characters, and abilities, but not worlds.\n\nI actually agree with him about Sauron, but I think he's so wrong about Gandalf that I challenge his reading comprehension. The whole point of Gandalf is that he's holding his power back to not have undue influence.\n\nIf you want character driven fiction, it's fair to call LotR boring, as its more the world that makes it interesting than any characters.\n\nBut to call it undeveloped? I think Gygax is telling us more about himself than anything else."", ""Gary said a great many things, more than a few of them were nonsense. \n\nIt's worth noting that TSR received a cease and desist for their use of copyrighted material in early printings of OD&amp;D. Which likely contributed to Gygax's decision to downplay the influence of Tolkien's work on the game. \n\nIt's quite clear that the Lord of the Rings had a profound influence on D&amp;D. As to his opinions on the works, I see no reason not to believe Gary when he claimed he found Tolkien's novels boring. From the other influences he cites it's pretty clear that Gary preferred a more action oriented American pulp style."", 'Gygax was a gamer. He understood that most people don\'t care about the history of the longsword they\'re reforging, they just care that it goes ""schwing!"" and can cut through steel and how awesome that is. He built D&amp;D to be fun. D&amp;D isn\'t meant to be the Poetic Edda, it\'s meant to be The Tower Of The Elephant.\n\nThat said, there are players who like that stuff. That\'s okay, the game is pretty flexible and can handle that kind of thing (although usually everybody puts the dice down while you\'re doing it). I imagine Gygax probably wouldn\'t have liked narrative RPG systems like FATE or Fiasco.', 'Of course there\'s no influence of Tolkien on D&amp;D. That\'s why he wrote it with Elves, Dwarves (the normal English spelling was ""elfs"" and ""dwarfs"" until Tolkien), Half-Elves (little precedent outside of LoTR), and among the many things that appear nowhere else: Orcs, Balrogs (on the freaking *cover* of AD&amp;D), and Hobbits. Literally ""hobbits"" until Tolkien\'s estate sued and he had to change it to ""halflings"". \n\nNo influence, my ass. Gygax was just covering his butt. ', ""I don't buy it, but I also find most of Tolkien's work to be a bit of a drag. "", 'Gygax was, whatever his virtues, not to be trusted when discussing them.  He was a furious self promoter and this is an example of that.\n\nD&amp;D has other influences, but Tolkien is its biggest one no matter what post facto justifications Gygax wanted to make. None of this means your or my D&amp;D need be Tolkien padtiche, or if it is that it needs to ignore the same bits of Lord of the Rings that Gygax did.', 'Terry Pratchett said that Tolkien in fantasy is like Mt. Fuji in Japanese art. Sometimes it is large and in the foreground. Sometimes, it is small and in the background. And sometimes, you can’t see it at all because the artist is standing on Mt. Fuji. \n\nWhen Gygax claims the Tolkien influences were minimal, that’s what I think. ', 'It\'s the sort of missing the point when one is aiming at a completely different target.\n\n""I am criticizing this thing that is thoroughly opposed to the things I want for not doing the things I want! Why doesn\'t this blender do my taxes for me?""\n\nWhich is strange, because *The Hobbit* is up there with Fafhrd, Mouser, and Conan in terms of D&amp;Disms.\n\nAdventuring party check. Adventure to steal treasure from dragon in ancient ruins, check. Random encounters on the road, check. Magic loot, check. Killing the dragon and finding the treasure has consequences, check.\n\nBut then again, Gygax was both a showman and something of a bottomless well of batty opinions (see: the relationship between lawful good characters and orc children) so I generally just shrug them off when they come up. ', ""He has a (very common) misunderstanding about allegory and applicability.\n\nAllegory is the author's intent in writing something to symbolically stand in for something else. Applicability is when the reader can have something stand in for something else. These two things are not mutually exclusive, but I think to the point *against* Gygax's reading of the LotR trilogy, the lion's share of inspiration for it didn't come from Tolkein's experiences with WW2, but with WW1.\n\nNOW there's a whole other thing with *coding* which is another can of worms all-together, and I suggest some viewing of this good [Lindsey Ellis video essay on 'Bright'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLOxQxMnEz8) in lieu of me stealing from that video any further.\n\nBut again, to be fair to Gygax, people commonly interchange and conflate allegory, applicability, and coding."", ""/u/throneofsalt /u/dungeonofsigns Couldn't there also be a difference between what influenced the *conception and creation* of D&amp;D and what was written in AD&amp;D?\n\nClearly, the elves, dwarves, halflings, giant eagles, werebear, orc etc were there to appeal to those who read Tolkien. And AD&amp;D certainly leans more toward that. But several most notable elements are root, again, in more S&amp;S. The Hand &amp; Eye of Venca has to be a straight rip from Moorcock's *The Knight of Swords*.\n\nI also think another important aspect of understanding D&amp;D is looking at the early adventures/modules separately from the rulebooks (also there is a lot of advice in modules that I think gives a clearer picture of how those authors conceived of D&amp;D).\n\nEarlier D&amp;D, to me, certainly feels way more influenced by the pulp swords &amp; sorcery. So more Moorcock, Howard, Vance, Leiber, and Lovecraft. *B4 The Lost City* feels more Lovecraft/Howard than Tolkien. *B1 Isle of Dread* is also more Jules Vern than Tolkien. *Expedition to Barrier Peaks* has a strong John Carter of Mars feel too with the mix of fantasy and sci-fi.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"", ""I think people have different likes and dislikes. I love Tolkien's world, that Gygax did not, means nothing to me. It doesn't change my view point on Tolkien or Gygax."", ""Gygax had to say those things about LotR because he was just involved in a lawsuit with the Tolkien estate. But the fact remains that much of Chainmail's fantasy supplement is a direct copy of Tolkien and that formed the basis of D&amp;D before Gygax even got involved.\n\nIOW, D&amp;D was full of Tolkien before Gygax started working on it due to fan interest. All Gygax could really do was try to emphasize the non-Tolkien things he liked. "", 'Gygax is nowhere near as interested in a work of mythology than a work of adventure. It doesn\'t surprise me that he\'d want the mythology as little more than a backdrop for his stories, with the rollicking adventure put further to the forefront (after all he does mention ""thoroughly enjoying the Hobbit"" in the aforementioned article). \n\nIt seems to me that you\'re just baiting for salt or fishing for outrage. Who cares whether or not Gygax liked it, he was certainly not the be all end all of fantasy ... and neither was Tolkein.']"

Even the now well-known and socially influencing slogan of “25% of the time, they work every time” wasn’t enough to help Dr Corden recover from the shame that the night in question brought them.\n\nA NIGHT TO REMEMBER\n\nDr Corden was so confident in their skills when they designed their patented ‘Totally Competent Robot Helpers’ that they put in no fail-safes in case of malfunction. Nor did they think to put in any precautions for the launch night, in case any of the Totally Competent Robot Helpers failed to attend to their duties properly. In fact, all of the staff at the event were robots of Dr Corden’s design.The only issue was that Dr Corden’s Totally Competent Robot Helpers were far from totally competent. In fact, they were only totally competent 25% of the time.\n\nTHE RULES\n\nYou are all playing as the staff at Dr Corden’s Robot Extravaganza. This, of course, means that you are none otherthan the cutting edge in Totally Competent Robot Helpers.Whenever you attempt an action, you determine its success by rolling a 4-sided dice.\n\n4 – Totally Successful\n\n3 – Mostly Successful\n\n2 – Partially Successful\n\n1 – Total Failure\n\nAs the night goes on, you must try your best to ensure that theevent goes as smoothly as possible.\n\nPICK YOUR ROLE\n\nEach role has a special talent built into its programming. Roll a 4-sided dice to determine your role.\n\n4 – Canapés – *observant* – can change 1s into 2s when trying to read the room or notice events\n\n3 – Drinks – *flare* – can change 1s into 2s when trying to be acrobatic or dexterous\n\n2 – Entertainment – *dazzling* – can change 1s into 2s when trying to distract or charm humans\n\n1 – Security – *muscle* – can change 1s into 2s when trying to use strength or force\n\nDR CORDEN’S LAWS OF ROBOTICS\n\nRobots must also follow Corden’s three laws of robotics that are programmed into them.\n\n1 – A robot may not injure a guest or, through inaction, allow a guest to feel they have received poor service.\n\n2 – A robot must obey orders given to it by guests, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n\n3 – A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\nMALFUNCTION\n\nEvery time you suffer a Total Failure, mark it down. If you get to 4, roll on the Malfunction table. The result takes immediateeffect. Once you have resolved the result, your systems cooldown and you can return to the game. You can reduce your current total by 1 by having a Robot Dance Party (do The Robot!).\n\n4 – *25% of the time, they work every time* – No malfunction\n\n3 – *Electric Sheep* – For a moment, you’re convinced that you’rehuman\n\n2 – *I’ll be back* – Walk away from whatever interaction you arecurrently having\n\n1 – *Daisy, Daisy* – Perform a short song to the nearest human\n\nFOR GMs\n\nThis is the big launch event for Dr Corden’s Totally CompetentRobot Helpers and will be attended by members of the public,members of the press and investors.

The world always knew there were monsters under the bed. The world knew there were boogeymen in closets. The world knows there are things in the woods. Things neither human, nor animal. The world has turned a blind eye on these known things.

There is one emotion that can barricade a person’s natural desire to know what’s out there in the world. Fear.

One day something changed. Something forced that fearful world to break down the barricade and fight. Fight or be defeated. Defeat is not an option.

Welcome to the new world of Unbroken.

Join Boris, Sasha, Walter, Nora, and Jacob as they navigate the new world order in this modern urban fantasy setting using the Urban Shadows system.

**Ep 3.5: Meet Sasha:**

A Minisode starring Sasha.

First, learn about Witches, Psychics, and Mediums in the World of Unbroken in another installment of ""Fact or Fiction?""

Next, meet Sasha as Dawn and Kevin discuss Sasha's creation then hear about Sasha's arrival in Denver.

(2-4 sentences is the minimum.)\n\nAt the end of every session I create a page with headers that breakdown what happened to jog players memories about what happened, since most players fill in the recap the afternoon before a new session. \n\nThis has been my pattern for 13 years now.

A single page that summarizes what they did, what npcs and locations were involved, a piece of art I think relates, and a fun random ""loading screen"" fact about one of those.\n\nHowever my session prep notes are available.  It sounds sacrilegious, but it was one of the best moves I made a while ago.  By sharing notes, it helps us understand how we all think and ""syncs"" our minds together.  They learn how to interpret my designs, and I learn their process of solving things and how they categorize and prioritize information.  Really useful since we\'ve been trying to return to minimal system games where the roleplaying has a more direct impact on mechanics - can\'t do that if everyone has a different idea about how the internal logic of the campaign operates.

We had a 5 year running campaign that created a 240 page (full Word document pages) run summary, with tons of cross commentary by other player, who frequently created ""addendum"" run notes from the perspective of their character. It was awesome. \n\n2) The GM has less work to do, which is not inconsiderable. \n\n3) The GM\'s perspective of ""what happened"" is often quite different from the players. It is very easy for things the GM thought were obvious to have been interpreted differently by the players.

rpg,t3_a7keyv,"Best method for a bell curve with a pourcentile systemHi people,

I try to find the best way to use a bell curve instead of a flat probability curve in many games. It's easy with a d20 because we can use 3d6 or 2d10 or the middle dice of 3d20 (my prefered method). But it's harder with a d100 system.

I try to adapt this to Rolemaster (because sometimes it's too swingy), and I think of using the middle dice of 3d10 for the tens and one dice for units. So I think to roll 4 d10 dices : 3 for tens and 1 for units. This create a d100 bell curve :)

But have you another idea, maybe more easier to handle ?

And finally, do you like bell curve for your games ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a7keyv/best_method_for_a_bell_curve_with_a_pourcentile/,"[""I hack as much as the next guy, but I feel like replacing *the* core mechanic of a game is too much. translating +N bonuses to bell curves can be messy, an increase of one point means drastically different things in terms of outcome if the distribution is not uniform.\n\nThat being said I suggest using [anydice](http://anydice.com) to check whether your ideas have the desired statistical properties. Your idea with 3 tens d10s could work out, though.\n\nTo address your final point, I don't have a problem with bell curves for games, but they certainly need to be tuned well to not make the variance too small for rolls to matter.\n\nAlso, what about just rolling 3d100 (or pairs of d10s) and taking the middle if you like the 3d20 method?\n\n[I added a link to an anydice program to illustrate](https://anydice.com/program/12b46). The distance between green and blue varies over the difficulty class, indicating that +X bonuses work differently now.\n\nThe middle d10 method also gives consistently better results, so the overall level has to be adjusted (roughly +10) [program](https://anydice.com/program/12b47)"", 'Roll percentile twice, and take the average.\n\nIf you get a 53 and a 59, your actual roll is 56. \n\nIf you get a 70 and a 12, your actual roll is 41.

Less drama. ""predictability"" is often a cover-word for ""I\'m tired of improving all the chaos!"".\n\nRolemaster is all about drama in combat. That chaos is part of what makes critical tables so much fun. If your GM is getting exhausted with the chaos, I would suggest they ""let go"". Any decision points leaning on combat are going to have (potentially) wild outcomes.\n\nIf that is no longer appealing, I suggest researching a system that does use bell curves. GURPS 4e would be a great choice for your group. Same tactical options in Rolemaster using a 3d6 roll under system. Likely the eponymous RPG for ""bell curve 3d6 roll under"".', 'You do realize a d20 is still a percentile sysem, but in increments of 5%, right?

rpg,t3_a7i77z,"Games like D&amp;D but with heavier combat and customizability/lighter roleplaying?So, I know this is a bit unusual, but while everyone seems to love the roleplaying aspects of D&amp;D, which is fun from time to time, I'm much more interested in the combat and game mechanic aspects of it. My wife and I are avid fans of games like grim dawn and diablo 3, and I've been playing D&amp;D and various fantasy board games for 20 years now. 

As much fun as roleplaying can be, at the end of the day, sometimes it's just fun to dungeon crawl and kill stuff. And...that's kind of what D&amp;D is and always has been to me. A high fantasy wargame/combat game. 

We've been trying out some pathfinder stuff, mythic and epic rules are pretty fun to play with. The only problem is is that pathfinder as a whole and a lot of modern D&amp;D is designed around having a broad range of roleplaying aspects for your character and not -just- combat, which tends to make playing a combat heavy game a little lackluster even with the fun of mythic rules. 

I was wondering if anyone knew of any other tabletop games out there, or better yet, alternative rule systems for D20, that have a high focus on combat, war, roll-playing. D20 has always been my favorite love of any roleplaying universe.

rpg,t3_a7hnh5,"Lady Blackbird with 4 players (and no Cyrus)I'm about to run a Lady Blackbird one-shot for 4 players. I'm letting everyone play whichever character interests them the most, and poor Cyrus Vance wasn't picked. This presents an interesting challenge in how to run the game, since he's arguably second to Lady Blackbird in how central he is to the plot. Here's how I'm thinking of handling it:

&amp;#x200B;

1. At the start of the game, Cyrus will be imprisoned separately from everyone else. Since he's the captain of the ship, he's being interrogated by the imperials. So now the players have an extra side mission (rescuing Cyrus) while they escape from the Hand of Sorrow.

2. Assuming he's rescued, I plan on giving him a very direct ""let's-just-get-this-over-with-so-we-can-get-paid"" attitude. He won't come up with too many creative ideas himself, which should give the players more opportunities to suggest what to do.

3. Perhaps the Empire would be willing to lift the bounty on his head if he turns over his passengers. There's an opportunity for him to pull a Lando Calrissian.

&amp;#x200B;

rpg,t3_a7g4jr,"Need some help for the worldbuilding of the Mass Effect campaign based on a Traveller campaign (long post)# Intro

Hi there,

I was always intrigued by the idea to play a campaign within the Mass Effect universe. This could  become reality next year after my group wrap up our current D&amp;D  campaign. Instead of starting at zero, I will adapt [""Pirates of Drinax""](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/218046/The-Pirates-of-Drinax) because it will save at least 50% of the prep work.

Unfortunately  the campaign setting is written very closely within the lore of the  original setting but still enough random space opera to turn it into  Mass Effect with some mental exercise. The original premise is:

""In  the Pirates of Drinax, the Travellers play a band of adventurers   entrusted by the King of Drinax with a letter of marque, permitting them   to prey on ‘illegal’ trade within the borders of the vanished kingdom.   The King hopes this piracy will give him the leverage he needs to  restore Drinax to its former glory, and intends for the Travellers to  win back all the planets lost over the last two centuries – but the  King’s plans are just the starting point for this campaign.""

Now  the player characters (in their ship) are thrown onto a sector map with  the star system of the king as starting point. They are surrounded by  many factions which don't want the old kingdom rise up again.

# The Mass Effect premise...

Let's  say Shepard did the paragon playthrough with the destruction ending. 5  years later, the galactic society is still in bad shape after the Reaper  War and the Citadel Council is still struggling to regain the influence  and power within its own borders. Most of the ships are destroyed and  most the troops/Spectres are dead but the galaxy is too vast for the  rest and some old and new factions out there are eager to fill this  power vacuum. The Council comes up with plan to send the left Spectres  and troops to one deserted colony or spacestation per sector and start  to hire local ""freelancers"" (like the player characters) to regain the  control in a long run.

Do you have other ideas for the premise?

# Factions, Factions, Factions

Now  comes the part which I have the most struggles with. Which factions are  now out there?! There should be only a few major and many minor  factions. My ideas so far:

* After  the cure of the Genephage, the Krogans need more planets for the  population growth. If every clan does it on their own, there will be  many minor factions but if they start a stellar empire together they  could became a major faction very quickly.
* The Raloi could start claiming systems (in case the Reapers weren't interested to destroy them) and appear as minor faction.
* Some human colonies could become follower of the Cerberus manifesto and establish a minor faction.
* Somewhere  outside of the galaxy is an very old colony ship and a small fleet  (hidden in an E-Zero nebula) of the last Protheans, which wake up after  the destruction of the Reapers. Now they want the galaxy back... This  could start minor but can become a major faction.

Do you have more ideas?

I've been working on an RPG of my own as a pet project but the topic of Magic is really throwing a spanner in the works. I've always been a fan of systems where Magic is more free-flow and Players can build/create their own effects. The problem is all the systems I've seen that do this are also VERY crunchy.

Even the very low to the ground games I've read seem to just toss in the towel when it comes to Magic and provide a Spell List, I certainly have read far from every offering out there though.

So have you ever seen a non-crunchy but free-flow Magic system? What did you like/dislike about it? How would you tweak it or make your own?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a7flkn/magic_without_preconstructed_spells/,"['The old world of darkness ""Mage: The Ascension"" rules were pretty good, if you just take the core mechanics and leave the rest up to arbitration.', 'Maze Rats is a really un-crunchy game with a cool magic system.  Basically , for the character\'s daily spell they roll 2d6 and look at a chart.  The chart has six columns of six words each.  I if the d6 rolls indicates what column you look at, and the other d6 tells you which word from that column you pick.  You basically do this twice so that you have two descriptive words and that\'s your spell.   \n\nSo say your two words are ""creeping"" ad ""smoke"".  It\'s up to the player and GM to decide what a spell invilving ""creeping"" and ""smoke"" actually does.  Maybe it fills a room and blinds everyone.  Maybe it specifically targets someone\'s airways and suffocates them.  It\'s sort of up to the imagination of the players.  But then after the spell is used up, they have to wait a day and re-roll on the magic chart the next day and get a new spell.  Maybe the next day\'s spell is ""regenerating"" and ""echo"".  Now all you have to do is figure out what a spell involving ""regenerating"" and ""echo"" would do.', ""When I run either Fate or Risus, magic is mostly freeform, and my approach for both is similar: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Player describes what they're doing, which must be in keeping with the character's established theme.\n\n2) I set a target number, based mostly on the degree to which the desired effect will derail the session, then tell the player what roll they'll need.\n\n3) If they're OK with that they go ahead and roll, if not we'll figure out what they need to do to bring the target number down to something they can live with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far, this has worked just fine.

There are no extra levels added for duration as we only want it to go off, not stick around. The final spell level is 40 which is quite high but this is a powerful spell that will harm even the mightiest of a kings knights', 'Dresden Files RPG has a great system for magic', ""Rituals in Dungeon World and Blades in the Dark essentially allow you to accomplish anything, but often require a conversation with the GM about what they cost.\n\nUse Magic in Monster of the Week seems pretty free flow, but that's only from listening to The Adventure Zone. I don't know how it works in practice."", ""For me my favorite method of making a free flowing magic system is to take a game that has a standard magic system of spells and just give the players more freedom of movement within the spells.  For a specific system - Shadow of the Demonlord.  When we play our Final Fantasy-esque campaign, we have class swapping which comes with magic swaps which essentially enables a free flowing system despite using constructed lists.\n\nSo for example take your typical dnd spell lists.  Instead of having the players pick individual spells to know.  You just give them access to a whole school of magic or just the entire list.  And then you just either import more spells or write your own as needed.  The thing about a lot of these spell lists is that they already do pretty much everything especially if you've been with it for a while and have a lot of spell expansions throughout rpg history.  And then just combine with a good GM with a group that practices the idea that the printed rules are secondary to the improvisation at the table.  In order for a game to empower roleplaying, they have to give up treating the printed rules as unmovable.\n\nThe thing I found about most free flow magic systems that lead me here is that players will construct spells with the free flow magic systems...and in the end, they just rebuild those spell lists in their own way.\n\nThe exception to this are more Narrative Systems, because those systems don't really care about the particulars and are more focused on the broad strokes of narrative resolutions to conflicts.  So you just make up the specifics, it doesn't quite matter to the system beyond the general idea of how your character is trying to resolve a conflict."", 'The Burning Wheel has a fun free-form magic system.', ""GURPS allows this to a greater or lesser degree depending a bit on your style. The system was designed to be modular, but the way magic is handled can be a bit confusing if you don't know the system.\n\nLoosely, magic is sorted into *colleges*: Air, Fire, Mind, Tech, etc. Within each college is a list of effects: Purify Air, Create Food, Understand Language, and so on. These aren't spells exactly; the stats define relative difficulty and power levels.\n\nFor example, a bolt spell costs 1 magic power per 1d6 damage whether it's a Fire Bolt, Shock Bolt, or Psi Bolt. Same effect, different flavour. Put in more energy, get a bigger bolt. Secondary effects (setting things on fire, stunning someone wearing metal) cost more and are separate (usually treated as percentage cost increase + difficulty).\n\nPower costs are mitigated by having a high skill which is learned separately. How exactly this is all put together varies a bit depending on magic system in play, but the version I like has the players learning a college then having access to various powers within that college. The first time they try to use a given power they have to make a skill check to see if they know that effect; if not, they need to study more.\n\nSome effects have prerequisites. Walk on Air requires Shape Air, which requires Create Air, which requires Purify Air or Seek Air. I treat these as difficulty modifiers, so Walk on Air requires Air Magic knowledge -3 (1 per req).\n\nExample: Larry comes across a chasm and wants to cast Walk on Air, but only has an Air Magic skill of 12. Since Walk on air has three prereqs, that makes his effective skill 9. To cast, he'll need to roll 9 or less on 3d6. It will cost 3 MP + 1 minute per attempt. On success the effect lasts 1 minute + 2 MP/minute (no roll) to maintain thereafter.\n\nThere are alternate ways to interpret the magic system in the book. Also, because the system was designed to be modular, you can apply systems from other genres (supers, ultratech, psionics) and just call it magic. The system is designed for point value to be reasonable aligned between types.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"", 'Best approach I\'ve seen is to trust the DM. You should probably give the DM a table of effects and costs/difficulties. The player describes what they want to happen and if it\'s on the table the DM uses that, and if it\'s not the DM still can refer to the table to guess. It helps if you only have a small number of levels of power, like how Warrior Rogue &amp; Mage by Stargazer Games had only 4 ""circles"" of magic which their freeform magic system variant used.\n\nWith this approach, you do need to make sure you properly balance damage spells. You need to figure out how to, on the fly, balance the spread of accuracy, range, number of targets, and damage. Maybe make a separate more granular table for each of those and they add up.', ""Zozer Games has small ruleset that I use for 2d6 games. You can find it at drivethrurpg. It's called Fast Magic.

It\'s still a work in progress, but I\'m fairly happy with it.\nYou can find it here: https://incursionrpg.com/\n\nSo, onto what I\'ve learned. This will be a fairly long list of things to avoid and consider, as how magic is implemented can change the type of game drastically. For all of this, I will focus solely on freeform magic systems.\n\n- 1) Component Risks: Most free-form systems seem to be created by adding multiple components together to create an effect. This is how Ars Magica, WoD\'s Mage games, and my own game work. As components add together, you can get a higher DC to cast the spell, higher mana cost, higher risk of something going wrong, etc. Component systems face several challenges though. Highly complex spells tend to be more difficult to cast, even though they may not be more powerful. Deciding what constitutes as a magical component can be difficult. If most spells require too many components then the system will become too complex, with spell creation too slow. Lastly, you can lack some specialization provided in traditional spell-list games. \n\nThese risks can be mitigated though. Reduce general/core components to a minimal amount, and have their base costs equal zero. For example, in my game, all spells must have a range, duration, and area component, but a range of 0, area of 1 target, and duration of instant, all equal 0, adding minimal complexity to simpler spells. Some core components can be given to player chosen specialties (Knacks from influences in my game), emphasizing specialized magical talents. Keeping numbers low will help keep math from slowing a game down. Finally, since the game is an rpg and not bound by code, you can simply state that players may add additional components at zero cost as long as the components add no mechanical benefit (flare components).\n\nFor Component Categories, make sure you understand what each category represents. In my game, ""Matter"" represents matter as a scientific concept, as does Forces. With enough control in each, a mage can control Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. However, in the show Avatar: The Last Airbender, Water, Earth, Fire, and Air don\'t strictly follow a scientific understanding, but a spiritual one, allowing water to heal, Fire to destroy and purify, Air for spiritual travelling, and Earth to listen to the environment. \n\n- 2) Adjusting Damage for spells: This is an issue in all spell casting games, not just free-form. A caster creates a fireball that does X damage, or creates a bolder in the air to fall on a target, or teleport a pebble into an enemy\'s heart. With freeform spells, creative deadly uses of spells are simply more difficult to avoid and prevent.\n\nLike before, there are ways to mitigate these threats. Allow players to be scary powerful, but give players (and some NPCs/Monsters) inherent ability to avoid magical attacks (perhaps by spending their own magical resource). Tie damage to a spell\'s DC- making harder spells to cast also hit harder, and allowing simple spells to become higher DC simply to focus their damage. I use damage as an example here, but the same can be said with push-strength, defense, and probably a number of other qualities.\nMainly, ensure that damage can be based off of something, whether it be a declared value, a paid-for value, or a calculated value. Otherwise player arguments are more likely.\n\n- 3) Resource Use: What resource does casting a spell / creating a spell cost? Perhaps spells cost nothing, but more powerful spells are simply more difficult to cast. Maybe they cost more of a magical resource, or health. Maybe they increase the chance of something bad happening. Spending more time to cast a spell might lower the costs. So might having tributes, sacrifices, or alternate energy sources.\n\n- 4) Avoid infinite combos: Don\'t let player use magic to increase any stat that would improve their ability to use magic. Likewise, if you have healing, make sure it has a cap (time, mana costs, etc).\n\n- 5) Keep to a single roll! - Magic can be complicated. Creating a spell, casting a spell successfully, seeing if the target avoids the spell effect, seeing if the spell has any negative effect on the caster, etc. No matter how many deriviations you want to result from spell casting, make sure they can all resolve from one roll! (this is an issue Shadowrun and Dresdenfiles have, in what are otherwise good systems).\n\n- 6) Game Theme: How spells affect the world and caster will change the theme of the game. Call of Cthulhu spells might cost sanity. DnD spells are limitted by spell slots. WoD Mage games have a chance of invoking a paradox (something bad happens). These effects represent the theme of the games they are in. In incursion, spells are unlikely to have a bad effect, and backlashes are both good and bad for a mage. As a result of the power behind mages, inherent ease-of-death for humans, and minimal consequence of casting a spell, Incursion works best in games that emulate a sense of realism, with retreat more common in a heroic fantasy game such as DnD.\n\n- 7) Consider non-component systems, such as in Fate\'s Dresden Files system, where the description of the spell is the main consideration. As long as different descriptions lead to different outcomes, the system will be somewhat rewarding. I\'m even working with a friend to make a deck-based spell casting system (which has many challenges on its own).\n\n- 8) Complex Games: In games where players create their own spells, expect many a work-around over puzzles and challenges. This might make GMing more difficult or easier depending on the situation. Just be ready for someone to teleport the BBEG off a cliff. ', 'You should probably take a look at Open Legend RPG.\n\n""Magic"" in that game is really just the application of banes and boons (negative/positive effects). It really gives you the opportunity to change HOW your magic acts based on your needs (or even whims).\n\nAre you a fire mage? You can throw a fireball that burns a target over several turns... or knocks an enemy back... or knocks them down...or is suddenly hits a wide area instead of a single enemy... etc\n\nThe entire ruleset is available online for free: https://openlegendrpg.com/core-rules/03-banes-boons', ""Dragonlance: Fifth Age.\n\nThere are two flavors of magic, sorcery (matter and energy) and mysticism (life). Characters can have training in one or both. Each flavor has spheres like: Aeromancy, Enchantment, Healing, and Necromancy. A spell has 5 components: invocation time, range, duration, target, and effect. Each component costs 1 to 5 points. The total cost of the spell denotes its casting difficulty and mana cost.\n\nThe system is quite simple. It uses cards, so it's hard to find, and if you buy it on drivethroughrpg you won't have the deck. It is enough to read the magic system, which is probably enough."", ""One magic system I've never seen implemented in a game, but would really love is that from the Death Gate Cycle. It's based on quantum physics (though it's never directly stated). The ccasters use runes (drawn/danced or spoken/sung). These runes pull forth alternate realities to create thier effects. The more divergent the alternate reality, the harder it is. E.g. A reality where one loaf of bread is really two, isn't as tough as one where a rock is actually a loaf of bread, or creating bread from nothing. Anything is possible, but there are no set spells. The casters are only limited by their understanding and experience manipulating the rune magic. "", 'Tribe 8 has very low crunch, freeform magic.\n\nNo spells, but weaving Dream energy to affect/change reality.\n\nOr higher crunch you get Mage the Ascension/ Ars Magica/ Dark Ages Mage. You have scores in categories of effects, and combine them to cast your spells. Pretty easy to raise or lower the crunch based on their framework - definitely worth the read. Actually add Changeling the Dreaming into this pile, for a similar yet different approach.\n\nSlightly higher crunch again is Spellcasting for wizard superheroes in Wild Talents. A Dr Strange Expy is gonna be a powerhouse, but the player’s doing a lot of math/ fiddling every time he crafts a new spell.', ""There's the [Four by Five system](http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/4by5.html) designed for Fudge.

The possible targets are Body, Mind, Spirit, Energy, and Matter.\n\n* Potency: This can be Fair, Good, Great, or Superb. Spells with high potency can do more, but they are also more difficult to cast."", 'If you are interested in something where you can really go nuts with magic, try Nobilis. You play as one of the Nobilis (essentially a god of something) and you can do pretty much anything within your domain.', 'There\'s a french RPG, ""Insectopia"", which has a free-form magic system.\n\nDepending on your ""class"", you have access to 4 of the magic spheres (life, water, mind, etc...) and some of the 4 words of power (attack, alteration, control, knowledge) for each of them.\n\nWhen you want to cast a spell, you chose a magic sphere and a word of power, and then define it\'s limits with a chart (basically if you want it to affect more people or a larger area, have more range or last longer you add difficulty to the test).\n\nLet\'s make an example :\n\nI\'m a Chaman so I have access to the Water, Wood, Life and Totem spheres.I want to make a wood bridge over a ravine, so I\'ll use the word of power ""alteration"" for my wood sphere (after checking I have access to this word of power for this sphere).I look at the area part of the chart, I see that by increasing difficulty by 2 I can set it to ""a room"" which is enough for my bridge.Also I want it to stay longer, so I add 2 difficulty to make it last ""x hours"", x being my magic sphere mastery level.No need to add more to it, size and duration of the spell are good, so I make my casting test of difficulty 4, and if I succeed I\'ll have a bridge (yay).\n\nThe rules for casting are that you have a base modifier of -2 but you can prepare the spell for up to 4 actions, giving you +1 per action, interesting mechanic in this system, makes the spells feel like Dragon Dogma\'s ones a bit (need some time to cast but can be very powerful).In our bridge example the Chaman will probably take his time and have a +2 modifier, so even if his wood sphere skill is low, it should work.\n\nIt\'s a pretty good base for free-form magic, but set in a kinda specific system. We\'re playing insects and are drawing colored marbles with each color corresponding to a level of success/failure instead of rolling dices. Sounds weird but it\'s fun I swear.\n\nThere\'s like half a panel on the GM screen for spell rules, I could send a picture of it if you want, and even translate it if you ask nicely.', 'What I\'ve done for simple games I\'ve run is use a ""word magic"" system. Basically, whenever someone wants to cast a spell, they literally just put together some words, usually a verb and a noun, with adjectives thrown in as boosters. Like ""create fire"", ""control water"", ""move \\[a\\] large \\[amount of\\] earth"". That last only counts as three words in my system, because it\'s about the core ""ideas"" of what you\'re trying to do: it would actually be written as ""move large earth"" for simplicity. I usually also require a hand free to gesture at targets or target areas, unless you use enough extra words, or specific enough words, to specify the target(s) without needing to... ""slay \\[target\'s true name\\]"", for example, or ""create fire around me"".\n\nThen all you have to do is come up with some basic guidelines. The main ones you\'ll need are things like how much of a given material can be affected with a single spell, exactly what multipliers are applied by using size-related adjectives (does ""move large earth"" move 2x as much as ""move earth"", or 10x as much?), the amount of damage spells can deal, and so on. The main things I always make sure to have guidelines for are the specific mechanics needed for range, damage, area, mass, and duration.\n\nFinally, you\'ll need a limit on the use of these words. Things like a skill check based on the number of words, or a point pool with each word costing X points, as well as what limit (if any) is placed on how many words can be combined into a single spell, and whether or not you have to learn specific words of power (and thus possibly having a limit on the number of words known) or if you can just string together any words you want.', 'Dresden Files in the fate system had a pretty free-form system.\n\nBasically, pick an element, or theme, or if the character is powerful enough multiples or everything.\n\nThen you had a skill, a stat, and usually an item or two to roll.  There were two factors, one skill,stat,item for the power of the spell, and a second different set for the control of the spell.\n\nSo if you had a wizard with less power but much better control, they could be more like a sniper with a lightning bolt, or a lock picker with fine tuned telekinesis, or short out specific electronics from range.\n\nA wizard who had more power but less control could create a wall of water for defense, a wave of flame, or blast a door off its hinges.\n\nHow you used the power, control, and elements were up to you, the rolls just determined how successful you were at doing your goal.  Sometimes the super controlled wizard gets a bad roll and their ultra-targeted hypnotic display in front of someones face turns into a beautiful, but harmless, night-club light show across the side of a building.', ""I've always thought the power creation rules in *Wild Talents* could work really well for a magic system, even though it's a superhero RPG.""]"

rpg,t3_a7djqo,"Supers revised - help on designing a final 'boss' in a campaignHey, thought I'd come on here for advice. I
want to make sure that I don't put my players through a stupid end of campaign
encounter.

I'm running a superhero campaign. It's going to start out campy, then very deconstructive in the middle (venture brothers/one punch man) and then I was going to have a gonzo save the world end to it.

I have one adversary planned. What's important isn't her backstory but how challenging she might be.

One of the possible villains is a dimensional cosmic horror in a human shell. Because she crossed over to a weird dimension, it's changed her form into an immortal one governed by perception sustaining her existence. She can't die by normal means because someone over in the real world possesses the connection with her that sustains her body.

 If she is unable to use him as a phylactary of sorts, her existence will gradually become intangible and will eventually lose her form (she gets about a week tops, less if the PCs fight her in direct combat and cause attrition after her invulnerability loss). Even if she successfully converts him into a phylactary, she still has an inanimate object that can be destroyed and will have the same effect on her. 

This villainess is going to go on a global personal murder spree the second she comes back into existence. She is going to be played as ruthless and inhuman. I don't want to make her unbeatable in direct combat but I want to seed the idea that things like her exist so that it doesn't become a case of the party running headlong into a fight  and getting them killed. Like it's not a tactical fight but a strategic fight. 

If the party unleashed her, what can I do to make sure that its not a bullshit rocks fall everyone dies end to the campaign?

Tools I'm thinking about:

- I've got four ex - teammates of the villain who she will target first. They'd get killed quickly in a direct fight but all of them would work with the players to figure out how to put her down (not to steal the spotlight from the players).
- I'm trying to take the weird science angle but I need a tool to explain how the silly tangiblity of the villain works without dumping hot molten exposition all over them, boring them. 
- I want them to be able to try different methods of defeating her/ sealing her away. What stupid pseudoscience gimmick could I use as additional options for the players if they go for a weird angle? 

Thanks ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a7djqo/supers_revised_help_on_designing_a_final_boss_in/,"['I find that subtlety only has to go over the head of one person for them to fuck everything up.

Just...be careful. Players don\'t like to be the little fish. Most of the time a ""boss"" is something that the players, working together, are all but guaranteed to defeat. The key is changing their perception and if you fail they\'ll go in and die and feel like you pulled a bait-and-switch.\n\nI\'ve had players be shit-scared of things that were nuisances at best (to the point, tbh, where I clearly went too far and received complaints about my ""bullshit"" miniboss they butchered without even *taking any hits*.)

So maybe they\'re fighting or something, the alien gizmo starts acting up, and suddenly she\'s taking damage and it\'s obvious to the characters that she\'s taking hits? Or something along a similar nature (poorly performed magic ritual, etc) where her coverage isn\'t perfect/absolute. Hmm... Phylactery Person could simply be the mechanic she\'s using to keep the Gizmo running.\n\nMaybe something like the Babylon 5 Vorlon route? Have one of the existing races in the game come to the party\'s rescue, explaining that once they thought they were all that, made certain gizmos, realized they had a problem and backed-off.

The original device (It\'s known as a Resonator in a Charles Stross novel) affects the pineal gland, allowing people to see other realities. The players need to make one that affects the pineal gland in such a way as to conceal the big boss from humanity (ie blocking them from perceiving her reality). This causes her to lose tangibility in the earthly plane, so she\'s out of phase with it. If she can\'t interact with their reality, she can\'t affect it, and is thus neutralized. ']"

rpg,t3_a7ba5z,"So, I'm gonna do a Oneshot for my parents between Christmas and new year. It's their very first time roleplaying at all. What should I do?They are both about 55 years old, my brother is also joining us and the only thing that's certain is that we are going to play an RPG. I have no clue what system is best for this situation, or what kind of story etc. Perhaps you can share some of your experiences if you already did something like that. 

They are certainly interested in movies like LotR, Star Wars, Harry Potter and read a lot of books etc. + were very curious ""what that Pen &amp; Paper is"" I and my brother always play together with our friends in our free time.

My wife played, and had played a few session with me previously.\n\nMy advice - go with a dead-simple system. Don\'t make them read anything, learn anything, etc. I made one up on the spot. The rules, in there entirety, were this:\n\n1. You have four attributes - Brains, Brawn, Agility, and Charisma. You have 10 points to put between them, none can be higher than 4 or less than 1.\n2. If you want to do something risky, roll a number of dice (d6) equal to your ability rating. If the highest result is a 6, you do the thing. If it\'s a 4 or 5, you do the thing but there\'s a complication. If it\'s a 1-3, you don\'t do the thing and there\'s a complication. If you roll 2 or more 6\'s things go great! (I just stole this right from Blades in the Dark)\n3. You get one special ability. We\'ll make it up together. (My father in-law wanted to be a good fighter, so I gave him a bonus die for fighting rolls and let him sacrifice his shield to avoid damage, my sister-in-law wanted to be good with animals, so I let her bump up her results on any Charisma roll with animals one level, my wife wanted to be a mage so I let her cast minor spells by using Brains instead of some other ability when she could justify it narratively).\n4. You have hit-points equal to your brawn. You might lose these if you take damage. You\'re knocked out if you lose all of them, and dead if you go negative.\n\nThat was it. It went really well - character creation took just a few minutes, they picked up the rules no problem, and we had a fun little one-shot. I dropped them right into the action - imprisoned on an airship and encouraged their creative problem solving. I said ""yes"" a lot - more than I would have for seasoned players and/or a more serious campaign.\n\nIf you want a more traditional experience, I\'d recommend [The Black Hack](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition).

[Lady Blackbird](http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/lady_blackbird.pdf) is another good recommendation for a more narrative game, as it\'s charming, simple, and set up for a quick one-shot.

I’m more familiar with the lore and the environment. \n\nA very close second for me is the game system. I learned SWRPG first and got used to the system, then I tried D&amp;D later, and I hated how limited I felt. In SWRPG the system uses narrative dice that give you various levels of success or failure. Example: you fail to hit your enemy target, but maybe you were granted an advantage that helps out, like you hit a control panel instead that brings a blast door crashing down and prevents enemy reinforcements from getting there. It’s a very cinematic experience where PCs and the GM work together to tell a fun story.

rpg,t3_a7a28f,"Do dice mechanic have an impact for the mood, style and substance ?Hello people,

I'm an somewhat old gamemaster who want to play a grim and gritty med-fan game.

I've played a lot of years to Rolemaster (RM2/Classic) and the mood of the game has Always been gritty because of the critical tables and maybe because of the d100 involved.

And at this time, I question myself about the dice, and the mood of the dice in game.

In my opinion, if I launch many d6, or 1d20, the game have a ""game"" mood, somethink like videogame, comics or boardgame. When I use a d100 mechanic, I've a ""simulation"" mood, making gritty ambiant more easy to install.

It's just in my head, or are you experience this too ? (you need to have played pourcentile games for sense the difference by the way)

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT : Let me clarify : I talk about the choice of the dice, not the choice of the mechanic (I cannot edit the thread title sadly).  
I can obtain a bell (gaussian) curve with d20 or d100 (Rolling 3d20 and keep the middle dice, or Rolling 3d10 and keeping the middle dice for decimals).

I talk about the dice, the object. Do a d100 is more ""realistic"" than a d12, for example :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a7a28f/do_dice_mechanic_have_an_impact_for_the_mood/,"['It\'s not the dice mechanics themselves so much as the implications of those dice on the fiction, I think.\n\nIn PbtA, for example, your TN is always the same and the most common result is ""success, but"", which lends a sort of tension to every element of the game. There\'s no such thing as a sure thing, and the game tends to reflect that. If you want an unrelentingly tense game, systems like this are good.\n\nIn games with low dice variance like Fate, where the roll skews toward zero, your skill matters more than the dice, which places emphasis on what you are and aren\'t good at. A character acting in their element can be relatively at-ease about their chances, while forcing a character to act outside their wheelhouse causes a sudden spike in tension as the character is suddenly at much greater risk of failing, or at least of having to burn resources in order to succeed. If you want to be able to fine-tune how much pressure the PCs are under, systems like this are good.\n\nIn games with high dice variance like d20, the dice cause a sort of random swinginess to the mood, spiking excitement when big numbers come up, and tension when small ones do. The dice matter more than the character\'s skill, which lends the action a large degree of uncertainty that some people like and some don\'t. If you want to be surprised by outcomes often, systems like this are good.\n\nGames with dice pools, like Shadowrun, combine elements of both low- and high-variance, depending on the size of the pool. Rolling lots of dice is fun, and maximizing the number of dice on a roll becomes a metagame unto itself, but the slower resolution versus a single or small number of dice lends the game a more measured, cerebral aspect. If you want a game you have to think and calculate your way through, systems like this are good.', 'There certainly is such a thing as mechanical atmosphere. Though the difference I see has always been between dice pools and single dice, regardless if they are d20 or d100.\n\nA single dice has a flat probability curve: You are as likely to roll a 1 or a 20 (100) as you are any number in between. This makes every roll ""swingy"" and the dice matter as much, or even more than any boni you have on the roll. So in D&amp;D a +10 is quite substantial, but the roll brings up to 20 points and thus a +0 character could well do better than a +10 character.\n\nWith additive dice pools, like FATE or 3d6 systems you have a gaussian distribution and are far more likely to roll a middling result. This way, characters will much more often perform as expected and really bad or good results are outliers and results of sheer luck. Here you get characters that are specialists in their field and will routinely outperform untrained characters.\n\nThe same basically goes for success based dice pools, although here characters get more predictable results the better they are in a skill (and the more dice they can roll). So character progression directly translates into being ""more sure"" that you can do a thing. Untrained characters can still try and gamble to do a thing, while competent characters are all but sure to succeed.\n\nThis all also depends heavily on the system and the numerical values of the abilities and boni involved, but this has been my general understanding of the different systems.', ""I feel like there is a perception/implication, like d100% is more detailed, since it's more granular (despite having to be incredibly detail oriented to not just make all your mechanics be in steps of 5% anyway), so it's more realistic/simulationist (despite not even being correlated).\n\n...

Remembering that there is such thing as narrative pacing, and you need downtime to provide contrast for when things get harrowing. A hard 6-8 encounter day is only meaningful if you’ve had relatively easy days. \n\nGoing a step further people will often justify with something like: “Well that makes certain classes useless.” Which isn’t really true, those classes are just as effective at the beginning of the day as they are the end. Your fighter is just as good at hitting things throughout the day. What you’re arguing is that in order to be useful certain classes have to lose their effectiveness. If that’s the case, you have bigger problems than unchallenging days.\n\nAnother step down is is “Well it gives certain players a chance to shine.” Which is a good argument for having some 6-8 hard encounter days. But if they are the rule than having a chance to shine looses its luster. If every day is filled with such encounters, it’s not giving these characters a chance to shine, it’s putting them in the spot light.\n\nAnd the final doll is: “Well it’s about challenge!” Which has a kernel of truth. Most good games are challenging. After all, if your story is great but you walked through everything to get here, the victory is certainly less sweet. But good challenge requires contrast. What makes challenge worth it if you don’t have time to take it in? Every day of challenge is grueling, and it’s hard to appreciate. And there is merit in throwing your party a soft ball every now and again to make your players feel like badass heroes.

rpg,t3_a76eao,"Check out ""Lost Dice"", my new narrative RPG for all settings! Hi, Alex from True Mask Games here.

My new book has been released. A short one this time, only 14 pages, but packed with material! ;)

You can grab it right here on DriveThruRPG: [Lost Dice](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/261687/Lost-Dice--a-narrative-RPG-for-all-settings)

 ""Lost Dice"" is a simple and modular rulesystem suited for all kinds of  RPGs (horror, fantasy, sci-fi and everything in between).  
 It  focuses on supporting narrative descriptions by both the players and the  GM and creating a fast-paced game where the players have, with every  single die roll, the chance to decide just how much they are willing to  risk for victory. The more dice they  roll, the higher their chances...but every dice they roll can be lost.  Thus, as more and more dice disappear, characters are getting weaker and  more desperate. The perfect opportunity to introduce them to a little  rule I call ""unleashing the dark side""... ;)

Looking forward to your feedback and please let me know if you have any questions! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a76eao/check_out_lost_dice_my_new_narrative_rpg_for_all/,"[""Hmmm, I'm torn here.

rpg,t3_a75xm4,"Demon - The Descent, PactsI’ve been flicking through the rulebook as, for once, I’m not DMing and actually get to play a character. 

Anyways, I’m reaching a bit of uncertainty about the Pacts, Patchwork covers and so on. 

Of particular note is when pacts take effect. Is t instantaneous? For both parties? Must an aspect you steal from a victim’s life be grafted onto a cover instantaneously? Or can it be held in a metaphorical bag of available grafting aspects for when someone wants a new cover?

Does the victim of the pact maintain access to that aspect of their life until it’s cashed in? I’m unsure of it. It mentions things like soul pacts being able to be cashed in whenever, with the victim reaping the benefits until that point in true Faustian fashion. 

I was also reading one of the stories bundled in a lore book. When a demon was forging pacts to cobble together a new identity from the Columbus Three, he simply said he’d owe them a favour. Is that a valid benefit for a pact, perhaps manifesting as a drawback for the demon or the victim, depending on who took that point? That mirrors the Lucifer TV series, in a weird way. 

I’ve also wondered, as a total aside, if it’s possible to use a pact in a way to force someone to sign another pact. The example I envisioned revolves around giving a man riches beyond his imagination, letting him enjoy it for a bit and then leveraging it over him to get his soul if required. Is that legal? Or does that violate the fact that pacts must be transparent? 

The rules also mention that a demon can’t lie during a pact. But can he be vague? Say he’s bargaining for a person’s soul. He’s honest in that he’s taking that as the price, but can he be vague about the specifics of what it entails so long as he doesn’t straight up lie?

Sorry for the ramblings, I’m just curious as I build up the basis of my character. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a75xm4/demon_the_descent_pacts/,"['All of this is pretty vague or only implied in the book, so the best answer is ""whatever you and your storyteller agree on."" However, regarding vague wording, I seem to recall it saying that demons like to make the wording air-tight so there\'s no wiggle room for humans, and that the contract must state what is required in a way the human can understand if they read it carefully (but they can be encouraged not to read it carefully, ie threatened or intoxicated or charmed). That implies to me that vague wording is something the *human* can take advantage of. But regarding Soul Pacts, it specifically says that humans don\'t understand the full implications of selling their soul until the contract has been signed.\n\n&gt; I’ve also wondered, as a total aside, if it’s possible to use a pact in a way to force someone to sign another pact. The example I envisioned revolves around giving a man riches beyond his imagination, letting him enjoy it for a bit and then leveraging it over him to get his soul if required. Is that legal? Or does that violate the fact that pacts must be transparent?\n\nI\'m not sure what you mean by ""force"" here, but the book gives a pretty clear example of giving someone incredible wealth (or another benefit) for one day to give them a taste, then offering a longer contract with a higher cost.']"

rpg,t3_a7490j,"What should my players do with a spaceship cargo hold full of exotic animals?**Looking for story ideas...**  


I'm running a Traveller game (sci-fi RPG, very Firefly-esque), and the players recently raided a cargo transport and stole all their cargo.

rpg,t3_a70zr8,"[GMing advice] Needless dice rolls vs.sense of achievementI am currently running a campaign using Genesys (a system where fudging rolls by changing the difficulty is impossible) and have run into a bit of a philosophical issue. On one hand, I would like to avoid useless dice rolls for things that a character would usually accomplish or that would be *cool* if a character managed them. In a normal, static-DC system, this is easy - keep difficulties hidden, then just let the player succeed unless their roll is really, really bad. In Genesys, since the difficulty is a number of dice rolled by the player against their own roll, this doesn't work.

This leaves me with the issue of having to decide when to let players roll for success. I realize that ""best practice"" would be to not pick up the dice unless there is an interesting consequence to failure - but what if success without rolling would be not rewarding enough? GMing, in a way, is smoke and mirrors. I see my job at keeping the game fun and rewarding for everyone while keeping up the impression that even dice rolls - random as they may be - are in some way achievements by characters and their players. Neither ""you succeed, no roll necessary"" nor ""you fail, sorry, bad luck"" is cutting it in some situations. 

There probably is no right answer to this, but I'd appreciate any input and opinions!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a70zr8/gming_advice_needless_dice_rolls_vssense_of/,"[""&gt; but what if success without rolling would be not rewarding enough?\n\nThat's a really big **if** there. I completely disagree that there's a sense of achievement (for me personally) for just rolling the dice. I'd be happy to only roll if the outcome is actually uncertain.\n\nI'd say just try it out and see how it works. Maybe you get a unanimous opinion on that. If not, you could just roll the dice to see if there should be a check or something."", 'I\'m not sure about Genesys, but FFG\'s Star Wars games have rules for Simple rolls which are for trivial tasks that can\'t be failed, but that can be passed in ways that give Advantage and Triumph results. Just have them roll unopposed or (if you want a more ""smoke and mirrors"" approach) have them roll against difficulty dice that you ignore when describing the result. The idea of only rolling when failure has an interesting consequence is really for binary systems, throw that idea out when you have more than two result vectors.', 'Success is relative. I prefer systems when all rolls result in proportional outcomes relative to the opposition (either active or just difficulty of a task). \n\nThat way, a roll always has the possibility of changing the outcome of the situation, either greatly positive or unexpectedly negative. \n\nJust as a random example: Sure that hill climb may be trivial for an advanced rock climber... but do they do such an exceptional job that they remove much of the risk for the *other* less-skilled party members by finding a route that is much easier? ', ""I think it's best to determine what the scale of the game will be.  Once you and the players can accurately predict what will be mundane (no rolls) vs. heroic (rolls) actions, things tend to run smoothly.  You definitely don't want to be inconsistent with when you call for rolls or players can feel that they can't form effective strategy.\n\nThe game, Godbound, has some good text about this.  In Godbound you play as demigods, and so it goes into informing GMs how they shouldn't call for rolls for mundane things - and how to determine what would be mundane to a demigod.  For example, a god of war just automatically hit lesser foes.  A character focused on crafting can just fix and create objects  without any checks because it's considered a mundane thing to do.\n\nBut does that sap players of the sense of achievement?  Not really.  Because the game will be a lot more than just that one kind of action.  And if you properly determine where your calibration line is for dice rolls, then you design for events and situations above that line while handwaving stuff below the line.\n\nAlternatively - There's also the focus on empowered roleplaying in which you provide two routes to success. The by the numbers systems and then manual roleplay.  For example, a character could just roll their talky skill to convince a noble to do something.  OR they could manually roleplay a good argument leveraging some key knowledge they learned about the noble (note: roleplay doesn't necessarily mean Acting.  They could just say, my character uses X on Y.)  and you grant an auto success because you figure that would work.  Or it's ambiguous, but you think it would help so you give a significant bonus to the roll - or maybe the opposite if they use the wrong thing.   In this sort of play, the route that doesn't involve the roll at all can actually feel more rewarding to the player because they actually solved a sort of open ended puzzle as a player of a game."", 'In Eclipse Phase there\'s ""Success Tests"" (if I recall correctly that\'s the name). For occasions where the outcome of a test is undeniably positive. Examples may be finding information that is publicly available or things like that.  \n\nIf you feel like having a player roll in such a case, have them roll, then let if and how they succeed determine how long they take to complete that action. They rolled really well? Maybe they found that information right away, or you can award them with some extra lore. They rolled really bad? They just lost some time in that research of theirs.  \n\nOf course, sometimes time is a valuable resource, and having your players lose an hour just to find simple stuff is worse than saying ""You can\'t find it, you\'ll have to take a different approach to the matter"". This isn\'t a key for all holes, just an idea that can work in certain situations, and the example of an approach.', 'Just give them advantage dice? Is not like they loose the advantage even if they fail the roll.', ""Have them make the rolls as normal, but give them boost dice for being awesome. One of the things that I've been considering lately is to give boost dice if they can narratively tie that action to one of their motivations. But if they have a clever idea or are playing their role really well, that's worth a boost or two.\n\nAnecdotally, I've found that players *like* rolling big pools of dice, so I try to let them do that as often as possible.\n\nObviously if an action is trivial or the outcome doesn't matter, don't bother rolling. But I would lean towards more rolls rather than fewer, because the narrative dice results can skew the story in ways that no one expected, and that's fun too."", '&gt; I see my job [as] ... keeping up the impression that even dice rolls - random as they may be - are in some way achievements by characters and their players. \n\nThen you\'ve set an unrealistic job for yourself, because you can\'t turn random numbers into player achievements.\n\n&gt; I realize that ""best practice"" would be to not pick up the dice unless there is an interesting consequence to failure - but what if success without rolling would be not rewarding enough?\n\nYou sound like you have an internal conflict: in one breath, you say that not all risk is interesting, and in the next, that nothing is interesting without risk.\n\nAre your players actually concerned about these things, or is it just your fear? Regardless, it\'s worth talking to your players about expectations and purposes of randomness.', '&gt;I realize that ""best practice"" would be to not pick up the dice unless there is an interesting consequence to failure - but what if success without rolling would be not rewarding enough?\n\nIsn\'t that kind of up to the player\'s approach, though? If they want to open an unlocked door, there\'s no roll. If they want to rip it off its hinges, there\'s a roll. Both of those result in ""enter the room beyond the door"", but it\'s more about how the player wanted to do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;', 'I actually see the inability to fudge dice results as a good thing. Didnt think about Genesys in that way before. 😀', 'For me, there isn\'t anything ""rewarding"" in rolling the dice. There is no player merit in rolling well or player fault in rolling poorly. What happens in the fiction matters and how it is described.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlayer may feel robbed of their success if you just skip what they\'d probably succeed, because they\'d succeed. Instead, set the scene and describe how they overcome it in a cool way, or even better, ask them to describe it. There won\'t be a roll that is unnecessary, but the player will feel that they achieved something.']"

rpg,t3_a70bly,5 Tips For Playing Better Dwarves (cross post from /r/Tabletop),https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a70bly/5_tips_for_playing_better_dwarves_cross_post_from/,"['1. Take damage ... Always finish fight with 1HP\n2. Angry !\n3. Hungry !\n4. Don\'t listen .. At an end of conversation ask : ""What?""\n5. Depressed', ""Hmm! Interesting. I really like the idea of boiling down the essence of these fantasy races, and then playing with some of the peripheral details to get something that feels fresh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor me, the key to Dwarves is the idea of oaths and promises forming the structure of society. Dwarves are aggressively lawful - I think of that as the touchstone of their culture. It underlies their families, their trade and mercantilism, their entire approach to the world. Their stereotypical mountain homes just reinforce the unchanging, unwavering lawfulness, as do their gruff relationships with the flightier, less trust worthy races, or the importance on clan and ancestors. The headspace I try to get into for my dwarf characters is one where the things I say REALLY matter. If you commit to an action, you ALWAYS follow through, no matter the consequences. If someone lies to you, you NEVER forgive them. Or, if you must break these norms, it changes you. It shakes you to your core in a way that other races can never really understand. With that as a starting place, I've had dwarven empires in deserts - where this rigidity allows survival with scarce resources, like Dune, and the craftmanship focused on sand and glasswork. I've had urban dwarves in diverse cities, stalwart supporters of evil tyrants because of oaths they swore years ago and refuse to give up on, knowing full well the consequences but believing that a broken promise is worse. Feudal Japan is another great point of reference - that rigidity and refusal to compromise on promise and responsibility translates neatly into samurai stories, shamed ronin, honor and duty before life itself."", ""Speaking of Dwarves, you know what they're fanatically good at? Sailing.\n\nAll the craftsmanship that normally goes into stone is focused on knot tying, woodworking, and maintenance. Low center of gravity means the rocking boat doesn't faze them. Higher-than-normal strength means that all the rope hauling, sail raising, hatch battening is easier and faster. Hearty constitutions mean that they can subsist on old food for longer, and drink more alcohol with less water. \n\nThose Dwarves who left their mountain and hill based homes in my setting found quick work as sailors, and there's a huge population of sailing men and women who couldn't tell granite from limestone but can predict the weather days in advance and know the currents from the way the ship rocks on the waves.\n\nAnd, obviously, they all speak in Scottish-Pirate accents."", ""Without bothering to read, here are mine:\n\n* Walk on your knees when playing.  This will give you the proper perspective and immerse you in the Dwarven Experience\n\n* Limit alcohol to brews such as mead or ale.  But do not drink to excess.  You're trying to pretend to be a dwarf, not actually be one.  You won't live up to the Dwarven Walking Ale-Retarded Flushedness.\n\n* Beards are important for dwarves, so much so that you should not try to emulate a dwarven beard.  Out of respect, you (the player) should be clean-shaven, so that your own pathetic face-pubes not get in the way of your imaginary Dwarven Beardliness.  \n\n* Read up on War Goats.  They have drastically different care and feeding rituals than you may be accustomed to with standard mounts.  Not like you should be using a mount, but desperate times call for desperate goats.\n\n* Dwarven mating rituals are complex as the sexes are often hard to distinguish.  Therefore, it is not culturally insensitive to ask another dwarf if they are one gender or another.  Never assume gender.  Ask outright."", 'FTFY: 5 Tips for Playing standard D&amp;D/Pathfinder Dwarves', ""My first ever dnd character was a dwarf rogue with insane acrobatics and stealth. Seriously he should have been in cirque du soleil.  He wasn't particularly honourable either. I tried to go against some traditional dwarven traits and then used some to further the character. I miss that guy. Th as my 2 cents."", ""I love the idea of varying the trope races! Like you point out, it's not only boring to always play things by the Tolkein standard, but incredibly narrow-minded. \n\nGreat work, friend!"", 'I like the idea of trying out different biomes for a race. I like the idea of like Hawaiin dwarves living in volcanic tunnels, and maybe a clan per island with some islands connected by tunnel systems. ', ""&gt;Tradition, in this case, refers not to the broader spectrum of their clan or people, but their life experiences. What are they used to, and what do they expect from the world around them? And what things, when they change, will make them feel out-of-sorts, uncomfortable, or even downright angry?\n\nSometimes it's helpful to think about what we mean by terms like 'tradition' and how others might define it. Doing so can shake us out of certain ways of thinking that limit our character concepts. For example, when thinking about the broader traditions of a Dwarven community (not just individual life experiences as /u/nlitherl suggests) I'm inspired by an excerpt from [The Dictionary of the History of Ideas](http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaBook/tei/DicHist1.xml;chunk.id=dv1-73;toc.depth=1;toc.id=dv1-73;brand=default):\n\n&gt;Tradition, likewise, is not identified with a stock of accumulated beliefs, customs, and ways of doing things, but with an ongoing process of intergenerational transmission. *Bildung* and *Tradition* entail culture as both a product and an emergent force at any given time, insofar as *Bildung* leads to shared patterns or forms of life that have become “patterns” by virtue of a greater or lesser degree of institutionalization through *Tradition*. Although Herder opposed the idea of linear progress, he nonetheless refused to view stages of development in a dichotomous manner. Hence, in place of the idea of polarity he advanced the idea of interplay. Tradition and progress no longer embody two opposed tendencies, but a single continuum. Progress, or more precisely change, becomes a built-in characteristic of tradition, and development is seen, therefore, as at once part of a given culture continuum and the instrument for its transformation. It requires not only historical antecedents but also emerging goals pointing to the future.\n\nIn other words, progress (or what we might describe in our games as our characters' adaptations to new experiences/circumstances/etc.) is not antithetical to the traditions of one's community; change is an inherent part of tradition. If your Dwarf discovers something new that changes established views/practices/etc. she doesn't have to suffer cognitive dissonance. Instead, she passes that information along to her people, which is then incorporated into traditional understandings and practices.\n\nCultures change just as people do. Your Dwarf, by virtue of the possibilities inherent in adventure far from home, can be a change-agent in her community."", 'I like to think of Dwarven society as being utterly pragmatic and machine-like.']"

I know I might be."", 'I like historical, but the less aware the players are of the time period the less you can lean on the actual setting and the more you need to lean on the romantacised version. this is true for any RPG setting but especially for historical settings.\n\nFor DnD players, dnd has ""tainted"" their vision of medieval times to such a degree that I can\'t run ""realistic"" settings in that time period anymore. there are all sorts of anachronisms that just don\'t fit.\n\nIt\'s why I like the early modern period (1600\'s/30 years war) a bit more than the medieval one. the nations are more recognizable, the conflicts and logic more sensible to modern players. the tech makes more sense. Guns can be around without completely dismissing all other weapons and armor as obsolete. things are generally more recognizable. class mobility is a bit higher. [see this article for more](https://udan-adan.blogspot.com/2015/07/medieval-vs-early-modern-what.html)\n\nI don\'t know what the default setting/tech level burning wheel is at, but if early guns are available, i\'d consider moving your time period up a few hundred years.', 'If I were going to play in a game where historical accuracy was important, I would want the DM to make up some kind of table of helpful reminders of how things worked in that time period. I wouldn\'t say I\'m totally ignorant of history, but questions like ""how did people communicate across long distances in 1350"" or ""how much land would an average peasant work"" are definitely beyond me. Were there any guns? How big/fast was an average ship? How big is a town, and roughly how far away is the next town? Castles? Fuedalism?', 'I adore historical games, or historical + fantasy.\n\nThat said, Night Witches is probably my #2 favorite game ever, and I’m so hungry to try Dream Apart.', 'I like using Historical settings and then dropping in strange stuff. Currently running a Wild West game with some supernatural elements, similar to Deadlands (though not as ahistorical). ', '(GURPS GM) Personally, I like to inspire myself from real history and anthropology to make my fantasy setting/world a believable world.\n\nSo, if it happens in a medieval-type setting, people will behave like people did in real European Middle-Age : very religious, intolerant, racist, homophobic, sexist with strong gender roles, hierarchical, feudal. It is not meant to be a kind of escapist utopia where people can roam free as ""adventurers"", people who stray from the established norms are persecuted. \n\nSo, it makes playing a female character harder, as in Christian/European Middle-Age, women couldn\'t much leave the house, had to obey their husband and couldn\'t have important role (except very few famous exceptions such as Jeanne d\'Arc or Queen Elisabeth). Same would go with non-religious people, or homosexuals, or people of a different religion, etc... they would have to roleplay in such a way that they manage to hide it in order not to be executed by the clergy or aristocracy. \n\nIn my opinion, it makes for much more interesting roleplay, as if you want to play a character that by the cultural norms of the era wouldn\'t be ""normal"", you\'ll have to find way to survive and live your life despite your difference or role associated to your sex or caste. \n\nI create however different cultures, with each different approaches to these matters, such as : an atheistic culture/race that doesn\'t care about the sex or sexuality of members of its society, but is extremely racist and consider all other races as pets; another one particulary sexist and religiously intolerant, but trying to convert people from other races to their religion, etc...

rpg,t3_a6un2t,"[Game Craft] I wrote a real ""Mysterious journal"" (160 pages) full of occult drawings, puzzles and lore for my playersAlbum : https://imgur.com/a/Y9wfhjf

This is the journal of a lost king (Choral Rogarvia, an official character in Paizo's Golarion which I reused in my semi-homebrew campaign). 

It's 160 pages of content, with a lot of actual readable/decipherable text in various languages (there's a lot of ""fake scribbly text"" too), images, cyclopean runes (with actual meanings attached to each), puzzles, lore revelations, etc.. 

The text is written in a variety of languages, from Choral's native Iobarian to chelish, taldan, draconic and pre-darkness cyclopean. 
The languages are either my native French, or French/English ""translated"" through various online RPG translators (chaotic shiny, draconic translator, chosen of eilistraee...). 

This was gradually filled out over years as we played through my campaign, the idea being that most of the journal is ""magically locked"" and pages are only revealed if the locks are solved (usually with a password/word), which meant I could gradually decide what would be in it, keep my players guessing and wanting more, and it also meant they unlocked the pages non-chronologically and had to piece things together. 

I also gradually decided on a meaning for the various ""cyclopean runes"" in the book, I had a cyclopean numerical system (which I shamelessly stole from FEZ!), and slowly teased info about what happened to the king, his real story of the conquest, his troubles with devils, his romance with a powerful witch, his attempt at cheating the devil (the malebranche Alichino), his discovery of an ancient cyclopean place of immense power, his solution to getting inside and clues as to how the players might find him. 

For those who know Brevoy, Choral, the vanishing, etc.. You might kinda guess my interpretation of it (that exact 200 years mark between the conquest and the vanishing is mighty suspicious...), but I've only just taken what few things are known about Brevoy in the official world, and did my own weird things with it. 

It is probably the greatest puzzle (and the hardest/longest to make) I've ever done and I might never top this amount of effort for a single prop. It was a ton of fun, and I'm so proud of the result (even though some pages/drawings are kinda shitty).


I thought people might enjoy it, I know I would, i'm a sucker for weird grimoires.

I was thinking about playing it with some family at christmas dinner this year. They're in to games and interested in ttrpgs, it's a great intro to roleplaying (at least I feel like it is). They haven't played a lot of RPGs so I wanted to have three goals to a quest in my back pocket for the goblins to plan their ultimate christmas party. I was wondering us any of you smart people had some ideas for christmas themed heirlooms or personality quirks so I could put out a list in case anyone gets stumped trying to make their team. I had some in mind, but I'd love to hear what you think, if you had any quest/goal ideas that'd be awesome too. Its goblin quest, so no suggestion is too stupid or bizarre. Thanks in advance, you guys are always so great.

Quest: throw the ultimate goblin christmas party, for any of the goblins that survive.

Goals: 
Find and decorate a tree

Get presents

Get Santa there

Heirlooms:

Bag of never ending snowballs

String lights of repelling

Candy cane of grappling

Icicle of putting holes in things
Heavy club of slay bells

Sweater of hideousness that no one can quite look at you while wearing 

Quirks:

Affinity for reindeer

Ears that point straight up, like an elf's

Has had way too much eggnog

Has actually been run over by reindeer

rpg,t3_a6t0z2,"Help me craft catchy Title for pay RPG club for kids [serious]So I am thinking of starting RPG club for school kids 8-12yr olds (not for free).Now I am not going to run 5e D&amp;D. Surely not for younger ones. Possibly only for older kids if they insist. I am set on running ICRPG and Supers! Basically having superhero theme and kind of everything goes fantasy RPG for kids.

Now - The title should have D&amp;D in it. Or Dungeons and Dragons. Cause kids and parents mostly only associate roleplaying games under this name. But i would also want it to indicate we are not limited to D&amp;D. And also most important it must sound ""sane"" and ""not wierd"" for parents, while still being cool and interesting.

Your ideas ?

rpg,t3_a6ssu7,"Ability Costs 

So, I'm working on my own tabletop game and I'm making good headway but I'm at an impasse. My game features spells and whatnot, as it were, but I'm struggling to decide on how to price using them.

A big part of the game is that you ""Tier Up"" From Heoroic, to Ascended to Deific etc. As you tier up your abilities, as you imagine, do too.

Right now I can't decide between scaling up the spells automatically without altering the cost (Allowing people to use weaker version if they so choose)

Or having the costs increase by tier you decide to use it at. So a Tier 1 fire ball is 4 points, a tier 2 8 etc. Bearing in mind, you can only cast up to your tier.

The first seems alot simpler and allow for quicker play, with people only ever needing to remember the 1 cost it always is.

But the latter might alow more strategy I.E. using a weaker fireball to maintain more of your Mana/Spellpoints whatever have you against weaker foes.

I really want to lean towards ease of play, the less time in the book the better so you can move on with it. But I like letting people have those options. Ideas?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a6ssu7/ability_costs/,"[""If you have spells cost more, it gives you an additional knob to turn: mana rate. One player might maximize his mana flow ability, so he usually has enough mana to cast top-level spells; another might focus elsewhere, accepting that she will not be able to cast a high-level (and high-cost) spell every turn.\n\nOr, if mana burns down rather than building up, the one strategy gives the player a large pool for lots of powerful spells, while the other strategy - which should be competitive - is to accept a smaller pool, and have to choose carefully before casting an expensive spell, but to instead have a higher chance of success (or whatever it is you can buy with the points she *didn't* spend on increasing her mana supply).\n\nDoes that make sense?"", 'The second is only really appealing to me if I can push above my tier if I want, but it might leave me vulnerable later, or require extra hoops to jump through. Blowing all your mana on an extra big fireball at a dramatic moment is cool, contemplating if you need to pull your punches so you can play a war of attrition game with the GM is not so much. Basically consequences are fun when they are a result of you getting to do something cool. They are not fun when they are the result of doing what you are normally supposed to do.', ""I would go with the second one board games are a niche type genre as such having more control and customizability is better than streamlining everything.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, it's just my opinion.""]"

rpg,t3_a6s6d7,"Rolemaster zombie apocalypsesHey all I started running a rolemaster fantasy zombie apocalypse and it’s working well this far, we have elements of a survival game and elements that are still classic fantasy. 

The players have evolved as the sickness has spread and although they haven’t yet learned the cause they have figured out that their main protagonist in the story a female necromancer has gained the ability to control the dead and is using that ability to make a bid for status as a god.  

In my world gods are literally powered by followers and prayer if enough people worship you, you can become a god.. in a time of fear and death, this necromancer is well placed to get the following of the common people as she is one of only a few how can offer actual safety from the dead.  

She is not a god yet and still has a long way to go before getting that sort of power but it should become apparent to the players soon enough that surviving themselves isn’t enough.

rpg,t3_a6qxh6,"Space Combat - Mongoose Traveler 2e vs Stars Without a NumberI want to run a game that is basically Firefly meets Star Trek. I don't want the game to be focused on combat, but my players asked specifically for: 

1. When in their base starship, they want everybody to have something to do during space combat.
2. They want some dogfight action when using smaller vessels such as fighters. 

As I kinda don't have enough free time to read both, I would like some opinions from you guys who've read and played both games.

How each game deals with space combat? Which one would you say is a better fit for a Roll20-only group? Which one is easier to learn and which one is faster in play? Does the game make sure every player feels useful and have something meaningful to do during space combat? If you have played both of them, which one would you go back to for space combat alone?

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a6qxh6/space_combat_mongoose_traveler_2e_vs_stars/,"['I\'ll respond for Traveller, since the ONLY thing I ever use SWN for is the GM tools.\n\nDefined crew positions:\n\n* Pilot\n* Captain\n* Engineer\n* Senor operator (including electronic warfare)\n* Gunners (turret &amp; bay)\n* Marines (boarding &amp; repelling boarding)\n* Passengers (people without combat duty).\n\nShip combat rounds:\n\n* Maneuver - evasive actions, docking, lining up shots for gunners, etc\n* Attack - Weapons and boarding\n* Actions - Repairs, jump, launch craft, etc\n\nThe system itself is pretty abstract, with vectors and distance being the primary concerns. The system uses what\'s called ""range bands"" to track this. Most ship fights will take place far beyond visual range. Dogfights become possible at close range, but unless you\'re in a small (sub 100 ton) craft, you will suffer a significant penalty. Marines will usually conduct boarding actions by launching small craft designed for getting them in close.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all, I really like the system.

The system basically assigns every player a station, either through their character or a bridge crew NPC they then play for a bit; engineering, comms, weapons, etc, all using different skills and having different actions to perform. Those actions either produce or consume action points. \n\nThe biggest downside is that it's is not a very fast system, what with the team having to coordinate which actions to do in which order in order to get what they want. It's better suited for combats that only last a handful of rounds. Then again, that's basically the case for almost every combat system in any game, I feel. Even combat in D&amp;D becomes a slog if it lasts more than 10 turns. But if you do combat often enough people should master the system well enough as everyone has a set list of actions they can do anyway. That lessens the learning curve, and as such the system isn't overly complex anyway so that helps as well with learning it. \n\nWhat I like about it is how flavourful and cinematic it is and that it feels more like a tactical way of doing combat. It's worth the downsides, I feel.""]"

Making a list of tropes and concepts that define the setting for the players to have.', ""Games I run typically use published RPG settings used with different rulesets than their original ones or other established fictional settings with rulesets chosen to fit them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think the crucial point is identifying what themes of given setting are interesting to you and your players. What you want to explore, what kind of stories you want to tell? Sometimes, this flows clearly from the setting itself or the works of fiction that establish it. In other cases, the setting is broad enough that you first need to decide what do you want to do with it.\n\nThen you can select a system that fits the play style you aim for. Don't try to simulate all setting-specific matters in detail, but choose and customize the ruleset to support the themes you selected during the first step. Want a game with a lot of action and risk taking? Choose a system where this style of play will be rewarded, not punished. Select a different ruleset for a heist game when you want players to spend most of the session planning and a different one if you want to get to action immediately and then show the preparations in flashbacks. Decide if your war game needs mechanics for small unit tactics or for emotional and moral degradation.\n\nThird step is creating characters with goals and bonds that will shape the campaign. If players were involved in the previous steps, they'll probably focus on addressing the campaign themes by themselves - but it's better to always make sure that the characters fit together and fit the intended play style.\n\nThen you just throw the characters into a charged situation that engages their flags (goals, beliefs, motivations etc.) and the story starts rolling by itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to change some (not obvious) things in an established setting, tell the players. You don't need to tell what exactly you're changing, but you should gain their approval, so it doesn't feel like a bait and switch. For example, my wife ran a great Mistborn campaign this way.

rpg,t3_a6qbtu,"Dealing with excessive amounts of evil player charactersI don't really know if this fits here in r/rpg, but I can't find a better reddit to post in.

I've been having a hard time recently in my roleplay community. My character is a ""Stupid Good"" character, and while she's made a lot of progress toward being an actual decent person, it feels like everything I've done with her is about to be wasted because all of a sudden almost everyone in the community is playing an evil character. I don't know why this is suddenly happening, but at this point my character is likely to be robbed, beaten, and killed, assuming that nothing worse happens. Even the few people left who don't roleplay explicitly criminal characters tend to side with a character who dislikes my character, because he socially gaslights her in the eyes of everyone else and makes them think she's crazy.

I'm not sure if I should just abandon the community for however many months it takes for things to stop being so filled with criminals, or what. My character can easily win a direct fight with most people, but since they're all criminals none of them actually do direct fights. Instead they just do stuff like tracking my character to her home and preparing to call an entire criminal faction to raid it. The only reason my character has lasted this long is that she's strong enough to outright kill pretty much anyone that attacks her.

Pretty much the only thing I can think of to do right now would be to metagame and kill everyone that I OOCly know is a criminal, but I won't do that on principle, even if I could think of a way to do it without being caught. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do though, aside from just going into hiding for months. What would you suggest I do at this point?

EDIT: Just to be extra clear, this is a roleplaying community with upwards of 30 people, not a small table playing D&amp;D (we have a D&amp;D based system though). I can't find any better subreddits, and a lot of the people here have useful enough insights that I thought I would ask even if my question isn't the best fit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a6qbtu/dealing_with_excessive_amounts_of_evil_player/,"['If you no longer fit in with your group, and you are not having fun, it is ok to stop, or take some tune away.

', 'Well, while it sounds like your doing something a little different than tabletop, I\'ve had experience with something like this. \n\nPart of the problem, it seems, is the people hosting this game are part of the community that wants to be sneaky stabby types. With community roleplay like this, those who run the game will have the greatest influence over the flavor. Even if it seems they have no direct control, they\'re going to have a subtle impact that can steamroll the desires of anyone who disagrees or opposes their roleplay. Often they aren\'t even aware of it.\n\nOne community I was a part of many years ago had several factions. Drow, an enclave of thieves and assassins, orcs and dwarves, worshipers of a love goddess, and even something resembling Warhammer\'s Chaos faction. I was part of the lawful worshipers of a god of justice, because I preferred being a goody two shoes at the time, and I was friends with some of the members of that community.\n\nThe problem was, that while each community had at least one member of the ""staff"" as we called them, our community did not because that staff member had quit. So, for the better part of a year and a half, we operated with whichever staff member could offer us a little RP attention. This was needed, because we worshiped a god.\n\nHere\'s where the staff\'s influence caused problems. A majority of the older staff members were big fans of the thief and assassin\'s religion, and all had characters in there. Their god got involved in every single thing they did, because multiple members of the staff played that god. In effect, they had supreme narrative control over every single major event. Because they were sneaky stabby types, they never behaved cooperatively with any other group in the game. They were effectively a private club who robbed, killed, and hung out with each other when they weren\'t scamming others.\n\nMeanwhile, in the year and a half I was part of my community, I saw two instances of our God\'s influence. This was because the entire staff collectively declared that our god was actually dead, since that staff member had quit. This meant that most of the time, we were openly mocked by the entire playerbase for worshiping a dead god. Eventually they did correct this, by introducing a new child god, who went on to make terrible errors in judgement and ultimately lead to the destruction of the world.\n\nThe point is, at no point was any of this fun, except moments when we were left alone to just have our own private roleplaying. This resulted in a feud with almost every other community, and many of our members began taking a ""Take no prisoners."" attitude with anyone who even hinted at being slightly evil. Those of us who didn\'t agree with that, which was not a small number, were left feeling ostracized by our own people for all the somewhat innocent characters that were attacked for not immediately treating our ""holy order"" as the ultimate authority.\n\nEverything spiraled out of control eventually, causing the entire game to die. All because staff ended up taking a side.\n\nSo I\'m going to suggest what worked out for me and those of my group that I still enjoyed talking to. We left. We found another roleplaying group with an entirely different lore, and created new characters that were part of that world. It worked out well, and we had a much better time. Ironically we left about two weeks before everything hit the fan in the other ""world"".\n\nSometimes, the best solution is to just walk away, especially if the winds are blowing directly against your character\'s concept. Trying to get a group of people who view you as the ""opposition"" to accept that they might lose some of the time is just not a winning scenario.

At that point, I suggest negotiating a truce (your character gets to live in some peaceful spot on the world so you can reprise her role at a later date when things calm down) or you stop playing with them and bring your character sheet home with you because they\'re obviously jerks and jerks aren\'t fun to play with in the first place. :3\n\nThen, maybe you can recruit a few, nice players from this game and organize one for yourselves, a spin-off or jist another world entirely! :3\n\nI hope this helped!', 'Excellent!

rpg,t3_a6pd0q,"First time Game Master and First Time Players, any tips?I'm running a game for three of my friends, and I've been a GM one other time, and I was running a game for my dad, who's been gaming since first edition D&amp;D. I've been playing since I was 9 years old (I'm 15 now), but my players needed an explaination about what an RPG is. I've got an idea for what we're going to do in our first session, as well as their pregenerated characters, but I just wanted to know if anyone here has any tips for running a game. Thank you in advanced!
Some important things to know:
1. We are using Gurps 4e, a system that I am extremely familiar with
2. Me and my group are all 15 year old girls
3. No one in the group has ever played a tabletop rpg
4. We are using a D&amp;D style fantasy setting",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a6pd0q/first_time_game_master_and_first_time_players_any/,"['Keep it simple and keep it flowing. If there\'s any confusion about a rule, spend no more than 1 minute looking it up. If you can\'t find the answer in that time say ""Ok, here\'s how we\'ll do it this time &lt;insert simple, arbitrary but fair judgement here&gt; but I\'ll look up the proper rule for next time""\n\nMake it clear that this is a temporary call to keep things going. When you do find the proper rule, you may find that your call was better.', 'Good tools are ""yes and"" and ""no, but"". Have failure throw them into more perilous situations instead of just being a lack of success (think Indiana Jones). Encourage them to ask questions about the world and characters.

Do you have some sort of puzzle/problem/obstacle, and your players have has an actual discussion on how to solve it, feel like they're being smart, and it is absolutely the wrong way to solve it? Turns out it's the right way to solve it, good job team. Reward your players for teamwork, effort, and trying to advance the story; don't punish them because they didn't visualize or correctly interpret the situation you were trying to get across to them.\n\nSame goes for pursuing leads in the story. It's not awful to tell someone the place they went to didn't help, but keep in mind that your players can't see 99% of the world.

I've found little more satisfying as a player than boosting up another one. Some important NPC knows you? Make sure to introduce (and talk up) your fellow players. Are you the best at combat? Use that to set prowess to trip up your opponents and line the kill up for your friend (preferably the second-best combatant,as they likely spent a good deal of their points on something and they ended up getting overshadowed). \n\nAs well: I've long held that the hallmark of a good roleplayer is the willingness to make a suboptimal choice because it's what the character would do. Give an unimportant NPC some of your much-needed money even though you don't think you'll ever see them again. Try to take your enemies alive, if you're not truly a killer. Put your faith in an NPC it would be safer just to kill.

rpg,t3_a6p4ec,"Who invented the ""Asking questions"" GMing style?In recent actual play videos you often find the GM sharing the load of world building with the players by asking a lot of questions. Like about the characters background, the characters bonds, deities or foreign places in the game world. The advantage is obvious. It saves the GM from a lot of creative work, and it also enhances the players investment into the game.

For examples of what I'm asking for, you might want to have a look at these: 

[An Evening with Dungeon World](https://youtu.be/9UGme0TVMCE?t=540)

[Wil Wheaton Plays FATE CORE](https://youtu.be/NOFXtAHg7vU)

Systems like *Dungeon World* (and I suppose all PbtA games), but also, if less obvious, *Fate* codify this GMing style in their rules, but there should be no reason why a GM couldn't use the same approach in any other system.

So do you know when this GMing style was first conceived, and by whom? 

Would you know a proper term to refer to this particular style of GMing?

[Here's](http://adept-press.com/wordpress/wp-content/media/Understanding_The_Pool.pdf) an essay by Ron Edwards about it (the introduction might be the most interesting thing to you, as it name-drops a bunch of old games that were pushing the boundaries in the late 90s/early 00s).\n\nFinding the first GM to ever hand narrative control over to their players by asking questions is probably impossible.

This establish a meta-level of the narration, generating hilarious moments in and oht of character. Note that I\'m running the same campaign for two groups (the first one near the end, the second in the middle).\n\nMy campaign is based on Tarots: each session relies on a Major Arcana. So far they have collected 20 of 21, waiting only for the last one, The World. They can actually grab the last one whenever they want to return to the real world: it is possessed by the Guardian (which is mine PC/GMPC), who is a tarot readers that makes a card divination at the start of each session. Therefore I spoil each session with the tarots: sometime they actuallg guess the outcomes (""urh, the Magician *must* be a magic user!), but usually they have the ""eureka"" moment only after the conclusion of the session (""oooh, Temperance meant to not have sex with the werewolf girl!"").\n\nThe entire campaign was a set up for the players to free an ancient, evil god of vengeance trapped in a fountain-statue, the Mascherone (Big Mask), also known as Ba\'al, an Entity of Darkness which was trying to achieve the same power as the Lord With No Time (the christian God, which is above entities of light and darkness, aka the pagan/roman gods) and the Lord With No Space (an eldritch ""thing"" that manipulates the void, being able o erase into non-existance entire cities, or send them into other dimensions), becoming impervious to both weapons and magics. \n\nThrough a series of shenanigans, Ba\'al tricks the player to free him (XV: The Devil) and recalls his servants: Timat, a trickster cat-like entity of darkness, and Eshnut/Bufo, a frog-like entity of light, the patreon of one of my player (a pagan priest/summoner of light, and, in part, darkness, and recently aquired a way to summon the eldritch Lord With No Space). Having both light and darkness, he destroys the Sacra of Saint Michael (XVI: The Tower) in which is hidden the only weapon (""Morning Star"") able to wound him. Knowing well that the heroes will save themselves and retrieve the sword (XVII: The Star, this needed a trip to the Purgatory with the abbot of the Sacra, and receiving the weapon from the Archangel himself, who warns them to not turn themselves until ""out of this realm"", a reference to the myth of Orfeo), he sends Timat to stop them.\n\nTimat casts a perpetual night (XVIII: The Moon, water, ghosts, illusions, dream), an illusion with *the moon itself slowly falling onto the players\' city*, and a series of enemies: lesser demons and devil, werewolves, Silver Noses (the elite of Ba\'al army, human who offered their soul to him to grant them revenge against their enemies, and are now able to share the damage they receive to the attacker), and last but not lease, Nightmares. Nightmares are shades that eat the fear of mortals, and are able to change themselves into what causes the most fear (the first edition of this game is 1984, way before JK Rowling).\n\nThey remained shadows, but speak to them about the game itself. ""You are trapped in the cruel machinations of your so called friend, or Ludi Magister (Game Master), or Guardian, a perpetual illusion from a sadistic god. You are bound to fail: each action you took lead to despair. You brought the Green Plague which killed half of the city (and the Master called it a good ending), then Ba\'al led you to a quest to find the cure, only to the citizien of the city to worship him, allowing him to resurrect, and then  he destroyed the Sacra and almost killed you, and now you, four, alone, are going against him. Will you win? No, of course. Win Ba\'al and you will have even more dangerous opponents. The more you avance in this madness, the more you will stripped of any power on your fate. You (*and called the players name*) are nothing but puppets of him! Saint-Michael offered you to stay in the Eden above the Purgatory. Why do you continue this meaningless game?""\n\nThe answer was epic ""We do it for the loot"".\n\nThe Nightmares laughed and went away, and the players reached Timat. She didn\'t want to fight them, and proposed a deal: she will remove the perpetual night and the heroes will kill Ba\'al, freeing her from his control. They agree with the trickster.\n\nShe removes the night, but not the illusion. The heroes fight Illusion!Ba\'al (XIX: The Sun, but the card is upside down) and he uses Eshnut (the priester patreon) as a meat shield: the attacking player decide to not stop the blow, and the poor froggy is turned to dust. Then they fight Illusion!Ba\'al, ""killing"" him (I WILL RETURN, FOR YOU STARTED THE CYCLE OF VENGEANCE!) after an hard battle (but not really a boss-level hard battle).\n\nIt\'s in the next session (XX: Judgement) that they wander into the native city of a character of the other group, finding that they have finished in the other group campaign! They have to use the power of the Lod With No Space to erase the city itself (thus starting the backstory of the other character) and return to their campaign, with the session XXI: The World. \n\nUpon entering the ""Door of Level"" (the passage to other dimensions, and the real world), the Guardian reveal them that they can return back in time up to 12 times (they have 12 ""Fate Point"" to use to return to up to 12 sessions) to change the past (for example, prevent the Green Plague,.or the resurrection of Ba\'al, or the destruction of the Sacra, or the death of Eshnut/Bufo, and so on...), or take the last Major Arcana and return to the real world.\n\nThe players are now pondering what to do. One of them is satisfied (the one who took a nasty form of lycanthrophy as STD), one is unalaigned and two of them want to reset the past. They now have to decide which session try to alter: they were advised that some ""powerful creatures"" (like Ba\'al) are going to remember the pasts/futures, and act accordingly, while others ""weaker"" will forget.\n\nAnd here is the catch. Why only 12 points if the Major Arcana are 21? Because they actually have used them in the past, when they were weaker (thus forgot) thus condamning themselves and the entire world to the cycle. Ba\'al has arranged a complex level of shenanigans to be freed in every cycle (he can be freed in 4 different ways), to always trap the heroes into the illusion and therefore allowing him to exist: he is conscious that, when the player will stop playing, he will cease to exists and then be forgot.\n\nThat\'s what the Nightmares were saying. The sadistic god is both me as Master and Timat as the one who perpetuates the illusion (from the latin *in lusio* in game). In XVIII the Moon, to stop the illusion, the players will have to kill Timat:\n- They have to refuse her offer\n- She will multiply into *six* copies of herself, and start pulling down the Illusion!Moon to kill the characters.\n- The Moon will then be stopped by an Entity of Light, Xur the Elder (that he priest is able to summon), able to alter time, providentially appeared behind the players (""Don\'t turn your back"" said the Archangel), and then he will freeze time to allow the character to kill the six copies.\n- Xur is the seventh copy (because in Italy is said that cats have secen lives) of Timat. If the players don\'t kill him/her, the illusion continues.\n\nIf they manage to destroy all the seven copies, Timat thanks them and dies, destroying the illusion. Now they can actually fight Ba\'al (XIX the Sun) and save Eshnut (XX the Judgement) even if used as defence by Ba\'al. In fact, the true XX Judgement brings the character to an ancient palace where Eshnut was initially (centuries before) summoned by a young boy (the first summoner of his village), condamned to death for whitchcraft, and whose father\'s anger, frustration and hate changed him into a Silver Nose and awakened Ba\'al and the complex plan that lead the whole story to motion.\n\nTL;DR: An evil god and a trickster goddess arrange to successfully keep the players playing. A poor frog is involved. Trying to destroy the rock prison of a demon god is not a good idea.\n', ""I don't necessarily want them to catch on yet but I have been dropping clues and foreshadowing that my players are carrying the final boss of the campaign around.

Congrats are given, XP is earned, loot is gained, good fun.\n\nBut then, the party finds itself stuck in front of the door the Mana Golem was guarding. The door is covered in a strange magical field, and touching it, even for a second, results in a painful zap, blasting us away. So, we start thinking ""Maybe the door\'s enchanted to only open for certain creatures or objects"", and so we start everything we can think of: Pushing the door with the broken gauntlets of the Golem, pressing shards of the mana gem against the door, looking for hidden runes ... We just can\'t figure it out.\n\nAnd during those 10, 15 minutes IRL that we spent debating, arguing and imagining a solution, I see my brother with this look of *utter despair* behind the screen. Eventually, I think he just lost patience and said ""Dumbfounded and unable to find the solution, you all step back, trying to figure this mystery out. u/Yrusul, exhausted, sits on his *bag*, which is *heavy* from the weight of the *magical bomb* he picked up minutes ago. *The bomb*.

rpg,t3_a6lj8f,"Lich PatronsI am working on book on liches - it's an update to one I wrote for 3.5. Below is a section from the book on lich patrons. I am seeking feedback. 

Also, I will not be posting anything else from the book for a week or so, as I edit the text and work on adapting the mechanics.  

 \- -

## Patrons

*“I’ve got so much power to give you, Swann. All you have to do is beg.”*  
 \-Nix, *Lord of Illusions*

Would-be liches must learn the lichdom ritual somewhere. One possibility is that the would-be Sorrow Lord reaches an arrangement with a patron entity. The patron supplies the ritual, and dark power, to the would-be lich. The lich may supply captured souls to the patron entity in return. This works like a person taking a loan from a loan shark. This person is motivated to repay to loan but is not working for the loan shark per se. Sometimes, arcane spell casters with a religious devotion take their obsession’s subject as their patron. This later option is common among lay devotees. By comparison, clerics who seek undeath as a proof of piety usually become mummies.

Patrons often attempt to seduce a spell caster them into embracing lichdom. This occurs across a lifetime of chances for decency the patron corrodes while presenting opportunities for power to the spell caster. Power the spell caster may apply to those problems. Problems that the patron secretly created. Further, a patron may support a target’s autodidact tendencies with reading material guaranteed to be interesting. All these offers – the power, the books, etc. – come with hidden costs. Different types of patrons attract different types of spell casters. Liches with a patron will gain access to a prestige class (or template). They may further acquire an additional creature type, in addition to undead, relating to their patron. Please refer to Chapter Five For more on the prestige classes (or templates). 

A patron’s arrangement is not always open-ended; i.e. it does not simply require an endless supply of souls. Sometimes they offer the deal if the lich will craft them an artifact, destroy the patron’s rival, or otherwise further the patron’s goals. This table provides some random options for a deal between a lich and a patron.

  

**Patron Deal**

**d20       Results**

1          Develop and provide new spells, and magic items, on a consistent basis. 

2           Strip all the color from creation. 

3           Conquer the world.

4           Murder all other arcane magic users. 

5             Murder a god. 

6-15        Collect souls for the patron, and the lich may pursue its own goals.

16           Build an artifact for the patron, with a due date of 200 years from the time of transformation.

17            Assassinate a major rival to the patron, or remove a major obstacle to the patron, such as a solar angel tutelary spirit, with a due date of 100 years from the time of   transformation.

18            Destroy an empire  with a due date of 300 years from the time   of transformation.

rpg,t3_a6kuta,"Wanting to start a world-exploration campaign in the Wheel of Time universe. Suggestions on game systems?TLDR I want a narrative, roleplaying system with a light combat system to run a Wheel of Time themed campaign. Preferrably more sandbox game than a super railroaded campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

I've read The Wheel of Time series 5+ times and I love the world. I've also been playing D&amp;D since I was \~10 years old and tried a few different systems. My brother and I even designed our own system. As a player,  I love world exploration most, and just experiencing the world that you're being a part of. 

  
What I want is a system that is focused on roleplaying and exploration, but that has a simple combat system to go with it that is still tactical with a map.  I would also like a system for magic, like in WOT, that is representative, but not restrictive in what you can do with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of doing something like Fate, but with a slightly more robust combat system underneath it, or maybe Savage Worlds adapted to Wheel of Time, focusing more on the roleplaying, exploration, and social encounters than the combat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on RPG systems that would work for this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a6kuta/wanting_to_start_a_worldexploration_campaign_in/,"['On the WoT subreddit was a discussion about it a month ago about WoT DnD.

Let everyone compel and tempt in order to make the Bennies flow.

It\'s also probably the most prolific. It\'s often joked that every inch of Faerûn has been covered with a fine toothed comb and it\'s not too much of an exaggeration.

As far as adventure paths though, while not unprecedented\\* APs as we know them were really a concept innovated by Paizo in the pages of Dungeon magazine when they published it in the 3.0-3.5 era, during which time Greyhawk was the official setting and thus the one the adventure paths were set in.

So over the summer I made [Golaith](https://github.com/rj60001/Goliath) (and a complementary quest that is not yet typed up) game. Its aimed at getting your friends who are not so into RPG to play a game or two. This is because it has a simple, easy to follow rule-set, which is at the above link.

It is set in a giant fantasy city called *Goliath*, filled with magic, warriors, thieves and so much more. Main features include:

* Simple, easy to pick up rules.
* A replaced ""class"" system to create an infinite set of character roles.
* Flexible for the DM
* Can last from an evening adventure to a multiple month journey.
* A variety of interesting races

This is my first attempt at a game and I would really like to improve it if I have the time, so if you could please have a go and leave me any and all feedback. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a6j6hn/goliath_a_simple_flexible_game_6_pages_of_rules/,

rpg,t3_a6hlej,"Why are ""chaotic neutral"" characters so bafflingly popular?I've played at almost a dozen different tables over the past year - I moved, and I'm trying to find a new group - and while they all had their own quirks and foibles, one thing really stuck out to me. A full third of the characters played at these tables were basically the sort of ""chaotic neutral"" do-anything-I-want stereotypes that I see people complain about online all the time. As a player myself, I really don't understand the appeal. As far as I can tell, they have a few defining characteristics:

1. **No meaningful bonds to other people.** They're orphans with few friends who rob their allies blind for a laugh. As such, it's very difficult to get them invested in any plots that don't revolve around their own wackiness.
2. **No governing ideology or sense of morality...** Obviously, this comes with the territory, but it involves a lot of wanton murder and thievery, often for no purpose other than their own amusement.
3. **...other than making their party-mates miserable and breaking any sense of immersion.** Seriously, why would my character travel with a Rogue that tries to rob them every night, who pickpockets the quest-giver and gets caught?

To me, this sounds incredibly boring from a player perspective. Am I just being thick, or is there a way to play this sort of character that isn't so obnoxious? And why are they so damn popular?

EDIT: Oh, and for the record, I've banished traditional alignment from the games I run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a6hlej/why_are_chaotic_neutral_characters_so_bafflingly/,"['The main reason is that people use chaotic neutral as ""protection from consequences,"" both in terms of game mechanics and role-playing.\n\nThere are a lot of things in the game that can specifically target or impede you if you\'re good or evil, but there isn\'t a lot of stuff that cares if you\'re some flavor of neutral. Spells, artifacts, creature powers... it\'s all rigged to punish very good or very evil characters.\n\nAnd when it comes to role-playing, most players think chaotic neutral means, ""I can do whatever I want whenever I want."" Maybe that kind of character is fun for a while, but as a DM, it\'s really fucking boring to have characters like that in the game.\n\nSo, if I had to pin down one thing as being responsible for the proliferation of chaotic neutral characters, it would be: fear. Players are afraid of game systems that might target them for being good or evil. They\'re afraid of having to stick to a personality or backstory. They\'re afraid of the other players questioning their actions or motives. It\'s pure fear that steers people toward chaotic neutral.', 'CN has a nasty, nasty, awful nasty stigma because disruptive jackasses use it as a thin justification to embrace and live out all their sociopathic urges in the form of ""LOL so randumb"" murder-hobo bullshit, as if ""what my alignment says I have to do"" and ""I\'m a PC, that means I\'m special"" elevates their behavior above consequences.\n\n(As an aside, similar can be said for the alignment system in general.  Rigid literalists ruined what otherwise added some flavor to D&amp;D via \'affinity for / susceptibility to specific magical energies, which further manifested as these personality traits\' by insisting on things like \'lol so randumb\' and \'lawful stupid\')\n\nCN can be a fun alignment...the kind of person who has vigilante tendencies, who takes matters into their own hands and won\'t hesitate to sidestep the system the moment the system is wrong or gets in the way...but also the kind of person who doesn\'t have delusions of grandeur or ambitions of being a savior.  Your 3 bullet points describe not just *Chaotic Evil*, but a particularly extreme version thereof, as even a typical CE character recognizes the value of useful allies.  From where I sit (and I understand this is a more modern take than 1E/etc), a CN Character:\n\n1. **Does not concern themselves with \'tradition\'...**: Chaotic characters place little to no value on ""It\'s always been this way"", or other forms of structure for the sake of structure, especially when it\'s ineffective or inefficient.  Rules are guidelines; one has to be prepared to make exceptions...and to remove rules that outlive their usefulness.\n2. **...but that doesn\'t mean they\'re honorless:** Chaotic does not mean \'unreliable\', it means \'restless\'.  A chaotic character is not content to remain static or \'be a townie\', whether that takes the form of thrill-seeking, wanderlust, insatiable curiosity, or anything else that could be described as \'change for the sake of change\'.\n3. **Is more concerned with \'just\' than \'legal\'...:** Chaotic characters will not follow an unjust or evil law just because it\'s the law.\n4. **...but are not content with civil disobedience or malicious compliance:**  Chaotic characters will not stop at merely \'not following an unjust law\'...they will do everything from protest to actively subvert \'the system\' to effect change.\n5. **Will not sacrifice for a total stranger...:** Neutral (good/evil axis) characters are not paragons of altruism...\n6. **...but have no qualms about doing so for someone they know:** ...but aren\'t particularly selfish, either.  They aren\'t heartless or cruel, and most of the time they\'ll lean good because a community is easier to live with than a bunch of sociopaths.  Their altruism takes the form of accepting that they can\'t save everyone, and so put their focus on \'their community\', whether that\'s a neighborhood or a group of friends.\n\nIn earlier editions (5th walked this back considerably), it also meant that the character had an affinity for entropic energies, but no affinity for either positive/life (good) or negative/unlife (evil) energies, as the magical energies of order, entropy, life, and unlife are (were) fundamental forces of the universe no different than heat, magnetism, or gravity.', ""It's easy and a lazy way to create a character, generally. Players who don't want to build a story with other people, but just want to fuck around. They don't want to invest anything in the game and get to torment people who do.\n\nNot every CN character is like that, clearly. But it's something that shows up across various games, too- see FishMalks in Vampire. But it's basically the tabletop equivalent of a troll. "", 'Gets under my skin that default CN is insanity rather than being Han Solo. CN would logically be the most common adventurer alignment not some weird abberation.', 'The only CN archetype I like is the abolitionist. ', '&gt;but it involves a lot of wanton murder and thievery\n\nThat would be chaotic evil. \n\nA lot of the reason people role play is to get to do things that they can\'t do in real life. \n\nAnd in real life, they have to respect a ton of rules, follow social conventions, kowtow to conventional morality (as opposed to the basic ""don\'t be evil"" that everyone reasonable can agree on). \n\nWho wants to do those things when role playing to get away from their mundane and constrained life?', 'Many players simply think it\'s a license to have their characters either act like duchebags or do whatever they want with impunity, because it\'s ""in character"", even though that\'s not at all what Chaotic Neutral represents, nor has it ever officially been presented this way.\n\nAs a GM, I\'ve regularly adjusted the alignments of such characters into the Evil spectrum. Evil means almost always thinking about one\'s self or how one\'s actions might benefit themselves, even at the detriment of others. Well, there are few things more selfish in this world or any other than thinking you can do anything without consequence or recompense.', 'In short? Because people want to play evil characters, without actually calling them as such and GMs let them get away with bad behavior.\n\nEdit: Reddit silver? Thank you, kind stranger.', ""Primarily because alignment is a silly relic and people often want to play adventuresome rapscallions who aren't tied down by the strictures of society.\n\nSecondly, because stereotypes like this are perpetuated to new players and DMs don't do a good enough job of enforcing consequences.\n\nThirdly, your listed characteristics are sweeping generalizations.\n\nFourthsome: Look at the great grand-daddies of fantasy adventure (Fafhrd and Mouser, Conan, Bilbo) - none of them got anywhere playing by other people's rules."", 'I have literally read the book definitions out to GMs before only to get back blank looks and murmured versions of ""Well that\'s not how I think of it.""\n\n~90% of GMs have never really read and comprehended the alignment system. They feel it\'s just something they know. They\'ve come in with deep preconceptions about good and evil, and they prefer those personal feelings over what the book has within it. The alignment system isn\'t really that complicated, but it ends up being such shit in practice because its trying to override a GMs moral conception of the world and how (s)he sees it.\n\nSo I generally lean towards chaotic or true neutral alignments. Not for any character reasons, but because generally with those alignments, I don\'t have to deal with the shit GM\'s moral ditherings.  It\'s side-stepping the mechanic, because a GM can\'t really successfully modify a system he doesn\'t understand, and I\'m not psychic enough to know his soul\'s desire. \n\nFor the love of god, please just sit down, read the section, and try comprehend that it\'s trying to convey the definition of good/evil in the _base D&amp;D world_, not your own. Once you get its position, then you can write a better version on your own if you want.', 'Speaking just for myself, when I was just starting to play D&amp;D ages ago, I had a strong tendency to play Chaotic Neutral characters as a defense mechanism because I felt vulnerable trying to genuinely participate in role-playing.\n\nIt\'s only clear to me in hindsight, decades later, what it meant when I would make a ""real"" character in private -- with personality, ambitions, inner struggles, ideals they\'d fight for -- and then when I got to the table, say that I forgot to make a character and quickly roll up some lolrandum two-dimensional rogue sociopath. I\'m sure no one will be surprised to hear this was in my teenage years.\n\nComing out of my shell was a process, but it wouldn\'t have happened without the unrelenting bravery of those members of my gaming groups who participated openly and deeply. That made it okay, made it normal. And it especially helped that every campaign started from scratch, since every new character was an opportunity for a meaningful shift in how I\'d play them; it didn\'t draw attention the way it would if my yet-another-CN-halfling-rogue started caring about things.\n\nIt really sucks that _caring about stuff_ is often uncool, but what really helped me get over it was having good role-models who openly cared about stuff and showed that it was accepted, normal, even laudable.\n\n**tl;dr:** Help make it cool to care about stuff. :)', 'As a different take on a Chaotic Neutral character, my current warlock is one. He\'s convinced his soul is damned when he dies- he\'s right about that- so he\'s primarily hedonistic and selfish. But rather than a ""I\'ll do whatever I want"" randomness, he\'s manipulative. He\'s got the best character bonds in the party, because I know exactly what value each of the other pcs has to him, what they bring to his life, and how he works with them. He\'s kind of the worst devil\'s advocate ever, but he\'s got his own system that he works with, and it\'s important to him.\n\nIf course, this was all worked out because I\'ve been playing with this group for years, so I know them and what will work and what we\'ll instinctively do to play off each other, so that helps. ', 'From AD&amp;D 1st Edition\'s Player\'s Handbook:\n&gt; **Chaotic Neutral:** Above respect for life and good, or disregard for life and promotion of evil, the chaotic neutral places randomness and disorder. Good and evil are complimentary balance arms. Neither are preferred, nor must either prevail, for ultimate chaos would then suffer.\n\nFrom AD&amp;D 2nd Edition\'s Player\'s Handbook:  \n&gt; **Chaotic Neutral:** Chaotic neutral characters believe that there is no order to anything, including their own actions. With this as a guiding principle, they tend to follow whatever whim strikes them at the moment. Good and evil are irrelevant when making a decision. Chaotic neutral characters are extremely difficult to deal with. Such characters have been known to cheerfully and for no apparent purpose gamble away everything they have on the roll of a single die.  \nThey are almost totally unreliable. In fact, the only reliable thing about them is that they cannot be relied upon! This alignment is perhaps the most difficult to play. Lunatics and madmen tend toward chaotic neutral behavior.  \n\nFrom D&amp;D 3rd Edition\'s Player\'s Handbook:  \n&gt; *Chaotic Neutral, ""Free Spirit"":* A chaotic neutral character follows his whims. He is an individualist first and last. He values his own liberty but doesn\'t strive to protect others\' freedom. He avoids authority, resents restrictions, and challenges traditions. A chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy. To do so, he would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from himself suffer). A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but his behavior is not totally random. He is not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it. Gimble, a bard who wanders the land living by his wits, is chaotic neutral. Chaotic neutral is the best alignment you can be because it represents true freedom from both society\'s restrictions and a do-gooder\'s zeal.\n\nD&amp;D 4th Edition changed the alignments system, shifting to a system of five (Good, Lawful Good, Evil, Chaotic Evil, Unaligned), with the latter being the old ""True Neutral"".  \n\nFrom D&amp;D 5th Edition\'s Player\'s Handbook:  \n&gt; **Chaotic neutral (CN)** creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.  \n\nSo, the ""official"" definition for Chaotic Neutral shifted around a bit, along the editions, with the only constant being ""a chaotic neutral values his own freedom above all else"".  \n1st Edition started shaping the murder-hobo with the ""places randomness and disorder above all else.""  \n2nd Edition followed suit with its ""Lunatics and madmen tend towards chaotic neutral behavior.""  \n\nWith all its faults (imho), 3rd Edition nailed it more than the others, but closed it really badly with that ""is the best.""  \n\n4th Edition just said ""fuck it!""  \n\n5th Edition seems to have taken the first step towards not giving much shit about alignments.', ""It's just a low effort cop out..  \n\n\nOR  \n\n\nIf people actually able to role play it's a way to break free of the constraints of a fixed alignment and actually behave like a normal human."", ""That's chaotic neutral done badly.

But sometimes, I find that the best methods in accomplishing the party's goals are some truly reprehensible acts. I don't like to torture others, but this sneaky asshole from the cult we're trying to infiltrate just broke into my room and tried to steal the very secret artifact we need in order to stop them. I'm gonna need some answers, and being a goody two shoes isn't going to get them. \n\nBasically, I just like the freedom to act how I want to, without moral standards I'm forced to adhere to. \n\nFor instance, my current character is a CN Cleric of Talos. I've befriended a handful of NPCs, saved a ton of people without any promise of reward, helped rebuild a town after a force of barbarians tried to tear it down just because it was a beautiful city and the people there were nice. Yet Talos is considered an Evil God of destruction and chaos. I follow him because he saved me from a terrible life. I owe him everything. So whenever I come across a shrine to some other entity, I destroy it in his name. I'm maybe a little aggressive in combat and have maybe chosen a few fights that I could have walked away from, but nobody is missing them anyway. Who cares if I convince the party to massacre a bunch of troglodytes? They're just troglodytes. And I wanted their magic sword. And they were killing each other anyway. It's not like I've murdered innocents or stolen from my party members or whatever. The dragonborn can be a real bitch, but she's still my friend and I'm happy to travel with her. I haven't even burned down any real churches yet.\n\nEdit: that kind of got away from me a bit at the end there... point is, I play CN for true freedom, but would never use it as an excuse to fuck with the party or our mission. If anything, it's just an excuse to accomplish our goals by whatever means necessary. Sometimes, you need someone in the party who will do the things that need to be done but nobody else has the constitution to pull off.

Yes. Seriously. \n\nIf you set your game up with colorful NPC characters who have different motivations/ intents and aren't colored by some mindless ally/ enemy extremes, generally your players will debate the nuances, who is on their side, who isn't.  An ally in one situation might be an enemy in another. Give NPC's a goal or purpose, which they may or may not be upfront about. \n\nIf you do it well, you can split the party on their intentions, i.e. two different people trying to do opposite things for good reasons. That's where the PC/ PC conversations start. "", ""With great effort and giving the players situations that give them a reason to talk to one another.\n\nIt's obvious: if the party just narrowly swerved around a drunkard that threw a bottle at their speeding car, they are probably going to be outraged. They might even get out of the car to beat that guy to mush.\n\nBut they are going to say something to one another: make sure it's in-character."", 'The biggest issue in games with little PC to PC communication that I\'ve noticed is the way the game is being played.\n\nAs a seldom player, always Game Master, I\'ve recently started playing in a game.  We\'ve had 3 game masters and in each game, there was almost no PC to PC communication.    I quickly realized that was because there was only GM to/from PC communication.\n\nWhat I mean is that players felt that the GM was the only person at the table who could move the game forward in any way.  PC to PC communication was not helpful.  Even in combat, a player asked: ""How many Orcs are there in the hall?""  I said, ""There are three.""   The player gave me a dirty look and said, ""Let\'s let the GM answer that question.""   It was at that point that I realized that the whole group had been taught that the GM was the only authority and only way to move/make the story.  \n\nIn my game, if a player asks ""How many Orcs are in the hall?"", I expect one of the other players to answer that and all questions of that type.  If I told the group there were three in the hall, then every player should know that and be able to tell other players.  I listen and if something incorrect comes out, such as an assumption that may be faulty, I stop and point that out.  \n\nI\'ve found the way to get that to happen is to give up a little of that iron fist and let other players speak with authority.  If a player repeats something I said, then I expect other players to take that as the truth as it is known.  I also don\'t do three-way conversations.  I find that limits PC to PC communication.  If two players are asking a bunch of questions, but they could be talking to each other, then I push it in that direction. \n\nOnce you start encouraging players to speak to each other rather than only speak to the GM, then things start to loosen up.  I think that is really helpful.  \n\nSo as the GM, you can\'t let players think that they can\'t ask each other questions and allow them to move the story by themselves, rather than being the sole arbiter of the story.  Really, it is the player\'s story to tell, don\'t force them to tell you the story then you tell it back.  ', 'Have rules that reward it.

rpg,t3_a6h7k0,"How to engage your druid players in D&amp;D!A lot of how I run games and try to make my games better comes down to narrative.

And lately I've been thinking a lot about the player-DM interaction. The difference between planning a ""story"" for the players to play and crafting an adventure around the players themselves.

If you're custom-tailoring your adventure I think a great way to make your games more immersive, more unique, and more narratively interesting is to play to the classes of your player's characters - giving the Wizard an opportunity to do Wizardly things, the Barbarian Rage-y things.

It sounds obvious, but I don't know how common it is for DM's to consider this in planning out adventures. I put together my thoughts (&amp; some ideas) on how to do this well for **Druids** in your party in a video: [https://youtu.be/hSSJVhBKzoY](https://youtu.be/hSSJVhBKzoY)

To facilitate this it has really robust mechanics to create your own interstellar sector filled with all kinds of planets, cultures and whathaveyou. But the crown are its faction turn mechanics. Through it you fill your interstellar sector with all kinds of factions (interplanetary governments, corporations, cults, pirate bands, etc) and you as a GM can play a little mini-game of singleplayer Diplomacy or Civilisation with them. Each faction gets attributes, hitpoints, units and objectives. You then shuffle those factions around, try to have them fulfill their objectives to earn XP to better their attributes in order to become more powerful. It's such an amazing way to keep a universe vibrant and alive *around* the players, and it's like an auto-adventure generator. Even though it's a little clunky and takes a bit of winging it and a whole bunch of spreadsheet play its results are *so* worth it.\n\nFor example, I'm running a game of imperial science-fiction (inspired on the SWN actual play show Far Verona) and it has a whole bunch of noble houses as factions that are now on the edge of civil war.

When you or the enemy reach 0 hp you don\'t die, you\'ve just lost your buffer to avoid real damage.  When you hit 0 and all hits from then on give you a random critical injury.  This randomness is biased to more serious and fatal injuries depending on how much excess damage you receive per hit - the ""per hit"" is a big difference from other systems which usually accumulates the excess damage to guarantee a swift end.  You also could inflict or receive a mortal injury that wasn\'t immediately fatal allowing for some savage last stand moments and the classic victorious dead hero walk.  It worked really well in the game as most adventures were focused on investigations and social interactions.  Combat was infrequent, but when it would occur was very dramatic and unpredictable.  Violence wasn\'t something you could just use thoughtlessly.  Even a peasant with a 2x4 could potentially end your career with a lucky blow.\n\nMy favorite item creation rule is ""Key Items"" for magic items.  I made this in DnD3.0 because I just didn\'t like the crafting rules or that it just seemed like gold turned into magic items as it seemed to just suck the magic out of magic items.  So players come up with the idea for their magic item, and I come back to them with the required Key Items they need which could range from monster parts to relics to just specific knowledge about something.  Once they retrieved the key items they could make the item then, no check or anything, the hard work already done.  The main point was keeping adventuring the focus of the game as our 3rd edition games before would sometimes seem like they turned into a Quickbooks simulator which none of us really liked.', ""Best Friend/Rival from Panty Explosion. One player (or I don't know, character if you feel that way) is your best Friend, another is your Rival. If you roll for something and succeed, your Best Friend says what happens. If you fail the roll, your Rival does. Simple and involves more people around the table than just theperson trying to do something.

To play optimally, you *must* reference and touch opon as many of these aspects as possible, thereby engaging with the story and the fictional situation.

rpg,t3_a6fmf2,"What TTRPG system would you recommend for a Len'en Project game?So, I was thinking about beginning a short campaign that takes place on the Len'en Project universe. For those who don't know, it's a danmaku series of games heavily inspired by Touhou, although it takes place on a completely different setting. The atmosphere of Len'en Project's world, Mugenri, is much bleaker than that of Touhou's Gensokyo, and unlike the latter's spell card duels, which are essentially a more diplomatic and graceful way to settle things, and ultimately non-lethal, Len'en is more deadly on that aspect.

I think that would also allow for a system that isn't that much focused on the danmaku aspect. None of the Touhou RPG systems seem to be appealing for me, either for playing Touhou or Len'en.

rpg,t3_a6epy5,"Minigames in an rpg [Warning: old video game references]In many video game jrpg's, somewhere in your travels you'll encounter a casino, circus or other area with many minigames to play, like Final Fantasy 7 and Chrono Trigger.

In some video games, one minigame is big in the universe and spans the entire game, like Blitzball in Final Fantasy 10 or Tetra Master in Final Fantasy 9.

In one of my tabletop campaigns, in a particular city-kingdom on the moon a peculiar game is popular. Even the king plays it regularly, sometimes organizing tournaments. Winner gets an audition with the king.

The players can play it too, with real playing cards. I call it ""12."" It's a game I made myself. I'm not good at naming. Full rules below.

Other games could be regular trick-taking card games like Whist, Colour Whist, Manille or Oh Hell, or simply blackjack. Many of these games have so many rule variants (often to do with scoring, less with actual play), you can take a rule variant, reskin the game cards and rules (playing the 6 of hearts from your hand becomes ""Knighting the six villagers of Hearthwood""), and make it a fantasy game your players have never heard about.

Note that in real-life, the game variants differ from region to region. There are three cities near where I live, in a triangle 20 km apart, one city's variant plays exclusively with 6 cards, the next city plays with 5 cards, and the last city plays with 4 cards. The game's called *Kwajongen* in the local dialects, it's not played outside those cities (and a few villages behind them), and it has no English name that I can find.

Have you thought about layering a minigame in your tabletop game? If so, which?

---

Rules of 12:

Everyone has five cards in hand: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 6. The first they do is play a card from their hand face-down before them on the table.

In your turn: first you flip over all face-down cards in front of you, then can do three things:

- **Play a card:** Play a card from your hand face-down.

- **Draw a card:** Pick any card from any player, face-up or face-down, on the table and add it to your hand.

- **Match cards:** Multiply one or more face-up cards together. When you multiply up to exactly 12, you win.

Two additional rules:

- When all cards in your hand add up to 18 or higher, you lose the game. When playing with 3 or more players, the cards on the table in front of you stay in the game, the cards in your hand are not in the game any more.

- The Ace counts for 1 in your hand. When you reveal it face-up and as long as it stays face-up, all cards of your suit on the table are doubled in value. So a 2 counts as a 4 while face-up on the table and a 4 becomes an 8. I'm not 100% sure about this rule, since the 4 becomes worthless as you can't multiply it to 12, the 6 becomes 12 which is definitely interesting, but you lose access to the 2 and 3 of your own suit. If anything, what the Ace would do could become customized from region to region.

- Something I toy with to fix this: The game can only be played with 4 players, in teams of two, sitting opposed to each other (similar to Whist). In this way, you always have a team member to help you and your team wins or loses together, shortening the games a bit. I haven't been able to playtest this though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a6epy5/minigames_in_an_rpg_warning_old_video_game/,"['I think that if your players are super dedicated to learning and playing then absolutely go for it.

rpg,t3_a6bf1s,"Lich Strategies and Tactics(This is from the book on liches I am working on. As always  I am open to feedback.)

If the lich is sufficiently lucid, it will spend time studying foes, both current and probable, in terms of tactics, and strategies used. For example, it will use *speak with dead* to interrogate someone’s victims. Once it understands the tactics of an enemy  it will develop specific plans for what to do if it encounters that foe. If the lich spends more than a month, but less than a year, intently studying a particular group of individuals, it will have a +1 circumstance bonus to all attacks, and skill rolls involving that party. If the lich spends more than a year studying a particular group of individuals, it will have a +2 circumstance bonus to those rolls. 

The Sorrow Lords plot multifaceted strategies. They will move against any perceived support structures or weak points its enemies possess. A lich will wait until the party is preoccupied elsewhere – perhaps raiding the lair of a rival monster it indirectly told them about. Then it will murder the family members and friends\[1\] of the party, destroy the party’s base of operations, steal any wealth and items the party does not have with them, and frame the party for crimes they did not commit. Once the party is devastated, strung-out by grief and horror, and on the run, will the lich make a serious effort to attack the party directly. However, a party moving quickly will surprise a lich.

1st level NPC, fresh off the farm/orphanage  vs the traditional giant rat.

This system is electronic, PC/console right now, but will hopefully transition to paper if it works!. The player doesn't have to calc anything, just press Attack (normally this is them trying to move onto the rat's location).

A player could do 2 attacks a second, roughly.

I know that, mechanically speaking, D&amp;D and similar games do not pose many restrictions in the Paladin's background, -- but canonically speaking (in settings like Greyhawk, Forgotten Realms, etc...), it seems to me that Paladins are more likely to have a Noble/Aristocratic background than come from a poor family. This is because the Paladin is primarily based on the medieval Knight, which to the best of my knowledge, was of Aristocratic origins.

Knighthood wasn\'t all that special depending on where and when they lived; many knights weren\'t granted land, just the title... just being a knight put them on the bottom rung of the aristocracy.\n\nThe problem with Paladins (and other religion-based classes) in D&amp;D is that neither the game nor its settings address religious infrastructure (or any kind of organization for that matter) very well.

So it isn’t really implied in the traditional fantasy settings like DnD’s Forgotten Realms or Pathfinder’s Golarion.', 'Depends entirely on how you interpret paladins.

In fact, they're *more* likely to come a poor background than a rich one by simple demographics--there are a lot more poor people in the world than there are rich ones."", 'I like the idea of a ghetto paladin. ', ""I'd say paladins are less likely, at least in my setting. More nobles become heavy fighters, being able to afford the training and equipment for that, but a paladin's main qualification is their faith and divine insight. That sort of thing is available to people of any class, and it's arguable that nobility would be slightly more prone to having a corrupt or secular mindset. For a paladin, the church would see an obligation to provide them with some basic equipment they couldn't otherwise afford, and the paladin would be faithful in their service in response."", 'In most medieval-ish D&amp;D settings, paladins are often called to service. They\'re basically the military arm of their religious order, and so most of their accouterments (armor, horse, weapons, etc) are probably provided by that order. If you look at 5e, for example, they have the option of starting out with armor, several weapons, and all the gear that they really need (just like all the other classes).  \n  \nThe class that is most often ""rich people only"" is the cavalier, because those are basically non-religious knights. You could probably also make the case that most wizards are going to be upper or middle class; the level of time and scholarship required to learn magic (rather than instinctual magic like a sorcerer or gifted magic like a cleric or warlock) probably prevents the poor from pursuing it very often.', 'Often but not exclusively, I feel. A lot do have noble titles, but theres nothing implicit. Most Fantasy settings, especially those with D&amp;D roots, presume a pretty generous amount of options for upward mobility. I feel like a lot of character with titles in D&amp;D lore earned them\nBy deeds, for example.', ""(5e) Paladins dedicate their lives to an ideology. That is decidedly not something a potato farmer can leave their livelihood behind to do. I think that's why there's the impression of a Paladin being aristocratic: their reason to go adventuring is generally centered around that abstract concept rather than making money. It's easier to picture a Fighter or Ranger who lives on the fringe of society for purely pragmatic reasons, but with Paladins their romantic connection to something bigger than themselves is tied to the class.\n\nNow of course this doesn't mean Paladins *have* to be that way. You could be a dexterity Paladin wearing the clothes on her back and wielding her late father's meat cleaver. I'm just saying that the popular portrayal of Paladins as being someone who has on plate armor and can dedicate their life to their oath seems unlikely to happen without some generational wealth involved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"", ""&gt;it seems to me that Paladins are more likely to have a Noble/Aristocratic background than come from a poor family. This is because the Paladin is primarily based on the medieval Knight, which to the best of my knowledge, was of Aristocratic origins.\n\nI'll go against the grain here and note that yes, there may be something that explicitly points to paladins being of high social class. \n\n1e's Unearthed Arcana made the paladin a sub-class of the Cavalier.

rpg,t3_a67fig,"Desperate for a space fantasy RPG system with narrative/cinematic action, some crunch/tactics, low prepI've been looking for months for a system to play a campaign i've already started but put on hold due to not being satisfied with system choice.

I've read a lot of online discussions, reviews, manuals, but still i haven't found the system i want.

The setting i'm using is completely homebrew; a mix of star trek and mass effect with a military focus, with the characters acting as heroes in a troubled galaxy. I'm not opposed to heavy homebrewing of existing systems, where possible. *(I'm homebrewing my own races and likely my own starship combat rules, anyway*)

I'm going to run this campaign for a while, expecting at least 3-5 years.

I'm looking for:

**- cinematic action**. *I tried starting out with* ***Esper genesi******s****, which is basically D&amp;D 5e in space, but it's just become exchanging damage numbers with little possibilities for cinematic actions and way too much prep time. Tried* ***WOIN*** *and* ***Starfinder***\*, for the same result.\*

**- some crunch**. *I designed my own PBTA hack for a previous campaign, which worked well. However, it lacks crunch and tactical options. At its core, anything you do is equally as succeful as everything else. Good for short bursts, not for 5 years. Also considered* ***FATE*** *or* ***Numenera***\*, but again, near zero in-game tactics.\*

**- low prep.** *I'm already dedicating some 20 hours a week for a weekly session, but i want this to focus on story, creating media, etc. Not building monsters or designing dungeon maps.*

**- preferably little DM rolling**. *I want to concentrate telling a story, not rolling dice. I excluded* ***Genesys*** *for this reason, even if i like the system. Nice but not critical.*

**- able to resolve multiple types of scenarios**. *I want to do cinematic guerrila battles ala star wars, mad chases, war scenarios, fleet battles, mech battles, political intrigue. Without having a different ruleset for everything.*

**- with a neutral or easily changed theme**. *My campaign is very specifically about a specific faction operating a specific spaceship, with an estabilished setting that's been run for close to 10 years now. We started medieval fantasy, to plane-hopping, to futuristic fantasy, and now we are going to space. I'm excluding* ***Coriolis*** *and* ***Eclipse Phase*** *for being too interlinked with their setting.*

&amp;#x200B;

I really, really like the resolution mechanics of *Blades in the dark* and its hacks, with position and effect being just the right amount of tactical, and i think the whole crew/faction game would be great for this campaign. However, i'm not sure the system really works for an heroic/epic story. Plus, half the system really is not in theme with my campaign. And i'm getting weird vibes from it, and in games it feels sometimes the mechanics are a little... weird. Like everything works *almost* right, but you can't really be sure because the rules are very, very open to interpretation.

Ideally, i'd want something betweend PBTA and BITD, and i've expressed my concerns with both these systems.

&amp;#x200B;

I know i'm making it very hard on myself, but i'm really exhausted with the lack of something that works like i want. I don't want to abandon my campaign plans for which i have spent a lot of time and money already.

Can anyone offer some insight, or someobscure systems that i've somehow missed?

The art is plentiful and used well.\n\nThe stronghold rules look really solid and easily usable, and I like the fact that Matt gives an insight into some of the design choices such as build costs.  5e is a fairly simple edition and, at first glance, these new rules seem to add a lot without becoming bogged down in too much crunch.  I definitely appreciate that.  The advantages the different stronghold types provided are nice and flavourful, and offer quite distinct benefits to different classes.\n\nI didn't have quite so much time to check out the warfare rules or look at how the different types of followers, units etc. all work. There's a lot to dig through there.\n\nThere's also a bestiary section and a section containing new magic items.  Most of the monsters weren't really my thing, but that's entirely from a flavour point of view.I'll have a look at them properly and might end up reskinning some to suit my own tastes, as I'm sure that they are pretty nifty mechanically. The new rules allow for a new class of magic item that improves the stronghold rather than directly benefits the player (such as wondrous altars and the like).  Pretty cool stuff.\n\nOverall, I can't wait to dig into the guts of the book properly and add the player strongholds and followers to my games.  I started with B/X and have always missed those parts of the game in later editions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Forgot to add that the included adventure, The Siege of Castle Rend, is quite a bit bigger than I imagined!

rpg,t3_a66gea,"Making the Map for your Homebrew CampaignI have been working on a series of videos focused on making a homebrew campaign setting from scratch and this week I made the first version of the campaign map.

I like to get a rough version of a map done as early as possible in the design process so that I can let the geography of the land inspire me, but also so that I still have flexibility to change the map to fit the setting as I develop it. 

You can check out there video here: https://youtu.be/15NnHisKDSU

Do you prefer to start with a map, or do you make your campaign maps at the end of designing a homebrew campaign?  

Much love

rpg,t3_a6697j,"FATE, Savage Worlds, or something else?My bro and I are looking for a good system to play through a Wheel of Time (the book series - READ IT.) setting. I was thinking (in my limited exp) maybe Savage Worlds, because it's system light, and it'd be pretty easy to work Channeling in I think. Concerns: It may be a little lethal? And it may be harder to have that sandboxey, explorative, 'scene'-based feel. The combat system is probably my fave tho.

Either that or FATE, though I haven't actually played through it myself... I just like how scene-based it is; less mechanics-based and more collaborative story-telling? But we do want SOME tactical combat, so I'm not sure.

...there's an official Pathfinder port, but it's honestly kind of awful and really incomplete IMO. You can't just slap channeling onto vancian spellcasting.

Thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a6697j/fate_savage_worlds_or_something_else/,"[""Cortex Prime is a really good option. It's... not quite released yet? But I think it's possible to get access to the beta version if you pre-order (maybe)."", ""The biggest problem I have with Savage Worlds is the whiffing. It's not hard to hit someone and then do nothing of any consequence to them. Over and over and over. It's not always like that, sure, but it crops up enough to be an issue. For me.\n\nFate lacks any meaningful crunch. I mean, it's there, but if your players like crunch at all (i.e. some rules and options to both aspire to and build around and so on), or if they like leveling, then Fate will not really work all that well. It's great for RP but often a bit underwhelming in fights.\n\nYou need to pick your poison and decide what you want at the table, rules-wise. If you like Savage Worlds and love the combat, spend some time making custom magic systems for it and call it a day.\n\nAny system you use that isn't official will need to be tweaked some to handle the unique flavor of the magic. Due to that, a familiar system like Savage Worlds might be best.\n\nThat said...\n\nIf you're familiar with Mutants and Masterminds (any version), you could probably build a custom power to reflect the magic systems of the setting as well, then just agree on some parameters for character building to keep someone from making something stupidly out of whack. Hero Points help give the players some narrative control, particularly if you're loose about how they are spent and are fairly liberal in handing them out.\n\nCortex Prime/Plus, as another person suggested, is fantastic. So good. But it has some of the same openness that can hobble Fate for some players, and wrapping your head around the die mechanic and how it scales and interacts with SFX and Limits and whatnot can take a bit of getting used to. Once you do, it's amazing for cinematic action stories, but there is a learning curve and no leveling and weird XP usage if you're familiar with Savage Worlds and D&amp;D's method of XP."", 'If you want to use FATE but think it is not quite crunchy enough, check out the Dresden Files game. It is a really good example of how to do FATE a bit crunchier, with different schools of magic and such.', ""1. I'd do it on Fate, as most stuff I play. Channeling would be a great source of compels...\n\n2. I read half of the series, then got bored. Won't read it again.\n\n3.

I use savage worlds plenty and use the general rule “I won’t kill you unless I want to” meaning I won’t kill a character unless it’s thematically appropriate, exceptionally cool, or you’re being a horrible dipshit. Two of those I ask first and the last I’ve only done once. I also use “dire peril” which I declare at the beginning of an encounter to tell players that whatever’s coming up is playing for keeps, mostly if I want the fight to be really tense or to tell players they are sincerely out of their depth.

You could go either Fate Core or Fate Accelerated if you want to make it a bit more steamlined. Fate is a ton of fun and there are a ton of ways to use compels for WoT. \n\nExamples:\n\n1. Things are getting tense at a dinner party between some nobles and one PC is a wolfbrother. He senses the wolves calling out to him, but can't give into his feral nature yet. But the GM can offer a compel which if taken, would make the dinner scene awesome as the PC goes wolf-y\n2. A male channeler PC lets loose with the One Power but you feel like the scene should be more like when Rand looses control in the book. A compel is a great way to start and, honestly, as players, we all love the idea of letting loose and obliterating a part of the countryside. I know I as a player would jump at the opportunity to go crazy for a moment as the One Power overwhelms my character\n\nDresden Files Accelerated would be a good example of how to do Mantles, which are basically collections of stunts and whatnot, that could be used as examples of how to handle some things in a WoT setting. "", ""If you want something with a bit more crunch that still has some narrative support, check out Genesys. That plus the Realms of Terrinoth fantasy supplement gives you everything you should need for any fantasy property. While I haven't read the books, I think the verb-based magic system in Genesys is way more flexible and easier to layer into an existing fictional magic system than a spell-based, Vancian system."", ""I'm not familar with WoT, so I'm not entirely sure how their magic works...\n\nBUT, if you do want to use Pathfinder without Vancian casting, you may want to look into the 3PP addon, [Spheres of Power](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/start), which guts Vancian casting and replaces it with an MP system of its own design.  It's pretty modular, so you can build a lot of different specialists with it.\n\nOf course, Savage Worlds might be the best answer here.  I wouldn't know - not my kinda deal."", 'Fate would work really well.Check out the great stuff they did with spellcasting and supernatural powers in Dresden Files.', 'For Savage Worlds, you may impose an hard cap on the ibcoming wounds: a Wild Card can never take more than 3 Wounds from a single attack, no mattwr the damage, and use the setting rule Heroes Never Die. Using powers to do tricks can also be incredible fun!\n\nFate is good in order to design the specific use and effect of a power (in this case, a talent), while leaving space for a narrative tweaking.\n\nI would suggest to use the best of the two.\nAssign aspects to Savage Worlds scenes, and let your players invoke them spending a Benny to gain a +2 on their roll. Let everyone compel and tempt in order to make the Bennies flow. Maybe let your player take a couple of aspects neither edge nor hindrances, to reinforce this.', 'Savage has a new version coming out as a pdf, probably by the end of this month.  Supposedly the lethality has been toned down.', ""I'm working on a new RPG that's about heroes fighting dark forces and saving the realm. It's open-ended to creative role-play, and custom genre/setting details like FATE. However, it is more focused on danger, risks, and the possibility of death and failure. It might be more lethal than you like, but it maintains that gamey, high-risk feel old school RPGs have, that FATE somewhat lacks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game is called Heroic Dark.

Add an extra ""cosmetic damage"" wound, double the power points, and make your own spell list and this is more or less all you need.\n\nOther posters have mentioned Cortex. I adore how Cortex is designed, but it\'s kinda fluffy and really swingy because the GM rolls to set difficulty. I don\'t think that will feel right for The Wheel of Time.\n\nIf I had to give you an ideal solution, I would say either convert World of Darkness or 7th Sea, but those options are really effort intensive and are closer to creating a hack than running a system.', 'How heavily will you be working with channeling?

rpg,t3_a666k8,"Draconic Negotiation: A very short side-quest that provides a twist to a common trope.https://i.imgur.com/DGrhXzu.png

# Background 

A job board posting requests the heroes negotiate with a small dragon to prevent it from trying to kidnap a small princess.  The job board promises a hefty reward of 25,000g to anyone who is successful, but warns that there is a bigger, scarier dragon and that negotiation is the only option.

When the players seek out the employer, Wilfred Barnes, he explains that his 5-year-old daughter, Marissa, is constantly harassed by the ""neighborhood dragon"", a a 6-year-old boy named Timothy Blades who enjoys dressing up and pretending he is a dragon. Timothy tries to ""kidnap"" Marissa when she is playing outside, but Marissa is not interested in playing along. 

Wilfred has attempted to resolve the issue on his own by talking to Timothy's parent, but Mr. Blades is a very large, very scary man and would not hear any of it. Wilfred tried talking to Timothy directly, but his father got angry and said if he ever saw Wilfred near his son again, he would make him regret it.

Wilfred doesn't want to get Mr. Blades involved and would like someone to talk to Timothy to try to get him to leave Marissa alone.

# Events

If you want to speed through this, you can flash forward to the players sitting on the stoop of a house next to a small child in a dragon costume. The players are discussing personal boundaries with the child. They need to just make one diplomacy check and the child will understand, otherwise he'll go ask his parents. 

If you want to take a little longer, they can find Timothy outside his home pretending to be a dragon, ""terrorizing"" other kids by chasing them, destroying sand castles, and stealing toys. The players have a couple options for resolving the situation.

1. They can be direct with Timothy, telling him to leave others out of his game without permission. This will likely upset the child.

2. They can pretend they are negotiating with a powerful dragon. Timothy demands sacrifice and tribute, or he will will continue ravaging the countryside.

3. They can pretend to fight a powerful dragon. Run a combat with Timothy as a dragon. He makes things up as he goes along, and no one actually tries to hurt anyone. Regardless of if the players are victorious or not,  Timothy has a blast and is willing to listen to requests.

4. They talk to his father. Timothy's father is an angry, bitter man who is unwilling to listen. His temper is short as he tries to deal with the loss of his wife and being a single father. He wants the best for his child, but also has no time for himself between his job and making sure his son is taken care of. If any of the stress can be relieved, he is willing to listen to the players.

If the players are able to convince Timothy to leave Marissa alone, or at least ask permission before including her in his games, they can return to her father for a reward. He pays them 25 gold, and if they question it he points out that the advertisement stated twenty five point zero zero zero (25.000) gold, not twenty-five thousand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a666k8/draconic_negotiation_a_very_short_sidequest_that/,"['This could be a lot of fun with the right group.

I got some good advice and decided to act on some of it and give the PCs a shot. It worked out well so far.

The sorceress decided to deliver her message to them in person, albeit, magically disguised as a washerwoman and when she went to the tavern she assumed they'd be in, there was only one the rogue there. She delivered the message, but he was suspicious and eventually started roughing her up a bit to see what she would do; he was hoping to get her to tell him more about the person she was bringing the note from.

Eventually she said she'd lead him to where she spoke to the person that gave her the message. I fully intended to have her reveal herself as the sorceress and try to talk to him, but he grew suspicious when he watched her waiting by a door in an alleyway and went back to find the group.

Shortly thereafter the team descended upon the house the rogue said the messenger was last seen at. The warrior on the roof to spot anyone trying to escape, with another at the front door and the rest in the back. While the group inside were interrogating an innocent couple in their kitchen, the sorceress started sending messages to the warrior on the roof; she was watching from the house across the street.

When the sorceress felt she had gotten through to the warrior, she flew over and revealed herself and kind of won his trust, before saying she was sorry for her part in what went on and flying off again.  

The warrior didn't reveal much of the conversation with the sorceress and most importantly, didn't even mention that it was the sorceress that gave him the information on the location of the BBEG's lair. With some reservation, they decided to follow the warrior toward the mountains, where his mysteriously acquired information indicated they needed to go. Next session, they'll confront the BBEG.

Asking for science!,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a60vl2/pbta_2d6_vs_bitd_1d6_pros_cons/,"[""The BitD dice pool mechanic makes it more feasible to try to stack up bonuses without blowing the bell curve completely away. In baseline PbtA you can grab a high enough bonus to make failure impossible; in BitD it's always a possibility, no matter how many dice you're rolling."", 'It is not about number of dice rolled, it is about how you read those rolls. Accurate comparison would be ""PbtA Moves vs. BitD Action Roll"".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAction Roll is basically a difficulty setting, but instead of counting modifiers and advantage/disadvantage - you talk position/effect. Even though numerical outcome\'s probability depends on number of dice (which is determined by player) - setting position to Desperate and effect to Zero on an action extremely unlikely to succeed is a way for GM to represent character struggling against something really dangerous. It is also a more complex (and time-consuming, until you get used to it) mechanic to resolve, but for players that like to engage with mechanics - it\'s all good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoves are much more fixed in what they do and are primary source of people claiming that ""no matter are you fighting a goblin or a dragon - chance of landing a solid hit is the same"". It is not exactly true, but there is some truth in it. Also - it is much more fixed in when each Move triggers - Actions can be used more creatively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother thing to mention is that every character in BitD has all Actions to roll on, but not every character in PbtA game has access to every Move.', ""Blades isn't 1d6"", ""they both have multiple levels of success, but the two biggest things you get out of *Blades'* pools are the easy injection of what devil's bargains represent, and having the skill granularity really change the available results – like, you can't really stack successes with *PbtA*, where you can with *Blades*."", 'I think the PbtA 2d6 are a bit more elegant mathematically. The fact that your chance of rolling a partial hit is almost constant from -1 to +3 is pretty great since partials are the heart and soul of PbtA games. That the probabilities of full hit and miss are inverted at the extremes are very nice too. \n\nThe biggest downside is that the range of viable attribute scores is pretty limited. ', ""The difference here is in linearity for the most part. \n\n1d6 has 6 results, each of them are equally likely at about 16.67%. \n\n2d6 has 11 results, however if you graph the odds of getting any number, you'll get a bell curve. There is a 2.78% chance of getting a 2. There is a 2.78% chance of getting a 12. But there is a 16.67% chance of getting a 7. That means 1 out of 6 rolls will be a 7, while about 1 out of 36 being a 12. The difference in odds between the lows/highs and the average roll becomes more pronounced as you add more dice to a die pool.\n\nPractically, this means the majority of rolls will be pretty well in the middle with a 2d6. This makes the very highs and very lows more rare, so you can tie more impactful mechanics to them. Flat modifiers in dice pools are also more impactful as naturally getting a high roll is more rare. Ultimately, dice pools give a feeling of reliability. Your rolls are a bit more dependable, and less swingy. This means the chance of failure at a skill you are good at is lessened. However, this also discourages people from stepping out of their area of expertise, as the chances of getting that lucky roll feel much lower.\n\nHowever, a linear system (such as a 1d6) is swingy. Each roll feels more impactful and random. This allows the dice to create tension and randomness, which can be great. But it also limits reliability. Games that use linear dice mechanics have to be careful about tying them to mundane tasks - otherwise one day my mechanic can make a howitzer out of three aluminum cans, a pack of gum and a rake, the next day he blows up his muscle car because he rolled poorly checking the oil. Linear systems are often good for combat focused games as the regilar highs and lows add tension.\n\nTldr; Dice pools simulate reliability and make long odds special, but discourage stepping out of areas of specialization. Linear dice systems add randomness and swinginess, making every roll impactful, but also increase the chance you get that session where you can't succeed at that one thing you are supposed to be good at."", '&gt;They largely achieve similar outcomes\n\nYou are drasticly underetimating how blades works. \n\nYour skipping\n\n* position/effect\n* devil’s bargins\n* clocks\n* assists, teamwork, pushing yourself\n* resisting consequences\n* and having multiple dice.

rpg,t3_a5xy6n,"What's the deal with character builds and min/maxing?I got my start with B/X D&amp;D in 1981, stayed out of the hobby for awhile and have made my way back in over the last four years or so. It was a simpler time. We had rotary phones. Home computers, microwaves and VCRs were not yet ubiquitous. We used crayons to color in our dice so we could read the numbers and we liked it, dammit!

I never played 3.x, Pathfinder or 4e but I have played some 5e. When I played 5e, while there is a lot to like about the rule system and I'm ecstatic to see that it's so popular, character building was not something I really thought highly of. The whole min/maxing thing and having specific character _builds_ just turns me off a bit. On top of that, character generation and even leveling could be a bit of a chore at times.

To me, it feels way more like a video game than what I was used to from a pen-and-paper RPG. It's almost like you're trying to win the game through the art of character building or something. The PCs are super heroes, the encounters balanced, and it just didn't feel dangerous. It seems like the goal of playing is to continue to advance your character and unlock new abilities rather than unlock mysteries and new dangers. 

Because of this character building and the myriad of combat modifiers one can have, combat seemed to slow to a crawl sometimes. I've heard it's still faster than 3.x/PF and 4e but I don't have the background to make that comparison. Don't get me wrong, I know a lot of this has to do with the GM and whatnot, and that 5e can be played in more of an OSR or streamlined style, but that doesn't seem to be how most people play it.

Accepting that part of this could be chalked up to my relative inexperience with this type of gaming my question is, what do people enjoy about this style of game, particularly when compared to another style of play, such as OSR for example? I'm not trying to accuse anybody of wrong-fun or anything like that, I'm just trying to get a handle on it and get some different perspectives.  Right now I'm mostly playing OSR games.

Personally, I like variety in problems - so I like optimization problems, riddles, puzzles, the improv and story-telling required in PbtA, tactical combat, old-school traps, etc.', 'The thing is that character building is the part of the game you can do without other people.', ""It turned me off at first, and still does at some of the higher levels of wildness, but here's the way that I see it: with OSR, characters are sort of flat in terms of rules. This solves a lot of problems, and creates a lot of RP opportunity, but while you can decide to play the a swashbuckler extraordinaire or the master of earth magic, there's not much in the way for rules to back it up. In the 3.+ model, you can really see it. If you want to be the fastest archer in the land, you can organize your character to be the fastest archer in the land, and it will be evident any time you get in an arrow fight.\n\nI scoffed at it at first, but it is a lot of fun to play, and it sort of pushes back against some of the contrary situation where your character just fails to be the sort of character you want it to be. Of course, OSR would respond with a sort of tough love approach there, but I enthusiastically like to be able to experience both, in different contexts.   \n(Oh, and for PbtA, or at least Dungeon World, imagine it's someone trying to put the experience of B/X on rails.)"", 'So, I\'m one of the five people in the world who actually liked 4e, *because* of how tactically crunchy and detailed the character building and combat were. But I\'m a wargamer; that sort of thinking comes naturally to me, and I enjoy the ""tactical problem-solving"" aspect of the game for exactly the same reasons I like playing 40K, X-Wing, and Overwatch, and shooting 3-gun.\n\nIt\'s not about trying to ""win"" the game by building the most powerful character possible; it\'s about deriving enjoyment from the act of optimization itself, and from seeing the time and effort spent in that optimization process come to fruition in the game. It\'s the maker mentality: ""I started with a pile of parts and tools, and I built a thing, and that thing *works*, and that\'s awesome!""\n\n&gt;Now don\'t even get me started on PbtA. I completely don\'t get that lol.\n\nThat actually surprises me. From everything else you said, I\'d think Dungeon World would be right up your alley. ', 'Character builds can be shared as a communal experience in ways individual games cannot. Hence you see more of it online.', '&gt; It seems like the goal of playing is to continue to advance your character and unlock new abilities rather than unlock mysteries and new dangers.\n\nI don\'t think having super-powered characters negates ""unlocking mysteries and new dangers"" at all. Some people like uncovering ever-deeper secrets of lore and bigger and badder evils... and punching them in the face. *Discovery* doesn\'t have to mean fear/danger (in terms of actual danger that your character may die), some folks just like feeling badass and roaming around being successful and winning glory.\n\nFor other people, building a character to be as efficient as possible is the challenge, just as much as ""figuring out how to steal a dragon\'s treasure without waking the dragon, with only 3 hirelings, 100 ft of rope, and two castings of bigby\'s hand"" might be the challenge to an OSR player. They look for loopholes, compare costs and values, and in the end build a really neat toy they can either a) show off to other toy builders, or b) bring into a dungeon to see how it runs in a ""real"" scenario (because what\'s the point of building a toy if you can\'t wind it up and watch it go?).\n\nStill other people don\'t care about the challenge or the glory, they just want to play out stories, either the GM\'s story or their character\'s (or, obviously, a mixture of both) but since the kind of stories they like have conflict and combat, they have that too. But the GM is going to be using an encounter building to build ""fair"" encounters and the players don\'t want to spend a lot of time looking at character options and making sure their characters are ""fair"" to said encounters, so they can just look online and find those builds other people have posted and focus on the rest of the game (or, heck, maybe they do like combat but not character building so they use the premade builds as a shortcut).\n\nI dunno, you\'ve already acknowledged that different people can play the game in different ways for different reasons so the answer to ""why do you think this thing is fun?"" is usually ""because I do it and it\'s fun.""', ""At the tables I've played at, it definitely seems like it comes down to the type of play you enjoy. Crunch-focused players are going to want the most optimized build, as are people who play to feel like Big Damn Heroes. My narrative players (and myself) tend to opt for less optimal builds in favor of interesting story elements.\n\nThat's not to say that optimization and story are mutually exclusive. But I feel you hardcore on the min/maxing and character builds thing being a turn-off. I especially hate being at tables where people just *have* to comment if you aren't choosing the best spells/feats/powers in their opinion. Best is relative."", 'I was pretty munchkinized back in 1983 (in my defense, I was thirteen) so I\'m not sure I understand your issues.\n\nI mean, we have places like this to discuss ""how to make your character not die"" and I didn\'t have those back then. And there\'s been 30 years of ""so what happens if you cast Wall Of Force at neck level at an onrushing army of orcs? Is that, like, 10 XP times 200 orcs right on the spot?"" So that\'s why there\'s rules about Wall Of Force cannot be cast through a person.  \n\n\nEdit: And ""The encounters are balanced"" is very much a table-to-table thing. My GM\'ing rule is ""Not everything is balanced, but I try to give people a fair chance to notice that they\'re out of their depth.""', ""For me, the common definition of min/maxing has changed over the years.  It started out with AD&amp;D when you'd roll 3d6 down the line, then, if you wanted to adjust things, you'd 2 down 1 up your stats, which led to a lot of people with 5 charisma and wisdom running around with 17 strength.  You were literally minimizing your dump stats, to maximize your prime requisite.\n\nOnce 3e dropped, the label seems to be applied to anyone who builds a character with a coherent theme or internal consistency.   Taking a feat tree to support a schtick seems to qualify as min-maxing now, but if we're being honest, there's very little minimizing happening.   Even with point buy in D&amp;D, you can't dump a stat below 8, so you're not seeing the droves of gormless sub-morons running around with katanas you would back in the day.\n\n\nPersonally, I'm a fan of what many call min maxing these days, they create realistic characters that you'd expect to find in the real world.  How many people do you find that excel at more than one or two things?  Heroic characters don't need to invest their points in mundane things to be average, they can usually default anything to compete with average NPCs."", 'I don\'t like the term min/maxing to much as this is already limited to one aspect of optimization.\n\nHere are my definitions:\n\nOptimization: this is a kind of mini-game in character creation. How to get most for the best price. It\'s comparable to hunting for discounts while shopping. An optimizer just wants to have the best price. It simply is a hunting game, hunting for the best offer in the system.\n\nMin/maxing: this is a form of optimization, but it tries to max an aspect by dumping something else. An optimizer may actually end up being average in all, a min/maxer not. As a mini-game, min/maxing is about challenging the limitations of a system. It\'s more comparable to people who like to play the game ""find the error in ..."".\n\nPowergaming: this is all about playing the most powerful character, no matter how. It usually involves a lot of min/maxing for the sake of power. But it can also be achieved in other ways (i.e. cheating, being the GMs boyfriend ect.).\n\nI would say I\'m an optimizer. I like to build characters like online shopping. I do this with crunchy systems as a hobby (I loved SR3-4 for this). But I\'m not into min/maxing. I don\'t like lopsided characters at all. While a friend of mine likes to min/max (he\'s a scientist), but he has zero powergaming ambitions. So these can all be mixed up with different goals.', ""I think it's more that you HEAR min/maxers more often than not.  Someone who is into optimizing characters will talk a lot more about it and the game in general than someone who is not.  Like a person who likes tweaking their gaming pc over someone who just buys one and is done with it.  And consider someone who just makes characters but doesn't care about the system.  What are they going to actually talk about besides maybe sharing a game story that I probably lack the full context and referential knowledge of their group to fully understand.  But system talk, anyone can participate and they don't need to know a thing about the actual narrative of the game which tends to be very personal to the group.  Or at least that's my totally unproven speculation which I will hold as absolute truth.\n\nPbtA?  I only ran Blades in the Dark, but I think I get you there.  It's gamifying the plot, which if you are coming from old school dnd is basically everything you were taught not to do.  It doesn't really care about simulation, it cares more about big hand wave gestures and is more like directing a collaborative movie than a character simulation game to me."", ""It is the difference between challenging the player vs challenging the character.\n\n\nSome players don't like to be challenged yet they want their characters to be challenged that is why they make builds to overcome these challenges.\n\nMeanwhile a player that wants to be challenged himself does not care much about builds because you can't stat the real human that is yourself. "", ""Any strategy game that is sufficiently crunchy will have a mechanical discovery component, that is to say, looking at the various games options and finding things that work, things that don't work, things that work conditionally, etc. By necessity, this means that some options have to be better than others, because if everything works equally well, there's nothing to discover.\n\nIt's one of the reasons why card games like Magic have bad cards. Part of the fun is discovering good cards and good card combos. If all cards are equally good, there are no good cards to discover.\n\nSo it's essentially an intellectual challenge.\n\nKeep in mind that in 5e D&amp;D the power difference between good builds and average builds is *vastly* reduced compared to other editions. For example, an average fighter would be a champion with a greatsword dumping all ability score improvements into STR and CON. An optimized fighter would be a battle master with a halberd strategically using improvements to pick the polearm master and great weapon master feats. The optimized fighter is better at combat than the average one, but without completely overshadowing. So people who don't care about builds can play the game without being forced to care about builds in order to have a functional character."", ""Modern D&amp;D (3.0 onwards) has a heavy core rules set that involves tactical combat play and associated. It's no coincidence this occurred when WOTC took over the D&amp;D license as they're incredibly good at creating tactically challenging games requiring players to think of different builds and combinations to succeed as evidenced by Magic the Gathering.  This doesn't mean these games are miniature wargames, but it does mean that a large amount of time you will be playing them will involve miniature tactical tabletop battles. (Yes there's exceptions but this is generally the standard play.)  This also means your characters builds become more important so you can succeed in the core tactical combat play. The GM's role is to be expected to build a balanced series of these tactical combats for the players to engage in. Death may occur but this is meant to be unlikely and only occur with particular bad luck or during 'boss fights'. \n\nIn comparison OSR style games look at combat as war rather than sport. This means combats are about finding whatever strategic edge you can from using food to lure hungry animals to fight one another  to rerouting a river so it destroys the enemies army. This is a fundamental difference. In a modern game players finding some way around the GM's encounter that doesn't involve tactical combat is the exception not the rule. The GM may allow it , or may even just say it doesn't work so the GM's cool set piece encounter happen. Either way it's not the norm. This is in part because the game is designed around the idea of 'balance' so in much the same way the players may get upset if they come across a monster too tough for them, the GM may get upset if the players stomp through all of his tactical combats.\n\nIn OSR play it's generally the idea to avoid whatever combats exist or find creative ways to circumvent them. Combat is the exception not the rule. You don't even get much XP from monsters, instead XP comes from treasure collected to encourage exploration. Combats are also often an ingame punishment, the GM will be rolling for a lot of random encounters whilst exploring the dungeon for example and some of these may involve monsters far stronger than the party can deal with directly. Combat is also much riskier, hit points are much much lower, healing is super slow (1hp a night) Character builds are also pretty non-existent with characters. Instead player skill is important and how they approach the challenges by interacting with the environment. On the negatives this can mean that the heavy character and narrative based play ( although I think games other than DnD do this better now) some players like isn't possible if you're dying super easily and randomly generating your characters. Some people also just want to drink beer and roll dice to hit rather than constantly having to be on their toes like you do in an OSR game and lots of character death and the cruel nature of dice can make the game feel grim to play compared to heroic fantasy.\n\nTime is definitely a factor too. Whilst modern design doesn't stop players role-playing, since they'll be spending so much of their time fighting long tactical combats they may well not have time during the session to explore anything particularly indepth.  OSR games whilst being far lighter allow this to be explored more as combats are so quick so other elements like exploration or carousing in town become a regular part of play. I know I always found running modern D&amp;D that it was difficult to find time to do all the other cool stuff because so much was taken from combat and often the players answered problems with combat because that was the best and most reliable thing they could do.\n\nSaying that both styles of play are valid, there's no bad wrong fun. But this is the fundamental disconnect I think you're experiencing between the two styles. I'd say modern D&amp;D is really an entirely different game just with the same name attached. \n\nIronically PbtA secretly takes a lot of tenants of OSR style play, especially  and encapsulates them into a far looser framework. I'd suggest giving it a look."", 'Different people like different things. ', 'in theory, I agree with you. I\'d love to switch at least one of my groups over to a system like OD&amp;D where character builds are a minimal aspect of play. In essence modern D&amp;D is like two games-- one played around a table as a group, and one played alone in front of a spreadsheet. and in theory I don\'t like that, I\'d like the PCs to play people instead of optimized amalgamations.   \n\n\nand I say in theory, because in practice the 5e character creation minigame is fun as all heck. one of my fondest memories in gaming comes from the last session of a months-long campaign-- my old character had died just previously, and I could essentially build a new character designed specifically to steamroll that last session. and it was delicious. I stayed up until 5am tinkering with the thing to get it just right, and it was a blast. red mist abounded. I got more juice out of that one stupid multiclass than out of several ""serious"" characters over many previous games and campaigns.  If you\'re in the mood to do some serious homework, optimization can be a blast through and through.', 'Think about how the original had elf and dwarf as a ""class"". The first ""build"" for D&amp;D arguably started when class and race were separated, unless you think of spell loadouts as part of the build. People enjoy that customization in a lot of cases. For those that don\'t, they can play the class they choose exactly as written without much trouble in 5E.', ""I mean the builds really are just the AD&amp;D Kits, just slightly reflavored and not incredibly insane (with some of them being absurdly overloaded, while others reflavor the class entirely, and still others are minor adjustments without rhyme or reason).  So the old man yelling at cloud is yelling at the wrong cloud.  \n\n&gt;To me, it feels way more like a video game than what I was used to from a pen-and-paper RPG. It's almost like you're trying to win the game through the art of character building or something. The PCs are super heroes, the encounters balanced, and it just didn't feel dangerous. It seems like the goal of playing is to continue to advance your character and unlock new abilities rather than unlock mysteries and new dangers.\n\nI mean that's entirely down to your game, not your system.  Monty Haul was coined way back in the day, and was absolutely about advancing characters and unlocking new abilities.    So even the most gnarly of the B/X games could be played exactly like that.  \n\nThe biggest thing that's changed over the years is the idea of a unified structure, as opposed to the clusterfuck of systems that AD&amp;D became."", '""character builds and min/maxing"" are what let me translate the idea I have in my head for a character into the game\'s mechanics. Let\'s say I have a character who I want to be good at, I don\'t know... coal mining. I can craft a backstory with a rich narrative justification for why he\'s good at coal mining. But if he falls flat on his ass every time he tries to swing a pick, it causes a severe disconnect between what exists in the fiction and what actually happens at the table. What you call ""min/maxing"", I call aligning mechanics with narrative - making a character who can actually achieve in the game what his concept and backstory say he can. Role playing is much easier when your character can actually do what the idea in your head says they should be able to do. The concept of ""builds"" arises when you share information with other people about how to put together a character that translates a specific vision to reality.\n\n(Ideally, the rules should make it obvious and easy to create a good character that can do what you want, without the need to consult other people over the internet. 5E is a **huge** improvement over 3.5 and Pathfinder in that regard, although this was achieved at the cost of customization options. Think of 3.PF as giving you a huge toolbox of tiny interlocking pieces, many of which fit together poorly but some of which are amazing in the right combination. 5E gives you a much smaller number of building blocks, which are more likely to fit together in ways that produce something at least passable)', 'Not sure what the weird shot at PbtA has to do with any of this, given that character creation takes about ten seconds and there’s no optimization.', ""IMHO Min-maxed characters are a product of poor game design, not a negative reflection on the player.\n\nWith very few exceptions, all players want their characters to be powerful and do well. Min-maxers are simply players with those same urges and the knowledge of the system to back it up. This is not in any way, shape, or form detrimental to the game experience--nay, it almost always comes from a player who is a big fan. I don't know about you, but identifying your biggest fan players as problems doesn't sound like a good solution to me. And yet somehow RPG players always regard these players as power-gamers and as a problem.\n\nIt's not a problem; the systems just aren't designed to handle veteran and beginner players at the same time.\n\nI can only point to my own homebrew on this one; *Selection* splits your character's health into four different pools--one for each attribute. You improve an attribute, you get extra health for the attached health pool. This means your character doesn't just develop strong skills in your chosen advancement trackways; it means the trackways you chose to neglect become Achilles Heels in proportion to how much you neglected them."", ""I've been pinged by mods before for asking where a thread is going - but where is this going? Do you want to be sold on the style of play? I don't think there is any 'I get this style of play but without actually enjoying it at all' to be had."", 'I feel much the same way that you do on many of these points, but I never played D&amp;D ""back in the day."" I do play classic D&amp;D and retro clones, though, and definitely love the feel of the older games like B/X.\n\nIf you played B/X, you just have to get a copy of Basic Fantasy RPG. It\'s $5 for a paperback and it\'s basically B/X with ascending AC. I would also highly recommend Swords &amp; Wizardry Complete, which is like a reorganized version of original D&amp;D + supplements. There are a lot of players that seem to either settle on Basic Fantasy RPG or Swords &amp; Wizardry Complete for their fix of old school D&amp;D. Then there is AD&amp;D, which is a whole different thing...\n\nI\'ll also go out on a limb and say that you may also enjoy Astonishing Swordsmen &amp; Sorcerers of Hyperborea. That game is more similar to AD&amp;D than B/X, but the crunch that it does have gives it character. And it just oozes swords and sorcery and weird fantasy style.\n\nFinally, I\'ll make a plug for /r/osr here on Reddit. The OSR group on MeWe is even better, though, and it\'s more active. It\'s a nice mix of old school players (people who played in the 70s and 80s) along with younger people who are getting into these games because they like the style.\n\nDon\'t worry, you\'re not alone in feeling conflicted about 5E and modern D&amp;D gaming. That having been said, I\'ve played in some fun and fast-moving games of 5E and some slow-as-shit boring games of 5E.', 'In games without point buy character generation you see it a lot less. The more control players have over their character creation the more you see things either bent towards a preconceived idea or optimized, or both.', ""If you want something more like what you had back then I'd suggest Basic Fantasy RPG, best price at free and feels like a slight update to an old friend."", ""Let's turn your question around: What is it you enjoy about OSR? Why can't you do that with 5e?\n\nMore importantly, there are a LOT of games that have come out since 1e that are nothing like D&amp;D - and aren't clones of it like Labyrinth Lord or Tunnels &amp; Trolls or whatever. Have you played anything OTHER than D&amp;D or it's clones?"", 'Character creation and leveling *are* a bit of a chore sometimes.  There\'s more choices to make now, and 5e in particular is really poorly laid out.  Decent streamlining could probably cut a third or half of that time, but the ones who need it most are the ones who aren\'t familiar enough with it themselves to do it.\n\nCharacter creation started being able to take longer as characters starting dying less.  3e was the big jump in that direction, but you can see it before then, too.  Player\'s Options and such wouldn\'t have flown as well before Dragonlance.  The increased choices are worth the extra time and effort, at least in an overall sense.  If you had an agreeable dungeon master, you always had choices, but that ""if"" is no longer considered a solid first answer, it\'s a second answer  that gets questioning glances and resigned sighs.  The dungeon master, as a general concept, has lost a lot of power and spread more of the various game duties across the players.  As someone who frequents both sides of the screen, this is pretty great.  It\'s easier to get new DMs going, and the time and energy requirements of running a game have come down considerably, making it easier to avoid burnout.', '&gt;\twhat do people enjoy about this style of game\n\nI can really get into studying a complex set of rules and exploring the ways they interact. For some of us, there can be a lot to enjoy in that.\n\nFor me, though, there was a point at which I noticed that about half my RPG group’s eyes glazed over when the other half of us got into that stuff. But the lack of it didn’t cause anyone to disengage. So, I then generally tried to get that fix from non-RPGs instead.\n\nAlthough, since then I’ve come to enjoy it less myself.', 'Think of it this way: there are two kind of creativity in D&amp;D, creativity in play and creativity in design. In old school D&amp;D (my own background as well), typically only the DM really gets to participate in design creativity. One of the ways modern D&amp;D has tried to fix this is by giving players lots of potential paths and character options to think about outside of play. For some players it\'s about game-mechanics optimization. For others it\'s more about creating a background and a character arc that fits with the story. D&amp;D is both a story and a game, people enjoy various aspects of it, and it tends to work best when the various elements are in balance. The design of 5e tends to help facilitate that balance, but you still find some players (many of whom have played too many video games) who want to ""win"" D&amp;D. That said, there\'s just as big a problem on the other side with bad DMs who just want players to mime their novel.', 'Realistically, in terms of combat, both 4e and 5e are much faster paced than 3e/PF; especially 4e. It\'s just that most tabletop players aren\'t also miniature wargame enthusiasts, so they tend to get bogged down by their own creativity or lack thereof, thinking that there\'s a nearly endless amount of choices that they could be making, when in reality, there\'s maybe only two to three appropriate moves or approaches in any given turn, regardless of character composition.\n\nOf course, that\'s probably ultimately for the best, since the most appropriate move isn\'t always the the most fun when it comes to tabletop games. Sometimes, the ""best"" approach is the one ends with a bad outcome, and that\'ll always be true in this hobby, regardless of the system, and regardless of min-maxers.\n\nP.S.

Unoptimized race-class combinaison is not too crippling, so you can favor flavor. etc...\n\n\nHowever there are some really good classless games, or even crunch-minimalists games (for which the rules may be contained in 1 or 2 pages) out there.

(And maybe it's not lazy but traditional or even fun?)",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a5w37t/how_many_times_does_it_all_start_in_a_tavern/,"['I think some of it comes from Lord of the Rings, where they meet Aragorn in the Prancing Pony then go off on a quest', 'A bunch.  My favorite start in a tavern adventure is A Rough Night at the Three Feathers.  Not only does it start at a tavern, the adventure takes place in the tavern.  It also starts throwing hooks right out of the gate which is the solution to the Awkward Tavern.\n\nAnother good one is The Deva Spark.  It begins in a normal tavern and the PCs are shifted into an infernal tavern that then becomes the site of a battle which kicks off the adventure.  Again, throwing the hook at the players as any good introduction should do imo.\n\nThe mistake many new and veteran GMs make when they decide to use a tavern start...or really any ""peaceful start"" is they rely on their players to be proactive.  ""Okay you are all in a tavern...roleplay!""  Players at the start of a campaign are usually better suited to reacting to initial plot hooks.  No matter how much backstory they create and you give them, there\'s an adjustment period to any new campaign.  And then as they get more comfy with their characters and the setting they shift towards being more proactive.  This is also why peaceful scenes can work later on in the game because the characters know more about their characters and the setting.', 'I don’t think it’s lazy. If you’re running a more “adventure” style game where the characters don’t know each other beforehand, I think a tavern is a great location to start out at. In Cyberpunk games, you often meet with your client at a club. Sci-fi games might start in a space bar. It’s a good location to justify a bunch of wandering souls to be in all at once. ', ""The Dragonlance story starts in the tavern called the Inn of the Last Home, it is both a book and a published adventure. You also have Larry Niven's Draco Tavern which launched a dozen different short stories as well as Neil Gaiman's Inn at the End of the World from the Sandman where a number of short stories begin. \n  \nThe Tavern Start (defined as any start in a neutral place where no action is occurring or has occurred.) is a tradition because it ticks the boxes. GMs want to start players in a neutral place with social happenings so they can find their players' voices and mannerisms, they have complete control and agency over their character, and it is a place where people gather in any time period (taverns, cantinas, bars, etc.) often to find work, adventure, or even just to carouse and socialize. Tavern Starts are elegant in their own simple way."", "" Some off the top of my head or that were in arms reach of my desk:\n\n* The Enemy Within (WFRP) starts in a coaching inn.\n* Dragonlance Classics (AD&amp;D 2e) starts in the Inn of the Last Home.\n* Eye of Pain (AD&amp;D 2e) starts in a tavern called the Grumbling Goblin.\n* Wyrmskull Throne (AD&amp;D 2e) starts in the Blue Badger Inn.\n\nMeeting with a Johnson in a nightclub seems iconic so I would look at Shadowrun adventures.\n\n\nMost adventures assume the adventuring party is already together and don't need a meet in the tavern scene. Modern adventures are  probably actively avoiding the trope.\n"", ""I'd say about 25% of the D&amp;D 5e Adventurer's League / CCC modules start out in a tavern. Since there's 8 seasons, and each season is 10-20 modules long, that's a good 30-some adventures."", ""Not sure how many start in one, however...\n\n&gt;  Maybe this trope came from lazy GMs making their own stuff? (And maybe it's not lazy but traditional or even fun?)  \n\nIt's both traditional and fun, even better, it's something that makes sense. The tavern is really the center of social activity in a medieval setting, where more or less everyone of any rank can gather for a drink. I love the tavern intro."", 'I had a GM who we gave crap to all the time about the amount of taverns we would start in. So he starts a Shadow Run game in Seattle. We start in a coffee shop. -_-', ""Tales from the Vulgar Unicorn \nGlen Cook's short stories of misfits (can't find name right now)\n"", ""A lot.  To circumvent this trope, we would pick a random location via dice roll.  Ever start a Heroes Unlimited campaign in a Denny's Bathroom?  I think not."", 'According to adventurelookup.com 219 adventures are tagged with tavern.', 'A friend ran his own campaign and he expressly didn\'t want to start in a tavern, made everyone think of a way at least one person knows another. \n\nFirst session.\n\n""You are meeting in [TOWN] to discuss how to do [PLOT THING] where in town do you meet up?""\n\n- ""Well none of us live here correct?""\n\n""Yea.""\n\n- ""Guess most logical thing is to meet up in the tavern where some of us are probably staying anyway. How many taverns are there.""\n\n""...Only one...Very small town...Fine...""\n\nA tavern is just common ground, it\'s normal for people to meet up there. \n\nA public place where you can get food, drink and a bed if you don\'t set off immediately, unless it\'s something highly covert why wouldn\'t you meet there? \n\nDoesn\'t make it lazy. It\'s a trope at this point, but it\'s still a logical place to meet up.']"

The heroes wont know who it is at first, so she creates supervillains to help move her plans forward.

 

The First is a Villain the starts selling drugs in order to get people addicted, so that the villains drug company ""cure"" will earn her lots of money.

 

The Second is a Villain starts Bank robbing random banks but that's to mask that she is trying to kill off computation for her banks

 

The thread is A villain starts to steal plans from other companies working on secret weapon projects for the government so that she can start making her own.

 

The fifth is a frame job where she sends a villain to make the heroes cause allot of damage to a city so that she can get the heroes look at by the public and government as problems.

Bubulir was just a tiny head, making only high-pitched sounds, on the back of Nekraus\' neck. The Beard of Bubulir was actually the back hair of Nekraus. Yummy.\nOf course, Nekraus &amp; Bubulir rolled a ""Bum"" background. They were getting paid by other dwarves to be beaten.

Made his own custom class as an alpha legion space marine with end level gear and was always ""mysterious"" about whether he was chaos or imperium. Wasn\'t allowed it so made berserker space marine and said he was alpha legion. Spent most of the game thinking he was the bees knees. Kept on trying to betray us. Started making companions to do our jobs for him (understandable since no one likes him for his attitude at the club and we refused to help him on things, and our nurgle medic tried to give everyone diseases) tried to sieze command. throughout the game we did get his slaanesh ass addicted to every drug in the book and killed off several times.\n\n\nRogue trader. Made a seneschal who Beelined straight for power armour, then would never get into combat for fear of dying. Would talk down to the entire crew (except for the rogue trader, he kissed his ass) who half were xenos. His backstory was that he was from the wealthiest family on his planet but half his family were chaos worshippers and his dad tried to induct him so he killed his father and ran. However there was chaos runes everywhere, his dead dad and him nowhere to be found, so the cops deduced he was the chaos worshippers and his family put a bounty on his head. This made a major plotline. Ended up betraying him when he missed a session and got him sent to court.\n\nRogue trader same campaign. New character a min maxed pilot who couldn\'t do shit all outside a ship (useless as we never really did space flight) had a million fate points and again talked down to the crew.\n\nCustom XCOM. Made a 50 year old min maxed pilot when we never flew. Again talked down to us, called us all children and talked about his war story. He got pissy at me when I took the comrade trait to get a buddy who I made my spotter (companion was my characters brother, I was the sniper he was my spotter), said we weren\'t men if we relied on ""bullet shields"" and tried to throw my brother off a roof at a fight he started. Ended up getting his old ass eaten by a chryssalid.\n\nCustom one off fallout. Made a supermutant who woke up with a chivalry comic, called himself Lancelot and used a bumper sword and a car door as a shield. Car door was not bulletproof I repeat car door was not bulletproof. Also made it his characters backstory that he used to raid vaults and kill everyone inside and raid caravans (conveniently I was a vault dweller and another teammate was a caravan merchant). Ended up getting his ass shot through his shield and getting burned by falling debris from the roof of a burning tavern. Also kept on making snide remarks at how I wasnt doing any fighting and that I\'m not a real man (my backstory was that I was from an experiment vault where they put drug addicts in with lots of drugs, so I was a pacifist team medic and mechanic, spent the entire session healing people on our side)\n\nDeathwatch. Made a melee space marine and took equipment designated for other team members (I was the party medic and he knicked my spare diagnoster helmet for the +10 sights, knicked our demolitions scouts explosives cause he said he would blow shit up, knicked my bike, I\'m a white scar, knicked the ultramarine captains iron halo for extra armour, and knicked the psykers gear ""incase the psyker went chaos on us, and cause I have a great willpower I might be able to become a psyker and he can reach me"". Ended up getting half the party killed before we sent him on a suicide mission that we promised he would be honoured for then we jumped ship on him an exterminatus the planet with its Tyranids.\n\nSong of ice and fire. Made a jester assassin who was insane and had enemies everywhere, meant we couldn\'t fast travel anywhere without being ambushed. Tried to assassinate me the heir to our lordship, my bastard brother and everyone we met, didn\'t go into combat with anyone armed though. Ended up getting killed by our overlords men, they were Lannisters, and threw our plans that we had been preparing for a month out the window.\n\nLegend of the five rings. Made a samurai who was a total Nice Guy TM (reflection of his real life personality). Made the party go bad cause somehow he got the decision to either destroy an evil artifact or keep it (we were fighting off bad guys whilst our tank (him) was busy trying to sneak up on the boss and backstab him, we had a ninja why couldn\'t he have done it? That\'s right he got our ninja killed by allying with our assassination target so he could kill him in public, obviously failed and we ran away). Corrupted us with the artifact and started killing my female companions cause they wouldn\'t sleep with his dimwitted fedora wearing ass, (I was the talker of the group and literally a chaste Littlefinger with geisha\'s). Got killed after we threw his ass deep into the badlands with no weapons.\n\nMy custom metro 2033 game. Made an ex spetznaz highly decorated officer who was too old to fight and ordered wave after wave of frightened conscripts at Raiders (conscripts were his own people who only wanted to grow food, who he joined them years ago to stop killing and cause of the death of his daughter), rest of the team was angry with his actions as he did all this. Ended up killing his character off by getting him captured by the Soviet metro station and making him one of the cannon fodder.\n\nBy the way it was a youth group and we were forced to let him play cause we needed to include everybody who wanted to play. Also noone liked him cause his attitude and personality made new members quit and his consistent swearing made kids leave, ended up getting kicked out to allow new players into the group.

And then you think about works of fiction like Firefly and Cowboy Bebop, which seem like sprawling sci-fi with so many locations, but each of them takes place in a single solar system!\n\nThe sheer scale makes a game based on many many star systems (Like Traveller) an utterly daunting prospect, and it is entirely unreasonable to plan every detail in advance if you want to try and match that scale.\n\nWhat I have been doing is to start with standard Traveller Mongoose 1st ed sector generation. This gives you a number of systems an each system has a bunch of stats about the primary world in each system. How big is it, what is the overall climate like, how many people live there, what is the government like, what is the technology level and a few other tidbits. This data gives you some tags about each world that help describe it. For example a low population world with dry climate and little in precious resources will be Poor, where as one with high population and tech level might be Industrial. This gives you your basics.\n\n\nThen what I have been doing for systems I anticipate the players might visit is just a quick thought experiment. Could I run an entire game just in this system? What kind of factions and locations would I need to make it feel diverse? What about just the one planet? What sort of climate diversity would be seen from the baseline and would they make interesting adventure locations? Could you make a compelling plot with these constraints?\n\nYou don\'t need comprehensive answers to these questions, but thinking on the possibilities briefly is a good way to familiarize yourself with the minutia of what you have created and generate some ideas you can pull out.\n\nThen you just sort of watch what your players do. depending on your style of game it is entirely possible they will only get the ""star wars"" slice of each world, a single biome, a single city, unless you force them elsewhere with missions or jobs. This is part of the starfaring life in some games, where flying to new locals is more profitable or interesting than exploring all one world or system has to offer. In this case you can use this information to design auxiliary locations to lure your players too with loot and adventure. But if you find them really digging into the local politics, seeking out interesting locations and factions for fun or profit of their own volition, then you know to be prepared when they travel to a new system.\n\nSorry that this turned into a novel, hope it helps\n\n', ""I find that the Stars Without Number tags are really all I need to generate stuff on the fly.  Using Sectors Without Number to generator a sector is basically the majority of the work.  I only prepare detail for places that I know the players are going to that need heavy detail like if it has a lot to do with whatever developing plot they have going on - the rest is improvised along with some tables and generators.  Having good improvisation tools on hand is necessary imo for a smooth running sandbox game.  Also as you play, you probably have a good idea what the players will do so you can focus your lens of detail in the direction of their interests. \n\nIf you've run sandboxy games in Fantasy, it's actually not very different.  It's just that in Fantasy the scale is usually set and in Sci-Fi it's variable but typically doesn't change once you pick it.  What you want to do is identify what scale the players are currently operating on in the Sci-Fi campaign.  Once you identify the scale, everything falls into place.  \n\nFor example let's say its a Sector Spanning campaign as proposed in the default Stars Without Number - the players have a lot of freedom of movement and are expected to move around a lot.  Here's how I'd compare it to a traditional fantasy game from the GM design side - what level of detail you may need.\n\nSector = Campaign World Map\n\nSystem = Kingdom/province Map\n\nPlanets/Moons/Asteroid Belts/Stations/other areas of interest = City/Town/Dungeon location/Other POIs\n\nSpecific Scenes of Interest = Specific Scenes of Interest.  This level is the most important as this is where the majority of the gameplay takes place and so you add as much detail as needed.  Typically this will just be what is needed for the scene such as a specific floor of a fortified corporate building, a bar, a city block, military installation, etc...

I really like it for miniatures gaming, because it's compact and easy to fit in with all of my other stuff. As you might have guessed, though, it doesn't have a rigid bottom; the leather is the only thing between the dice and the table. In my experience when GMing, the players all want to use your dice tray if you bring one, so it gets passed around a lot and they roll dice into it while holding it elevated because of how cluttered the table can get. I could see that being difficult with this tray, since the soft bottom means that all of the dice try to roll back into the center if it isn't resting on a hard surface. I know that's a very specific downside, but it's relevant enough to my group that I wouldn't use the tray with them.\n\nAs a side note, it's very easy for dice to become cocked on the wooden slats on the sides that help keep the bottom in place, and I have also found RPG players to be somewhat...self-servingly inconsistent when it comes to cocked dice; they generally try to keep good rolls but reroll bad ones (again, in my experience).

rpg,t3_a5sftq,"Black Hack 2e and long term playI'm thinking of using The Black Hack 2e for an open table Barrowmaze game (and subbing in gold for xp).  I love the simplicity of the system and I think it would be perfect for new players.

&amp;#x200B;

However I'm a little concerned about some of the systems and I was wondering if anyone was involved in any long-term playtesting of the game (or has long term experience with the first edition).

&amp;#x200B;

In particular:

1) Since STR appears to be an uber-stat (melee attack and defense rolls), I'm worried that leveling a Warrior for any length of time will make them invincible. I know about the modifier for higher level monsters but it doesn't seem to be enough.

2) I'm worried that the initial simplicity will turn into boredom as the players master the system and then aren't able to grow with the system (developing unique 'builds', mastering as set of abilities, etc...)

3) I've posted here before asking for input about the 2e armour system. It was explained to me that boss monsters would have more hp and therefore would be around longer but the damage immunity system seems like it could be easily gamed against a single boss monster (ie. Each player taking their turn at the fore in combat, taking a known amount of turns of damage immunity). 

4) Barrowmaze has lots of magic items.  I'm wondering if that will severely unbalance The Black Hack.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm considering using Black Hack for a game to which it isn't suited.  Again, kudos to the creator of the system: it is a thing of beauty.  I'm just worried I'll get a month into the campaign and realize I've made a horrible mistake.

&amp;#x200B;",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a5sftq/black_hack_2e_and_long_term_play/,"[""But that's a problem with many simple OSR games. because the focus is on player capabilities rather than PC capabilities, the mechanical depth of the character is limited and so is its growth. That is not an accident but an integral part of the system. Likewise, 'builds' shouldn't be much of a thing.\n\nNow here is what I would do:\n\nSince you seem to be very much into the black hack's elegance just try running it for a while and see how it goes. If you run into the problems you have identified, you can still easily 'retire' the overpowered characters and make them rich cool NPCs about town, convert the rest of the characters to another OSR system you might have identified at that point as more fitting (relatively straightforward process), and continue play.\n\nIf you're still worried about leveling you can adjust the XP caps or gold found to slow it down."", ""I believe you are overthinking this a bit. If you like the look of the game, run it and see how it goes. I don't think many of your concerns are actually going to manifest at the table.\n\nI have played quite a bit of Black Hack, so I'll try my best to address your specific fears.\n\n1) Leveling up stats is not automatic, and it's harder to achieve a high level of strength than you seem to be afraid of. Additionally, high strength does nothing to protect you from any kind of ranged or magic attacks, so a high strength character is still very much vulnerable.\n\n2) This is a concern you would have with any minimalist OSR style system. OSR games intentionally have less crunch heavy PCs to encourage player skill and creative problem solving over selecting an ability from your sheet. Only you know if your players will enjoy this game style or not.\n\n3) Using armour is not automatic in Black Hack 2e, the controlling player chooses whether or not to soak an incoming attack with armour. If all my players tried to gang up with several small attacks to strip away a bosses armour, I would only soak the heavy hitters and let the attacks with low damage die through (ie: Negate the warrior's 4d6 Dealer of Death damage but let through the poke from the cleric). \n\n4) The Black Hack doesn't discourage the use of magic items, though I think it has notes on trying to make them more interesting and unique. There's no reason I can think of that lots of magic items would cause a problem.\n\nI hope this helps. Like I said before, I think you might just be having some analysis paralysis. Just play and if the system doesn't end up being the optimal choice, tell your players you'd like to try something you think might be better and switch. Good luck!"", '&gt; I\'m worried that the initial simplicity will turn into boredom as the players master the system and they aren\'t able to grow with the system\n\nIn my experience with OSR systems, this complexity comes from magic items, hirelings, domain management etc later on. IE the expansions of tools/abilities are obtained during play, rather than with levelling. This is why one of the key issues with converting old school D&amp;D to 5e is the over-abundance of magic items. In old games, magic items were a larger focus of progression.\n\n&gt; Barrowmaze has lots of magic items. I\'m wondering if that will severely unbalance The Black Hack.\n\nSee above. The magic items will typically expand the *options* for the players, encouraging smart execution, but not outright break the challenge ""balance"".']"

rpg,t3_a5pady,"Guide to a non-narrative, self-contained, cyberpunk game?Hey all,

My party and I are mostly D&amp;D players (5th edition at that) and have dabbled in the occasional Call of Cthulhu games but are mostly uninformed about other systems like, GURPS, numenera, Savage, Fate..etc.. which bring me to our current issue:

We decided that it would be fun to try our hand at a different genre like Cyberpunk for a while and we broke off to do a bit of research (Shadowrun, CP202, Eclipse phase, Interface Zero..etc) and the conclusion was that picking the right game was a lot trickier than originally anticipated

The major problem is not really the crunch (we can power through those) but how streamlined/efficient it is to learn a new system. For example, Eclipse Phase is thematically brilliant but it kind of almost hinges on every player at the table knowing the core rules really well - or at the very least being well read in terms of the lore/setting, egos, morphs, etc. On the flipside, a game like Technoir is really efficient in terms of learning the system but...it is a narrative game and that isn't a strong point for some at the table (so we ruled out all games with mechanics like describing adjectives or having positive and negative aspects and the like). The middle ground option thus far is something like Interface Zero, not too crunchy and is fairly easy to pick up if using the Savage Worlds system but..again..not very efficient if you don't have a lot of time to 1): learn the system rules [SW], 2): learn the game rules [I:Z] and 3): build a campaign. It is highly preferable for the game to be self-contained, rules wise, without the extra-hassle of having to delve through multiple books to understand the setting/world. (same goes for I:Z pathfinder edition as we would have to learn Starfinder to make I:Z understandable)

Which leaves us with, according to our count, not much other than Shadowrun and CP2020. Both are self-contained books, high in crunch and with a few thorny issues like Netrunning and the like. The last two points are *not ideal* but it is manageable if there isn't a better alternative. Failing that, we also looked at games like The Sprawl and The veil - they seem like they would be up our street were it not for the mission based PbtA mechanic. Ideally we are looking for something more free form for building custom campaigns. 

Anyway if anyone knows or has any recommendations other than than what I listed that would be super helpful. Thanks so much!

Tl;dr: Looking for cyberpunk game/system that isn't narrative based, ideally with all the resources and mechanics in 1 core-rulebook (not including supplemental) and not too overboard with the crunch.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a5pady/guide_to_a_nonnarrative_selfcontained_cyberpunk/,"[""&gt;Shadowrun and CP2020\n\nThese are probably your best bet, but you might take a look at Corporation or Underground as well.\n\nYou've got such specific criteria, there's not much to offer.\n\nedit: maybe SLA Industries"", 'Maybe cyberpunk2020 \n\nMy sister and her friends have been playing shadow run for years and still say they don’t really know the system all the way through.\n\n Cyberpunk is kind of thickish at first but I’ve never really had that much of a problem with it personally.

Sadly, 5e suffers from some of the worst editing in the industry, which makes it far harder to learn (which is why all that assistance really helps).\n\nHowever, I would say that SR runs very smoothly once you get into the right groove.  If you need any help with Shadowrun, hit up r/shadowrun.  Those guys really know their stuff, and have a boat-load of useful resources."", 'Cyberpunk 2020 is fairly easy to learn, but some of the wonkiness around netrunning and combat edge cases may throw you off. Looking into fan stuff like Interlock Unlimited will help, but then you\'re kind of outside self-contained.\n\nIf you can find it, you may want to check out Ex Machina. It\'s a game from 2005 based on the Tri-Stat system used for BESM. The core book is self-contained (which is good, the publisher didn\'t last long enough to release any supplements), and also includes four settings to draw from, mostly fluff. It\'s out-of-print, but I got my copy on eBay for ten bucks.\n\nAs another far-afield recommendation, if you don\'t mind crunch, consider Cyberspace. It\'s based on Rolemaster, and while it\'s crunchy, the mechanics mostly boil down to a lot of table lookups. Since it\'s less front-loaded and you\'ve said you can ""power through"" the crunch, it might be worth looking at. It is as wonky as Cyberpunk 2020 if not moreso, as a warning, but Rolemaster has its fans and I do think the system has its merits.', ""On the lower end of crunch is Coriolis.  I've been running for a group of space smugglers for 12ish sessions.  It has a lot of the elements of cyberpunk (cybernetics, grungy ships, different classes of society depending on where you are born), and the resolution mechanic is straightforward.  The number of weapons is pretty limited, but coming from DnD 5th it's not much different.  Only thing is the characters are pretty samey beyond skills - everyone is a bog standard human (or have really basic mystic powers).  There are special talents but they aren't too diverse."", 'Shadowrun Anarchy may be your best bet, honestly.\n\nMost of the really good cyberpunk games are gonna fall in that narrative category, like the excellent Technoir. If Powered by the Apocalypse works for your group, though, The Sprawl is excellent.', '**Stars Without Number** is basically (Basic) D&amp;D in space. So most of the systems will be familiar and the tools are fantastic for most scifi genres. The basic version is free, but the transhumanism stuff is in the paid version.\n\nGrab the **Polychrome** expansion if you want more cyberpunk bits to play with. I would probably grab the **Darkness Visible** module too, since espionage suits cyberpunk quite well. But it depends on your tastes.', ""I would say that The Veil is much more freeform in its execution than The Sprawl. The Sprawl is explicitly mission based, but The Veil is based around players creating their characters' beliefs, and challenging/reinforcing those.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously if PbtA games aren't for you, that's fair enough, it may be a bit narrative for your group's tastes, but maybe take a second look at The Veil if you liked it at first glance."", 'IMO, Shadowrun 4e or 5e are good if you strip out the setting and supernatural stuff.  But that will require doing your own setting.  Then again, the only game I have run where I did not do my own setting was “Aquelarre” so I see this as a normal thing. \n\nShadowrun’s rules are solid, a basic core mechanic using dice pools with rules for fighting, hacking, and rigging as elaborations on the base mechanic.  The book is not a page turner however.  On the bright side all of the orc and troll stuff and magic allows you to add genetically engineered trans humans or psychic abilities with minimal reworking.\n\nOn the other hand CP2020 works great without any retooling except that netrunning is a complete drag on the pace of the game.  I say this as a gym that ran CP2020 frequently from 1991 through 1995.', ""If you and your group are, in part, exploring the idea of different systems and the stories they can tell, then there is a hidden value in Cyberpunk 2020's merciless lethality: each of your players will get to try out several characters :)\n\nNo really, Cyberpunk 2020 has a bit of crunch but it's laid out fairly well and after you make one character, making the next is pretty straight forward.  You could ask your players to make several characters, of various sorts, during your session 0.  When they fall prey to the first shotgun they meet in a corridor, out comes the next character, etc etc.  In this way, they'd get to experience more of what the game has to offer.\n\nAs to rules that you may want to homebrew, I'd suggest dropping netrunning (hacking) altogether.  Just make it a skill check.  It's fine.  The minigame is tedious as hell.\n\nAlternate solution, though you're leaning away from Savage Worlds: check out Savage Rifts.  It'll mean buying 2 books, core and SR, but it's a great game, well written, and though it appeals most to nostalgia-scarred Palladium refugees, it still has so much to offer, your players are all bound to find something they like."", ""I'd go for I:Z of Cyberpunk 2020, even if you're not sure.\n\nMy arguments are as follows: Savage Worlds is a fairly easy system to learn, and reasonably crunchy, which should do well for the non-narrative players. The PDF is also fairly well done iirc.\n\nFor cyberpunk you get the original CP vibe without fantasy pollution. The system is fairly deadly and not very modern, but can be worked with. Also, it's on sale at https://bundleofholding.com/presents/Cyberpunk2018 , so now'e a good time to grab it for cheap."", 'In terms of a flexible, mid-crunch system that\'s easy to learn and easy to GM I\'ll always recommend Cypher System.\n\nIt is a generic system, so it will require a little work from the GM in terms of setting and determining which parts of Cypher (mostly which Character Focuses) you want to use. A good starting point for cyberpunk Focii might be:\n\n* Fuses Flesh and Steel\n* Works the Back Alleys\n* Fights with Panache\n* Fuses Mind and Machine\n* Talks to Machines\n* Murders\n* Masters Weaponry\n* Operates Undercover\n* Fights Dirty\n* Works the System\n\nUse a mix of ""subtle"" cyphers and traditional cyphers (drug inhalers, one-use temporary skill brain chips, etc.) Encourage everyone to take the Technology flavor if their Focus isn\'t outright cybernetic.']"

The newest edition of one of roleplaying's oldest games, published by the Chaosium and set in the incredibly rich and detailed world of Glorantha, designed by the late Greg Stafford (who also wrote Pendragon). The mechanics, using the Basic Role Playing system, are D100 roll-under and skill based, and some say outdated, but it plays just fine and is fairly easy to homebrew or substitute in rules variations from other BRP games like Call of Cthulhu. Glorantha itself is a very non-traditional fantasy world based on the interactions between mortals and mythology in a technologically and culturally bronze-age world, and has been supported in the gaming industry for over 30 years with the help of its enthusiastic fanbase.

One very important thing to note is that RQ combat is far more deadly than D&amp;D combat, and the prevalence of limb loss has become a running joke in the community. Though RQG's expanded magic options are aimed towards easing that somewhat, don't expect combat to be a reliable problem solver unless you're some kickass Humakti Rune Lord, especially since your HP will remain static for most of your characters life unless you improve your CON stat directly, a difficult feat, so even high power characters can die to a lucky Trollkin's spear (RIP Rurik Runespear).\n\nCharacter creation is also pretty crunchy, and in my opinion a bit more so than D&amp;D due to the lack of classes and wealth of cultures, occupations, and cults to choose from, not to mention the huge (probably to much so) skill list.

Anyhow, I'm a cleric of knowledge. Original plan was to be much more like Geralt of Rivia (though I'd planned him before playing The Witcher) The idea of a brainy cleric using lore to take on things seemed fun. But with other badasses in the group the unplanned pacifism worked better.

As an example, while bounty hunters came after one of our players (a Roland of Gilead-ish gunslinger) I pretended not to know the gunslinger, tagged along, and loudly proclaimed the value of what the bounty hunters were doing. I've healed enemies (generally underlings) and in doing so made them allies or willing informants. I even took a dangerous substance a powerful man was hunting, acting as a decoy, so the other players could flee because I figured I could talk my way out of it. And of course, lots of scholar stuff and even an exorcism.

rpg,t3_a5mwrs,"""How To Train Your Dragon"" game — Rules for dragonsHello everyone.

I know this may interest very few people, since this is not a system or even an extension of a system, but rather an addition or bonus to an existing system, but whatever. I am already being annoying.

So, several weeks ago, I had this idea to make a HTTYD RPG game, and I went on to look for a system that could handle dragons well and that wouldn't be too complex; one that could deal with both dragons and humans, without switching gears completely between the two.

Turns out, there was a post here, on Reddit, about basically that. Most comments suggested the Fate System — and I have to say, it would work great, using dragons as assets. However, the more I read into it, the more I realized that it was strikingly similar in fashion to another favorite system of mine: the Cypher System. And if I had to choose between rolling several dice or only one, as a player and a GM, I'd rather just roll the one. So, I ended up opting for the Cypher System, making dragons… special.

And here's how this too-long post comes in. I had to incorporate dragons into the equation without breaking anything. So I did. Here's a link to the rules I came up with to make dragons unique and interesting, all the while being simple.

If you end up using it in your own games, please feel free to suggest any modifications you think would make it better/easier.

I hope you try it out, if only so I can have more play-testing feedback.

rpg,t3_a5lm6l,"AMA! We designed The Wyrd of Stromgard, a Norse Mythological Dungeon World Expansion!Hi r/rpg!

We're a two-person team and we're on our last 24hrs of a funded Kickstarter campaign to launch The Wyrd of Stromgard as a physical book.  We wrote, tested, and refined a *ton* of content, including 10 playbooks, 7 compendium classes, adventure campaign, equipment, legendary items, full setting w/ races, GM toolkit, map, and more.

rpg,t3_a5klru,"Don't hate the sorceress, hate the sorceryThe next session of my game is tomorrow evening and I finished tweaking the details last night. I decided that because the sorceress that has been such a pain in the side of my group, hates working for her boss, she was going to flee from him (and therefor the PCs) now that she has completed his latest job. I was going to have her tip off the party as to where the BBEG is holed up as her final act, to possibly show she was not really down with his methods. If the game doesn't switch to another GM after this arc is done, I was thinking of having her involved in the next story and possibly show that she is more a mercenary, than a bastard.

I read over my notes this afternoon and then sent a group message about game start time and received a torrent of  messages about how they cant wait to finally get their hands on the sorceress and kill her. So much vitriol. Now I'm wondering if I should give them a shot at putting her down. Three of them would totally take it and it could stretch this game out; not that it needs stretching out.

Now the hatred is _really_ boiling and they'll live (and show up) just for that final sweet _sweet_ revenge.\n\nThe point here is to present them two options: One which which seems extremely beneficial but frustrates their base desires, or one that's base but totally screws them.

rpg,t3_a5jefv,"Reach of Titan - Free PlaytestHello everyone! My name is Jim McClure of Third Act Publishing, and I'm here today to tell you about our new game - Reach of Titan. The playtest document for this game was just released, and you can get it  FOR FREE with either of the links below.

[Reach of Titan](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/261132/Reach-of-Titan--Playtest) on DriveThruRPG

[Reach of Titan](https://thirdactpub.com/reach-of-titan) on Third Act Publishing

The basic concept of Reach of Titan is you play a group of Titan Hunters. Humans that hunt and kill larger than life creatures in order to feed and defend their village. This is Shadow of the Colossus, meets Monster Hunter, with a pinch of Attack on Titan mixed in. The game revolves around three modes of play: 

* **Settlement Building** - You will not only physically build and expand your settlement with the parts of the Titans you bring back, you will also establish the culture of your people through game play. Over the course of a campaign players will build a village that is uniquely theirs.

* **Hunting** - Titans are a part of the world you live in, and through the necessity of food or survival, they will have to be fought. Every hunt is different, and every hunt has it's own risks and challenges. Each hunt will require the players to risk something personal or something important to the settlement as a consequence for failure. 

* **Titan Encounters** - Epic scale boss battles where the players fight the Titan they have hunted. Each Titan encounter is its own costom experience and the play test document provides you three Titans encounters to get a taste for what the game will offer.

There are many unique aspects to the combat system in Reach of Titan. The encounters are a combination of puzzle solving and traditional resource-management style RPG combat. The game captures that feeling of needing to solve the puzzle of how to defeat each Titan, and then the struggles of climbing the beast and stabbing its weak spot. Did I say climbing? Combat in this game happens in the vertical plane where the battle map is the Titan itself. Encounters are epic fights where some players will be climbing on Titan trying to stab the weak spots while holding on for dear life, others with be using black powder ballistas to anchor the Titan and pulling on cables to disrupt the Titan's actions, and still others will be searching the creature for clues about its origins and weaknesses. 

Overall if you have wanted to experience combat encounters that truly feel like fighting something larger than life, you will enjoy Reach of Titan. This is a game I have been working on for over 3 years, and I could not be more excited to finally get it out in the community. 

I hope you enjoy the game! This is a play test document, so I would love to hear any feedback you have, and I would also be happy to answer any questions about the game.

rpg,t3_a5ik6q,"Advice for running Cortex Dramatic (Smallville)This is more of a tentative post, I'm in a toss up between Wild Talents and this game. I'll probably explain my gripe with Wild Talents in a separate post.   
But yeah, Cortex Dramatic is great at interpersonal drama as far as superheroics go, even in the vein of Daredevil with its cinematic grittiness (Hence Wild Talents is/was on the table). There's just one issue where it falls short. I'm at a total loss of how to manage mooks with the system. Is it just a roll against the trouble pool? A roll against the person in charge of the thugs, in spite of them not being present? 

Obviously, the Netflix shows, the DC CW shows, they all have a proclivity towards a number of nameless mooks being beaten senseless in spectacular fashion, so I'd love to know how to manage it in the system.

Trouble pool can work, as can against their leader, but I’d usually have an isolated group of random thugs as a trouble roll while those operating directly under a lieutenant of some kind would just have his dice pool, partially statted out. I wouldn’t want to go full-fledged character unless the lieutenant is meant to be a notable reoccurring opponent.\n\nUsually thug fights aren’t about stopping the heroes as much as slowing them down or distracting them. So the roll isn’t “do they win” but “do they clear the speed bump in time to engage the villain in hot pursuit” or “do they save threatened citizens immediately or go off to help their friends.”', ""I don't know if Dramatic gives different rules, but both Action and Heroic versions of Cortex Plus have mooks statted up as a small collection of Traits that you can build a die pool with as necessary.

*From Saga Games Studio, the people behind EctoCast: an Actual Play Ghostbusters RPG...*

The world always knew there were monsters under the bed. The world knew there were boogeymen in closets. The world knows there are things in the woods. Things neither human, nor animal. The world has turned a blind eye on these known things.

There is one emotion that can barricade a person’s natural desire to know what’s out there in the world. Fear.

One day something changed. Something forced that fearful world to break down the barricade and fight. Fight or be defeated. Defeat is not an option.

Welcome to the new world of Unbroken.

Join Boris, Sasha, Walter, Nora, and Jacob as they navigate the new world order in this modern urban fantasy setting using the Urban Shadows system.

**Ep 3: Keep Your Cool:**

Hell Is Empty - Part 3:

Nora and Boris engage with mysterious twins with dark powers

Sasha and Walter discuss what happened at the Old Country Estates.

Jacob drives away only to return and find a sight he cannot believe.

rpg,t3_a5fb73,"[System Recommendation] Low magic dark/gothic/weird fantasy for one player and one GM?I'll be running a game soon consisting of myself and one other player. We are going to create a setting together using Microscope and then select a system from there. Fundamentally, I'm looking for a system that can accommodate the following:

* Combat should not be a highly emphasized part of the system. Character progression should not be based on the assumption that all characters are expert combatants who regularly fight and kill evil things before taking their stuff. Games similar to D&amp;D 3.X+ are not as good for this reason.
* The world should feel lethal to the extent that ""kick down the door and smash face"" gameplay is impossible, but lucky crits resulting in instant PC death shouldn't occur either. PCs should be encouraged to take chances, but also rewarded for being sensibly cautious and avoiding unnecessary violent confrontation.
* Roleplaying, negotiation, deception, and solving problems socially should be highly encouraged and rewarded, but that doesn't mean I need a system with lot of social mechanics.
* Low magic, or taboo magic. In other words, magic exists, but the common assumption is that it is the work of occult/demonic forces and open use of magic is tantamount to suicide. Magic can be powerful, but should be rare and mysterious, with few claiming to have and knowledge of it, and most magic must be learned from digging through cursed tombs for cursed tomes or consorting with supernatural entities of questionable intent.
* If demi-human races (e.g., elves, dwarves, halflings) exist, they are viewed suspiciously--elves as druidic murderers who will sacrifice trespassers to profane gods, dwarves as merciless subterranean beings who use captive humans as slave labor, halflings as untrustworthy charlatans with odd and superstitious traditions who have relied on scoundrel behavior to survive. The extent to which any of these rumors are accurate is unclear.
* Most enemies are either humans or corrupted humans (e.g., vampires, ghosts, mad scientists with flesh golems, werewolves, undead). Things like goblins, orcs, and hobgoblins are much less commonplace than in traditional D&amp;D settings and are more aligned with folklore and campfire horror stories.
* The existence of gods is questionable, but not impossible. Clerics who wield divine magic exist, but are looked upon as highly unique, and it is unclear where they draw their powers from. Some believe the magic comes from the gods or whatever local superstition dictates, while others believe it comes from dark forces attempting to trick humans into worshiping them. Skeptics point to the existence of cult leaders who, with sufficient belief, are also able to cast divine magic, despite advocating the existence of false gods.
* Angels and demons are traditionally thought to exist, but are more akin to concepts written about in weird fantasy and gothic folklore (e.g., they rarely appear as corporal entities--often appearing as streaks or bursts of light, flames which disappear suddenly, or masquerading as humans)

With this in mind, I've been looking closely at the following systems:

* **Scarlet Heroes** - At first glance, this looks like it checks all the boxes. It has sensible OSR rules for generating games on the fly, snaps onto other OSR material with ease, and can easily be played in any world or setting. Teaching the system takes about five minutes. Combat is simple as can be and flows easily. It feels like an old school game, but the mechanics prevent PCs from dying unfairly since it is designed for one-on-one play. I don't have any immediate complaints about this one, other than that some might view it as TOO simple compared with something like Burning Wheel.

* **Burning Wheel** - I've heard SO many good things about this game. Combat is short, rare, and lethal, and I've heard the magic system would be excellent for a low/taboo magic game. It has all of the relentlessly intense, character-driven gameplay you could ask for, but without feeling so narrative that the players feel like they are writing the story themselves. The only potential downside is that I've heard the system is extremely crunchy and requires a lot of investment from everyone involved just to get things up and running. I've also heard the system is designed for long-term play, with the shortest campaigns lasting no less than at least 12 sessions. This seems like a lot of up-front commitment.

* **Ironsworn** - I've taken a glance at the free PDF and it looks promising. It seems designed for low magic settings, but I feel like the default setting is so Norse that I'd have to hack things to make it fit more of a gothic/weird fantasy theme. It seems oddly crunchy for a narrative game based off of PbtA, but I'm not ruling that out as a bad thing automatically. I need to do more research on this one.

rpg,t3_a5f3t1,"Pocket Dimension, the RPG you play with loose change. I've iterated on this game a few times over the last 7 years or so, in passing, and every time it's missed the mark.

I designed it with a few things in mind. First, it needed to be simple, dead simple such that you can hold the hole thing in the mind's eye without writing anything down. Second, it needed to feel right, like you're playing a tabletop, not like a narrative RPG or story building game (while those are cool.) Finally, it had to be succinct, short enough to fit on a business card or post-it note, short enough to remember the whole thing after playing just a couple of times. It also assumes the reader already has played tabletops before, a necessary assumption for the feel and length. I considered entering it into the 200 word rpg challenge, but I had it made beforehand and honestly, the other entries are just so intensely creative, this wouldn't have stood a chance. Here it is then, for your enjoyment, perusal, and dissection.

**Pocket Dimension: the ultralight RPG you didn’t know you needed.**

By Matt Gorman and Alex Ryan

&amp;#x200B;

**To determine the outcome of any challenge**, flip 3 coins. This is a Check. Heads are successes, and tails are failures. 1 success will succeed an easy task, 2 a moderate task, and 3 a difficult task. This Difficulty Class (DC,) is assigned by the GM for any given challenge. Optional: Dice also work. Roll high vs low. 

&amp;#x200B;

**To build a character**, choose a talent and a flaw. A talent can be any class, occupation, or descriptor that exemplifies your character’s strengths. A flaw is some weakness or disadvantage. If you make a flip that is related to your talent, re-flip any one failure; for example: a sailor making a Check to navigate, or a gladiator attacking a foe. For checks related to a flaw, reflip a success instead. Choose more talents and flaws to taste. Players have 3 HP, and a DC relating to their talents and flaws (1-3); a wizard might have 1, while a Knight might have 3.

&amp;#x200B;

**To attack**, make a check against their DC. On a hit, one damage is dealt. A monster’s DC, HP (usually 1-3,) talents, and flaws are governed by the monster’s concept. Goblins are spry, and good at stealing, but are weak; Ogres are easy to hit, powerful, and stupid, etc. Take turns, or go with the flow.

rpg,t3_a5c4xw,"System and Resources for a 1st Time GMI've been playing with a group of experienced RPG'rs weekly for the last 12-16 months.  Several of them have GM'd and I would love to try my hand at running a one-shot for my group.  I would like to create an adventure in a low-fantasy setting and with a simple system that accomodates that.  My experience has been with Fantasy Flight Star Wars games, D&amp;D, Shadow of the Demon Lord, and recently Fragged Empire.

Here are my questions:

1. I am the most novice person in my group.  I am intimidated by the vast knowledge of systems and game-specific world content the rest of my group knows.  I'm looking for system that (a) accommodates a low-fantasy setting and (b) isn't too complicated for a first-time GM or too much of an investment for only a 1-3 session adventure.  I thought about running Cypher System.  Does anyone have experience with Cypher and would they agree with that choice?  What system do you recommend?  
2. I am really interested in creating a cool plot and putting the players in interesting situations to interact with.  The world and ""color"" of the setting are really important to me, but I'm not so interested in doing tons of high-level world-building; especially for a simple one-shot.  Is there a low-magic setting that would be easy to pull resources from?  I thought about using Harn World, but after diving in it felt way too large to quickly and easily drill down to the kind of details I was needing for a one-shot.  Does anyone have suggestions?  Maybe Harn would work and I just didn't get source the right information?
3. I love a high-level of production.  If the setting source doesn't provide them - does anyone have suggestions for companies that create those game accoutrements that bring a game to the next level?  Even bespoke stuff would be cool.  I'm looking for to give my group a great experience.  I'm thinking things like maps, restaurant menus, miniatures, etc.

Thanks for any advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a5c4xw/system_and_resources_for_a_1st_time_gm/,"[""Dungeon World isn't the best game, but it's simple, low fantasy, and has an amazing but concise GM guide that will make you a better GM and give you a solid base to build on. Even if you decide on some other game to play (your list of games suggests that the group may not like PbtA much), it's a good idea to read that."", 'For simple D&amp;D-ish play, it\'s hard to beat Maze Rats or Knave. Maze Rats is more its own thing, Knave is compatible with pretty much all D&amp;D monsters, so easy to just grab something from the thousands of D&amp;D-compatible blogs and bestiaries. They\'re both very good for low-fantasy, and assume more of a sword-and-sorcery type thing than modern D&amp;D\'s high fantasy. And they\'re both only a couple of pages long. I\'m running a game with Knave right now and I\'m liking it more than any other D&amp;D-ish system I\'ve ever used.\n\nAfter this, if you end up continuing into a longer term game and you want to get better at GMing, it isn\'t low-fantasy (and it\'s pretty bad for one-shots), but absolutely nothing will teach you to GM better than Apocalypse World. Even if you don\'t end up liking the style of play it offers, it\'s pretty much the only book that gives you *concrete instructions* on how to GM, what to do literally moment to moment (and what not to do). The GM moves in that book are fantastic, as is the system it has for minimal prep and bookkeeping. Note that just reading the book isn\'t nearly as useful as actually GMing it - there are a ton of things that will play differently than you expected just from reading. You need probably around 10 sessions for a good game of Apocalypse World.\n\nSome other observations:\n\n1. Be *very* careful about ""creating a cool plot"". That way lies danger. Remember: the players are not there to act out the script you\'re writing. More to the point: they won\'t. They won\'t go through your plot the way you want/expect them to, and you\'ll be forced to either abandon it or rob them of any agency to keep them on it. Focus on preparing places, and if you prepare ""situations"", make sure they\'re general enough that you can slot them in as necessary, rather than scenes of a plot you wrote. It\'s fine to come up with a few problems, a jumping off point, but don\'t plan the solutions or plan what happens next. The plot is going to emerge organically from what you and the players do at the table. That\'s more fun for them, and it\'ll be more fun for you too - as fun as it is to pre-write plots, it can be boring to GM them since you already know what\'s going to happen. As Apocalypse World puts it: ""play to find out what happens"". You should be almost as unsure of what\'s going to happen, and as excited to find out, as the players.\n\n  If you want to write a cool plot, don\'t GM an RPG - write a short story and email it to your players.\n\n2. Color is good. Don\'t do high level worldbuilding. Do as little worldbuilding as you can. Anything the players don\'t encounter will be wasted, and anything you do ties your hands during the game, often to its detriment. If you do worldbuilding beforehand and a player has a cool idea that contradicts worldbuilding they don\'t know about, you can end up saying ""well actually, you can\'t because you don\'t know this, but your character would..."". And what do you gain from that situation? It\'s almost never more fun than the player\'s plan would have been.\n\n  At the very least, hold woldbuilding ideas very lightly. If any part of your worldbuilding hasn\'t come up at the table yet, be ready to chuck it in the bin if it contradicts something that *does* come up at the table.\n\n3. The best colorful wordlbuilding comes from stuff you make yourself, which is good since most pre-built worlds, in addition to presenting the above problem, are too high-level for actual adventures. You\'ll probably have to come up with something yourself. OSR is a good place to find weirder settings and elements for inspiration.\n\n4. Probably the best high-production object of the sort you\'re talking about is Hot Springs Island. That\'s a good place to start looking.\n\n5. Look up the concept of a ""five-room dungeon"". That can be a very fruitful way to conceptualize basic adventure design. Your adventure might not literally be a dungeon, but you can *think of it as one* and it can make it much less daunting than the openness of just ""design an adventure"". You want to go with something relatively simple (even if the color you add to it is really whacked out and cool) for your first adventure, and a five-room dungeon is a great formula for that.', ""I think you should use a system that you're already familiar with to GM for your first time.\n\nHaving Narrative Dice System experience (FFG Star Wars), Genesys, via Terrinoth, could do this for you."", ""&gt;I would like to create an adventure in a low-fantasy setting and with a simple system that accomodates that.\n\nHow simple are we talking, here?

As with the modern day we know how to use modern machines, but not necessarily how they were made or how they work. They may as well work on magic.  (OK, now I realise my mistake as I'm talking to the wrong audience here as many RPGers will have science and computing backgrounds and *will* know how they work!). In our current world many people don't have various everyday skills our great grand-parents and ancestors further back had. We have become completely reliant and trusting of the new technologies. Take that away (a post-Apocalypse game/Disaster movie/Power outtage on dark, stormy nights in traditional horror) and we become more helpless and vulnerable. Show that our trust was misplaced (artificial intelligence is our enemy/we lose our RPG notes when the computer crashes/GPS) and we feel stupid and betrayed. Long ago we've got rid of the simpler original tools for doing things 'the hard way' that would be really useful as back-ups in emergencies. We might have taken some inadequate measures in case of an emergency/worst case scenario, but we generally learn to cover ourselves much better *after* experiencing the worst case scenario when we've learned what else we need to do or have. In hindsight we regret the mistakes we made that seem obvious afterwards.They could be cost-cutting, lazy temporary fixes or just putting it of for another time). You could think about what your players would struggle with themselves in disaster scenario. They might all feel pretty cocky about one kind of environment and less so about another. Many role-players could be overly confident about their ability to build fires, shelters and to hunt &amp; fish in the wilds and less sure about other environments. \n\nThat's the angle I'd take, which is a bit closer to the disaster movie 'Towering Inferno' &amp; 'Poseidon adventure' sort of a plot. It becomes more like traditional horror if you reduce the action movie elements. You might be sitting ducks. There could be something 'out there'. You're expecting to die, but powerless. It's very dark and conditions are tough. \nMind you, as an RPG you'd want to give them all things to do, which then may make it more classic disaster movie. \n\nI have in mind the **'Out of gas' Firefly episode** and also that old film I've forgotten the name of, where the small aeroplane crash survivors don't realise that they're all dead &amp; ghosts. The very idea of the machines not working has extra impact with many RPGers. We cut some of our phone/computer addicted players off from the internet once for a joke and they went pale! \n\nAnother thought is, not what ticks the horror boxes but which detail ideas creep *you* out as you prep this game. We've seen all the classic horror tropes done to death. You could begin by subverting everyday normality in small ambiguous ways that could easily be dismissed. *It's probably nothing, right?* \n\nYou Tube could be useful here. There are a lot of Top 5/Top 10 spooky video collections and some feature modern technology, such as shop &amp; home security cameras, road &amp; car view ghosts, and that kind of thing. The idea that videos can't lie when there are no human witnesses involved gives it all credence. In an RPG like Firefly, a crew member could be pulling a prank &amp; that could be the PC's first thought, but what if no one was on board at the time?

rpg,t3_a59vfz,"Night's Black Agents / general Gumshoe questionHi,

I got a very warm recommendation for NBA, and I started looking into it, hoping to run a campaign for my regular group.

When looking around, I stumbled upon the [Dracula Dossier](http://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/the-dracula-dossier/) which seems super cool (potentially the-best-campaign-ever-for-my-group kind of cool) yet challenging to run.

I also stumbled upon [One Shot Podcast's actual play of the system](http://oneshotpodcast.com/one-shot/66-dracula-dossier-part-1/), which is GMed by non other than Ken Hite himself, who wrote the system and the campaign. I must say listening to it raised some doubts in me about whether I'd like playing in the system.

My concern is that their gameplay example is for the most part out of character. It's like there almost no RP at all. It goes something like (and I'm NOT quoting):

&gt;\-GM - Do you want to spend a point to find out where the bad guy went?  
\-Player - yes  
\-GM - ok, it's Gumshoe so you automatically succeed when investigating. You flirt with the taxi driver and they tell you so an so. What do you do next?  
\-Player - I'll follow them, and when we get there I'll investigate again...  
\-GM - ok, you find they went there. You follow, and when you get there you (succeed again and so) talk to bellboy and find out they went up to the 6th floor...

While this is not an accurate portrayal of what went on, this is how it felt. Instead of having that player flirt with the taxi driver or intimidate the bellboy, GM just said ""ok, you flirt and it works"". To me this goes against everything I learned and love about role playing games. The players almost never got to play their characters.

I'm worried that Gumshoe's automatic success at investigation kind of promotes this kind of play.

**I'm asking for advice from experienced Gumshoe, preferably NBA players** \- is this something the system opts for, or is it a specific game style that was chosen in this case?I'm asking because I'm seriously considering a large investment of both time and money in the Dracula Dossier campaign, and I'll appreciate any thoughts or advice here.

I want to say that I generally love how One Shot Podcast play games, and I'm sure Ken Hite is a brilliant writer and GM. Also, I only listened to the first episode of that AP (out of four total), so there's a chance I'm jumping the gun here.

Thank you for your time",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a59vfz/nights_black_agents_general_gumshoe_question/,"[""&gt;ok, it's Gumshoe so you automatically succeed when investigating. You flirt with the taxi driver and they tell you so an so.\n\nThis is basically reversed. \n\nThe player would have their character flirt with the taxi driver for information (role-playing however it is that you like to role-play), and (assuming they have at least 1 point in whatever investigative skill the system uses for flirting information out of people) they succeed, and the GM gives them whatever core clues they could get from the taxi driver (preferably in character). If the GM has other non-core clues, they can also offer a spend to the PC.\n\nOr at least, that's how I play it (and it works perfectly fine that way). "", 'I think you\'ll find that Ken was doing 2 things:\n\n1) trying to explain the game to listeners as they played - and -\n\n2) getting past the most basic investigative stuff to where the actual clues lived\n\nHere\'s how GUMSHOE works (from the books, but filtered through memory):\n\nFor core clues: If a player has an appropriate skill and uses in in the presence of a clue in a way that could yield that clue, *they get the clue*.\n\nThat\'s it. Players still have to say what they do, point out how they use their skills to get information. It\'s specifically noted that players just filing into a room and shouting ""Archaeology! Finance! Architecture! Traffic Analysis"" doesn\'t work.\n\nThe Dracula Dossier is possibly the best campaign ever published. Dracula Unredacted is almost certainly the best campaign handout ever created.\n\nRead this: https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsite.pelgranepress.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2013%2F09%2FGUMSHOE-101-for-Players-and-GMs.pdf\n\nAnd consider this exhibit #735 on why APs actually *suck*.\n ', 'Here\'s how I usually balance those things at my table - in this case one of the PCs is at a social function, talking to billionaire  Richard Blaine:\n\n&gt;ME: Does anyone here have the High Society investigative skill?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;STEPHANIE: I do.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ME: Okay, you can use it here to get a clue about the sinister ballet company. How do you approach Blaine? What\'s your angle?\n\nI announce there\'s a clue to be had, and the required skills to get it, the players play the scene, and they get the clue.\n\nHowever! Other GMs do things differently. When I played a game with Robin Laws himself, he made me WORK for the clues with roleplaying. I knew there were clues in the scene, and that I\'d eventually get the core clues, but we started with roleplaying and arrived at the mechanics later. (""Ah! So it sounds as though you\'re using Intimidation to get information from him, is that correct? Okay, he says..."") \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;', ""I think due to the way that the point spending economy works, it definitely runs the risk of turning into that. But there's nothing stopping a group from adding more description (in fact, many mechanics RELY on your players over-describing the cool shit they do).\n\nWhen I ran it with my group, the mechanics didn't make us role play substantially differently than we did in our other games. \n\nWe ran entire campaign in NBA called Blood Money for my podcast Shadow of the Cabal. It's 9 episodes and gives you a good longer-form look at what the game plays like from our groups POV, which is more RP-oriented. \n\n(I really like the One Shot episodes too, I think they are great btw)"", ""Thanks guys.\nThese are the answers I was hoping to get.\nNow all I need are the funds to buy and the time to read ~1000 pages, and I'm all set"", 'Huh. I took a very different takeaway from the Ken Hite sessions. I\'ve actually used the sessions as evidence against the ""cash register"" stereotyping of Gumshoe.\n\nFWIW, I play it that they roleplay first and spend points second. I might drop a hint, but I\'ll drop it in character first and points spends second. For example, they were investigating a house and had the road blocked with a stolen electric company truck. A security agency team (more mercenaries than rent-a-cops) was heading to the house and had to wait until ""the electricity was fixed"" and we roleplayed out the players bluffing the security guys about fixing the downed lines. And the roleplay went really well, the player who was talking to their leader was exmilitary and dropped in all this stuff about where did you serve in Afghanistan--so I dropped ""you get the idea that this guy likes you, is a little bored, and feels like talking. It seems like you might get him to spill more if you keep him going and spend a few points.""\n\nOn the Dracula Dossier in general, I found that you really needed to do a lot of prep between sessions. I\'d ask at the end of sessions what they thought they would look into next and then prepped a relatively scripted scenario based on that. I did not find the players used the actual Dossier much, it was more me dangling two or three solid options and having them choose one at the end of the night. Since there\'s effectively two conspiracies, Dracula and Edom that the conspyramid was not really all that useful.', 'Full disclosure: I haven\'t run a Gumshoe game. Yet. But I\'m currently prepping a one-shot for my players, none of whom have played it either.\n\nSo I\'m going to run Investigation skills like I do Persuasion, Deception, or even Stealth in 5e. Players can\'t announce skill checks. They have to tell me what they\'re doing, and if the situation requires it, I\'ll ask for a check. Players don\'t say, ""I\'m rolling Deception,"" they tell lies, and if there\'s a reasonable chance of failure (it\'s an unlikely whopper, or the person they\'re lying to has reason to be suspicious) I ask for a roll.\n\nSo that\'s how it\'s going to work in my upcoming NBA game. Players can\'t just say, ""I use Flirting."" They\'ll have to actually *flirt*. If there\'s a clue available I\'ll then ask if they have they have Flirting.\n\nNow, there\'s value in flirting in character even if you don\'t have the skill - you might be building towards some kind of relationship with the NPC. It\'s not *all* about clues, after all; it\'s still a role-playing game, and love interests are a thing. And any player can try to intimidate a lackey without the skill, to get past them or deter their activities. But to get the clue, if there is one, you need the skill. And the roleplaying comes first.\n\nDoes that make sense?', ""It's just a GMing style. It's just one GMing style.\n\nKen knows there is a clue that can be revealed through social means so he engages the player that he knows definitely has an appropriate investigative ability. \n\nHe could have been more cheeky about it sure, but asking the player if they want to use a certain ability (and giving them the option to actually decline) is a completely valid style.\n\n"", 'The rules specifically call out that to get a core clue, you need to:\n\n1) Be in a position to get a clue\n2) Have the correct investigative skill\n3) USE the skill\n\nUsing an Interpersonal skill should require some roleplay, in my opinion, but every table does it differently.\n\nThe best way I\'ve found to think about Investigative skills is to treat them exactly like you\'d treat a social skill roll in a more ""traditional"" game, and just assume they succeed in the roll. \n\n\nWould you let a player say ""I use my flirting skill. *Rolls d20* Ok what happens""? Probably not. Treat it the exact same but just remove the roll.', ""I think others have answered it straight from the Gumshoe rules, so I won't repeat that. To me, the gameplay comes down to a similar choice in style to games (like, say, White Wolf) that mechanize roleplay-centric skills. \n\nIE, by the rules in a game like that, you only need to roll Etiquette/Socialize/Bureaucracy/etc to succeed. But if you play it strictly by the book, then there's no actual reason to roleplay out any scenes where someone would be using those skills. Gumshoe works in much the same way; even though the skill determines the ultimate outcome, you/your group make the choice on whether the roleplaying is also involved.""]"

rpg,t3_a59a1o,"Chuubo - How does Session 1 look? [CWWGE]I've been trying to wrap my head around this game and I'm struggling to say the least. I think I understand the basics: character creation, quests, arc, emote action, etc. I'm curious at how others have started up a game with a new set of players, especially from the perspective of the HG (GM) player. Gather everyone, create characters, chose quests, arcs, genre... then what? 

What does the HG need to bring to the table? A location for the game to start and some NPCs and let the characters do what they want from there? Do I need to create potential conflicts and obstacles? Is there something more specific needed to actually kick the players into following their quests?

Any experience with this from someone who has been an HG would be much appreciated

rpg,t3_a599rb,"What makes a good Starter Box?As my RPG Freelancer approaches production (shamless plug, couldn't help it :P), I have been tasked by my company with creating a starter box for the game. While I own the latest DnD Starter box, I have always been more of a dive in head first type of gamer, who just gets the books and starts making my own stories in the world.

So, I am researching starter boxes and figured that I should reach out and ask the greater RPG community - what makes a good starter box? When you order one, what do you want to see? What type of things ruin a starter box for you?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a599rb/what_makes_a_good_starter_box/,"['The issue with beginners boxes is that they have alot on their plate. they need to be cheap enough to merit purchasing instead of the core rules, be complete enough that it feels like your not being shorted or tricked,and leave enough out that purchasing the full rules should feel like enough of an upgrade to merit purchasing it. they also need to balance being a reference for play and a learning tool.\n\nThe big thing that starter sets often miss is that they aren\'t a complete enough experiences and they aren\'t good enough learning tools. If i give this to a child for christmas they should be able to learn to play the game on their own, and they should be able to pull the game out for more than two sessions without needing the full rules to continue playing. I also shouldn\'t have to purchase extra things to play the game. If I\'m a poor family, Ishould be able to purchase the starter set and not feel like I\'m cheating my child. It should feel like a complete board game with missing expansions.\n\n-------------------\n\nOn to content In my opinion a starter box should have:\n\n* a booklet with a functionally complete copy of the play procedures. It should cover all the possibilities of play.\n\n* pre-generated characters. At a minimum it should be enough for a full party(6?). If you include enough of these (12+?) then you might be able to get away with leaving out character creation stuff from the included rules. If you don\'t include enough, include a booklet basic character generation rules. you don\'t need a ton of options but it should suffice for play.\n\n* A functional setting booklet. don\'t just give fluff. give a starting town, a usable map of the surrounding area. this should be gameable content. You don\'t have to include the whole world but enough to game in a smaller starting setting.\n\n* either dice or chits(see the holmes basic box) for random number generation.\n\n* 2 short adventures. the first should be a ""learn to GM/play"" adventure. see the one included in the dungeon masters rulebook from the *Mentzer basic box*(probably the best starter set) for an example of this done well. the second should be a replayable adventure with rules for variation and adaptation - see *Broodmother Skyfortress* for an example of this style. these don\'t need to be long and massive tomes like curse of strahd or Broodmother Skyfortress, but having both styles vastly improves the quality of the box.\n\n* Blank grids if your game uses grids. either one laminated sheet for use with a dry erase marker (included if possible), or multiple unlaminated for use with pencil and eraser (include each). If the game calls for a grid and you don\'t include one then it feels incomplete.\n\n* booklets instead of books. *BX essentials* is a great example of how to format your content for inclusion in a beginners box.\n\n* It should come in a box large enough to store a bit more than just the included contents. I should be able to toss in extra dice, an extra adventure, character sheets etc.\n\nI don\'t think I missed anything. that is my platonic ideal for a beginners box. ', ""This depends pretty heavily on the game. \nIt's important to me to be able to open the box and play an entire adventure with no prep (or the PC's and GM prep at the same time - GM reading the map while PC's pick equipment etc). \nDepending on the game, this means including maps, pencils, character sheets, dice, a brief rulebook, everything you'd need to sit down and play.\nSecondly, it has to teach the game while you play it. Short adventures are fine for this, and if well written they can be a tutorial as well with some suggested actions based on what characters have been chosen.\n\nBasically, a bad beginner box requires me to know how to GM or how to play, or requires me to own other things (dice/maps/a printer), in order to spend an evening learning the game with friends. \n\nAlso, make sure the adventure included can be replayed. This just adds value to a beginner box. How you accomplish this depends on your game. "", ""The 5e starter box is ok, but I'd really have liked it better if it included some tokens and especially a poster map or two. The 4e essentials starter box was brilliant. \n\nJust the basics: basic rules, pregen characters, a good starter adventure, dice, and if possible/applicable, some basic table accessories like maps/tokens, player handouts, action/item cards if your game uses them, and of course a blank character sheet for copying (although these days you can also just put a pdf on your website)."", 'For me, the following does it:\n\n* Short Rulebook\n* Pregenerated characters\n* A separate adventure book\n* Dice\n* Pencils\n* Blank character sheets\n\nBeyond that, it really depends on your game.', 'It should have everything you need to get started and have fun.', 'The box itself needs to be the proper size and sturdiness to fit my two fat cats.', 'At a minimum, a good starter set lets you make a character rather than having to use a pre-gen, even if the options are limited.

Now is a great time to get in on the system!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a58srw/shadow_of_the_demon_lords_latest_kickstarter/,"[""Here are some of the cool things Schwalb has previewed so far:\n\n**Demon Seed**, *Demonology Attack 3*\n\n&gt; You take 1d6 + 1 damage. You flick a glistening dollop of liquid at the target. Make an intellect attack roll against the target's Agility. On a success against a living creature, the liquid strikes the target and is absorbed into its body.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the end of each round, the target must make a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, the target takes 1d6 damage as its belly bulges out until its flesh begins to tear, weeping blood and gore from the fissures. If the target gets three successes, its belly deflates and a river of corrupted fluids flows from its body for a few minutes. If the target gets three failures, its belly bursts to release a tiny demon in an open space within 1 yard of it. The target takes 3d6 damage and gains Insanity equal to its Will score.\n&gt;\n&gt; The demon acts according to its nature, takes the next available turn and remains until it's destroyed.\n\n**Deviant**, *Master Path*\n\n&gt; Deviants exult in their depravity. No evil is too great for them not to indulge their desires and the pain and suffering they create simply heightens the pleasure they experience from surrendering to their vilest impulses. For deviants, Forbidden magic is not a means to an end, but rather it is an expression of their true nature and their ability to share themselves with as many people as they can.\n\n**Stalwart Defender**, *Summoned creature*\n\n&gt; Answering the summons, the stalwart defender appears in a flash of light that gathers about its giant humanoid form as armor. Wielding a bar of molten steel, it lurches after its summoning, swinging its helmeted head this way and that, always searching for the enemies it was called to fight. The stalwart defender proves resolute in its efforts and any who would seek to harm its master must pay a price in blood.\n&gt;\n&gt; A stalwart defender does not speak, though it seems to understand the spoken commands of its summoner.\n\n**Manikins**, *Alchemy Spell 3*\n\n&gt; When you cast the spell, you must concentrate for up to five minutes. For each minute you spend in concentration, you shape one compelled tiny construct from the target clay. The construct remains until you cast this spell again or the manikin is destroyed.\n&gt;\n&gt; While at least one construct remains, you can use an action to perceive from the space of one construct that is within long range. While perceiving from the construct's space, you are blinded and deafened in regard to the space you occupy, but you can see and hear normally from the construct's space. You can use a triggered action at any time to end this effect.\n&gt;\n&gt; **Sacrifice** You can use an action and expend a casting of this spell to cause each manikin created by this spell to explode in a 1-yard radius centered on a point within the manikin's space. The manikin takes damage equal to its health and everything in the area takes 1d6+1 damage from the flying debris. A create can make an Agility challenge roll and take half damage on a success.\n\n**Utter Ruin**, *Forbidden Attack 9*\n\n&gt; The target becomes immobilized for 1 round. If the target is blinded, you remove the blinded affliction from the target.\n&gt;\n&gt; The image of someone or something the target loves appears inside an open space you can reach. The spell makes the subject appear to be killed or destroyed in a graphic and despicable manner and then the remains of it fall to the ground under the space.\n&gt;\n&gt; The spell amplifies the target's emotional reaction, forcing it to make a Will challenge roll with 3 banes. The target gains 1d6 Insanity on a success, or 3d6 Insanity on a failure. If the Insanity would cause the target to go mad, a blade appears in the target's hand and the target uses it to cut its own throat, which causes it to take damage equal to its Health.\n\n**Nightmare**, *Master Path*\n\n&gt; The power offere dby dark magic can entire anyone to discovering these filthy traditions. Among those who succumb to the temptations, those in possession of latent psychic abilities find they can use the secrets of evil magic to augment their mental faculties, often to deleterious ends for individuals who cross them. Nightmares describe just one example of how such figures might meld the forms of magic they have discovered and they use their gifts for sinister ends.\n&gt;\n&gt; Armed with the ability to reach into the minds of others, nightmares call forth their victims' deepest fears and amplify them to the point that the affected cannot do anything but grapple with the terror building inside them. As nightmares grow more powerful, they can transport their victims' minds into a wakening dream in which the fears that plague them become all too real.\n\n**Time Gate**, *Time Magic 10*\n\n&gt; Light bends and warps inside the area. You must concentrate for 1 hour, during which time you fix in your mind on a point at any time in history. A the end of every 10 minutes you spend in concentration, you must make a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane, taking 1d6 damage on a failure and gaining 1 Insanity. If you finish, a portal opens inside the area and remains open for the duration. The portal has a front and a back, but does not have sides. Peering through the portal reveals whatever is on the other side of it, but at the time you specified. You and any creature from your time can pass through the portal and back again for as long as it remains open. When you pass through the portal, you remain in the same location, but at the time you specified.\n&gt;\n&gt; Aftereffect. You must make a Will challenge roll with 5 banes. On a failure, you gain Insanity equal to your Will score.\n\n**Edgewalker**, *Master Path*\n\n&gt; All magic bends the rules, but certain traditions bend them to the point of breaking. Time magic allows a caster to alter the flow of time and travel. through it, while Teleportation closes the distances between points to allow speedy and sudden transit. Students of either tradition gain great versatility, but those who seek to master both find themselves at the precipice where reality ends, able to go anywhere and at anytime they choose. Such casters gain the moniker Edgewalker, since they walk the narrow path at the edge of all places and all times."", 'The stretch goals are what I really want.

I was wondering if anyone had on hand some OSR/system agnostic write-ups for some sort of small village full of cute, quirky and likable characters.

rpg,t3_a54x0x,"My weekly RP is falling apart and I'm not sure how to solve it.Yesterday my monday group and I finished our 6th session of Blades in the Dark. It was one of the worst rpg sessions I've ever played, and it has made me question both my abilities as a GM and whether or not I'd like to continue the hobby at all. I went into the session hoping to relieve some stress, and I ended up more stressed than when I first started.

So, in order not to waste your time, I'm going to list all the things I think went wrong, and go into detail on each one separately.

1. **I hate and love prep.**

I love prep, I love describing an environment, a machine, social or otherwise, which the players then go in and break. But I hate prep, I hate spending an hour in front of the computer writing, after spending 8 hours at work.

2.  **I can never get what to prep right.**

Because I both hate and love prep, my strategy for prep is not to prepare everything but to fill 1 A4 sheet with any information which is relevant to what the players are doing, and dammit I'll improvise the rest. If a particular aspect of the environment strikes my fancy, I will go in depth on it and write passionately about it, before putting a summary in that sheet.

But it doesn't always work out. For example, I knew the players were going to war against a particular faction this session, and they did. So as part of my prep, I spent an hour going in depth about this faction and its underlying philosophy and method of combat. But the players didn't inquire about the faction, at all. Also, they were making the first move, so I didn't have the opportunity to use my knowledge to react. So that was an hour of prep wasted.

Instead, I got caught on one foot when players began asking basic questions like ""Can ghosts be invisible?"", ""Where do I get ghosts from?"", things which I should know but I don't because the rulebook doesn't say anything about them, or if it does, it's fragmented. These are also things which were not important before, so I didn't flesh them out. So, I improvised, and ended up going into a pointless discussion about whether or not ghosts being invisible is too op.

Speaking of pointless discussions...

3. **The player's plans lack cohesion and they spend too much time discussing them.**

The whole reason why I switched to Blades in the Dark was because of the flashback mechanic. Unfortunately, my players don't use it. Which would, in general, be ok. But I feel like they spend too much time making plans and not enough time executing them. They're shadows and  their reputation is based on subtlety, and that's fine. But I feel like their plans lack focus.

As an example, they wanted to raid a drug den and poison all the inhabitants. But for some reason, the whisper just had to throw a ghost into the pot. They had a fine plan up to that point, they didn't need to add another element, but once someone brought the ghost into the picture, they just HAD to use it, so they spent another 15 minutes trying to ham it in, and it just got weird.

Which brings me to:

4. **Too much going on at the same time.**

Blades in the Dark is a fine system, I remember my excitement reading through the rulebook from cover to cover, reading every rule and going ""Wow..."", reading all the wonderful lore and getting drawn into the world.

But I don't like engagement and overindulgence rolls.

Every failed engagement roll, or overindulgence roll, I feel like I have to add a new element to the plot in order to justify the failed roll in the environment.

Even without these mechanical elements, I have a habit of complicating things. I get excited about the possibilities of something the players do, and I make the environment act accordingly.

* If through the players' actions a seat in the council is opened, then powerful people will try to fill that seat.
* If a rival starts gaining momentum, then they will go up a tier and start becoming a bigger threat to the players.
* If the players are allied to a hot headed gang leader, and he challenges someone else to a duel, then there's a possibility that the players will get embroiled.

I used to think that it's a sign of a good GM that he makes the world feel alive, and reactive to the player's choices, but it just has become this soup of loose threads, which the players are desperately trying to tie to their advantage, which further fuels their long discussions.

It's honestly tiring, everything's tiring,

5. **We're all tired adults.**

And maybe this is the big one. I moved the session to monday evening, because I felt monday is the least offensive day of the week, the one that people could most likely commit to. But rping after a day of work is not easy. Not for me, and not for my players. I love my sessions when they go great, if I could I'd gm every day, but I need time for prep and rl. When things go well, I feel refreshed and I feel like I can take on the rest of my life. When things don't go well, like yesterday, then I just feel tired and hopeless.

TL;DR: I feel like my RPG is falling apart, and I'm not sure how to solve it. The biggest problems I feel are my lack of quality prep, and the fact that my players and I tend to over-complicate things. Any advice on how to proceed would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

**Update**

I'd like to thank everyone who took the time out to comment. It was definitely a boost for me to get so much support from the community.

\---

Thank you to the people who shared their own experiences of trying to balance life with their hobby. That meant a lot, and a lot of very good advice was given. Ultimately, I think we all agree that even though it's hard sometimes, nothing beats the payoff of a good session and the stories that emerge from it.

\---

As many people rightly pointed out, my group doesn't really have much experience in PbtA. We are, most probably, not playing blades correctly. I am the only person in my gaming circle who has played PbtA games, and I have always GMed them. The primary reason I switched from Savage Worlds to PbtA (Originally, Dungeon World) is because I liked the idea of coming up with enemies on the fly. This lack of player experience is a problem, and to be honest, I've been pining to get into the player's seat again for a while now. Maybe it's time I looked for a game to join.

I'm going to experiment with the timer for planning, to see how it goes.

\---

The advice on prep is spot on. I can't count the times my passion for world building has come back to bite me in the ass. Maybe, I'll find another outlet for it, because this is not the first time I got burnt out because I wrote a wikipedia page's worth of information about a culture only to use .2% of it. I always used to think, ""Hey, if I like writing it, isn't that a reward in of itself?"" but that's obviously BS, I think deep down I always expect something I've written to be used. I think I need to prep less, and involve the players more in the world building. Do more of it at the table rather than off the table.

I'll start experimenting with preparing situations eventually, but I think for now I'll try limit my prep time to 30 minutes just to see how it goes. 

\---

As for the players? I have 4 players. One doesn't like the slow pace and has been very vocal about it. One loves the slow pace and has specifically said he doesn't like the flashback mechanic. The other two just love roleplaying, so they're happy with whatever rule is enforced. It is always a sore point for me when I can't give all of my players the experience they're looking for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a54x0x/my_weekly_rp_is_falling_apart_and_im_not_sure_how/,"['Well, it sounds like your group (and I’m not being mean, but yourself included) aren’t using the system right.

Lurk, recovering that wasn\'t fun, but it pays off as the key smoothly *snicks* into the lock on the gate that leads up out of the sewers and into the manor. A flight of stairs and another door later, you\'re all huddled in what looks like a small larder. In the next room you can hear what sounds like a couple of the kitchen staff gabbling with each other. You\'re in, and the manor is none the wiser.

(If you\'re not sure--ask them!) \n\nWhen I first started running Blades (heck, when I first started to run *any* new system) I had sessions that I *assumed* the players didn\'t enjoy--because they were uneventful, or overcomplicated, or too ""hard""--that they, in fact, *did* enjoy. \n\nIf the players aren\'t having a good time, then obviously something isn\'t working, and it\'s okay to admit that and try something else (different game, different GM, different table, et cetera). But, if the players *are* enjoying themselves, and *you\'re* not, you need to examine why. \n\n&gt; So as part of my prep, I spent an hour going in depth about this faction and its underlying philosophy and method of combat. \n\nThat\'s a whole heckuva lot of prep for BitD! Like, way, *way* too much. What did you feel you needed that wasn\'t already hinted at in that Faction\'s core book write-up? If part of what you like about GMing is doing *lots* of prep and then having that prep payoff at the table, Blades might not be the right game for you. \n\n&gt; But I feel like they spend too much time making plans and not enough time executing them. \n\nI think new Blades GMs (myself included) often have this issue. The solution is to use some **hard framing**. As soon as the PCs have provided a plan with a detail, you use your magical GM powers to smash-cut to the score as it starts. When your players complain that they didn\'t have enough time to prepare, you can gently remind them that flashbacks are a thing. \n\n&gt; They had a fine plan up to that point, they didn\'t need to add another element, but once someone brought the ghost into the picture, they just HAD to use it, so they spent another 15 minutes trying to ham it in, and it just got weird.\n\nThis sounds like you\'re unhappy with your players\' playstyle. You want them to be efficient and logical, and they want to screw around a bit. If this is really an issue for you... well, you might have difficulty GMing *many* games. To me, ""PCs do something stupid"" is both an inevitable and *desirable* thing in *any* RPG.\n\nThat said: Are you portraying the world honestly when the PCs goof off? If they have a silly, nonsensical, or dangerous plan, do you hit them hard if it fails? If the players push the boundaries of what\'s possible in the game, and they encounter no resistance, they\'ll keep pushing.  \n\n&gt; The biggest problems I feel are my lack of quality prep, and the fact that my players and I tend to over-complicate things. Any advice on how to proceed would be appreciated.\n\nGeneral Advice: Talk with your players to see how they feel about the game. Determine if the problems you see are everyone\'s or yours alone. If you\'re unable to align your interests with theirs, change the game/GM/table. \n\nBlades-specific Advice: Embrace improvisation. Prep *less*. Realize that elements of Doskvol are meant to be invented at the table. (Deciding, in an instant, that ghosts can be invisible is *totally fine*. Fairness be damned--Blades is a game about underdog scoundrels struggling to survive in a haunted-ass city.) ', 'If a player asks about ghosts, you have a group conversation about what ghosts should be on your collective world; not ask the DM for ruling on “mechanics”.\n\nOverall, your post reads like a group of players trying to play D&amp;D in game that doesn’t support it.', ""don't prep so much.\n\nworld building is great if you're building your own setting, but other than that, make a few main characters, a half dozen hooks, a few possible twists, then just improvise from there.

But I feel like they spend too much time making plans and not enough time executing them. They\'re shadows and their reputation is based on subtlety, and that\'s fine. But I feel like their plans lack focus.\n\nThis is on you and them.  Gotta push them into making super basic plan structures, then grab the dice and roll engagement.  If they can\'t settle on anything, try to figure it out...  ""Okay, that sounds like deception... what\'s the detail?""    Make them give you one piece of information...the questions prompt you into it.  To play Blades, you REALLY have to take in that mentality.  As soon as they give you the detail, roll the dice...and then you\'re the spotlight.  I always tell me players, ""Okay, the camera pans back to you...""  or ""You have a second, a heartbeat, to do something while this other stuff is happening"" or ""You\'ve still got the initiative here, want to use it?""    The GM sets the pace with Blades...you push them along.  Don\'t tell them what to do, but constantly ask them what they\'re doing.  It\'s a really hard style to get right.\n\nAbout flashbacks...  at first, you gotta offer flashbacks, a lot, until they get used to using it.  And if they don\'t, you keep pushing them until people take consequences, traumas, or die.  Then you mention how a flashback might\'ve helped.  And if they still don\'t want to use flashbacks, it\'s probably time to play a different system because they aren\'t too into the mentality of Blades.', ""Could you describe, in a rough outline, how you want a session to go that would be enjoyable or at least satisfactory for you?\n\nWith the monday thing - it sounds like it's driven by 'We all have to play together - we can't leave out X and Y who can't play on a saturday/sunday/a day that isn't nuts for the rest of us!'?

Take a break, let someone else run, play something else, etc.  You may need to de-compress a bit more before jumping into the game..."", 'Everyone\'s ragging on you for not playing BitD right and they\'re probably right, but man I don\'t blame you. I mean who gets interested in a Heist game that doesn\'t like planning? I shouldn\'t have to force my players to stop getting excited over an aspect of the game they\'re getting excited over. Then when I do finally get them to stop planning and jump into the action, they feel cheated every time they come up against a challenge they wanted to plan for. Oceans Eleven proved this flashback business is fun to watch, but my players didn\'t show up to role-watch, they showed up to role-play.\n\nThen everyone acts like it requires minimal GM prep and and improv is enough to run a session because of the whole PbtA thing where players can fill in the blanks. Yeah, you can ask your players ""ARE ghosts invisible?"" and it takes some load of you to offload world-building, but what about Score building? When my players decide to smuggle someone out of the city hidden in train freight, how do I run that without prep? I\'m a city boy living in 2018 I\'ve never even been in a train station. I can\'t pull out of my ass how security and customs works for loading cargo onto a Victorian freight train. So they wait in some TSA style line because that\'s all I can think of and when they get to the security officer that they WANTED to bribe to begin with but couldn\'t because that\'s too much planning, now they get to do a flashback where they bribe him... but they fail. They failed to bribe him in the past so WHY THE FUCK are they in this line!? Don\'t even get me started on the abstraction of Coin and the entire ""big picture"" game.\n\nWhat I\'m trying to say is that maybe Blades isn\'t right for you, but without the subtext that Blades is some kind of well-oiled pinnacle of role-play that you must be an idiot for failing to run. Even for a group that\'s a better fit, Blades is freaking exhausting to GM. All PbtA is. It demands a lot more than I\'d be able to offer on a Monday night after work.\n\nAs far as planning - and I\'m saying this in the context of any system - do you actually read the text you wrote down during the session? Maybe try prepping more in your mind. Imagine the characters and environments and their plans and motivations and whatnot ahead of time, but don\'t spend the time writing out so much. Flash cards or a bullet-point outline are probably enough.', 'Tbh it sounds like you overthink everything.\n\nYou don\'t need a backstory for everything, and you don\'t need to plan everything out either.\n\nWhen the players ask ""Can the ghosts be invisible?"" you should NOT answer the question.  The players have never seen a ghost, who are they even asking?  For all they know, ghosts don\'t even exist.\n\nAs for you, if ghosts are in your game, whether or not the PCs can see them is definitely something that should have been prepped before hand.\n\nMy suggestion is to plan out events that are supposed to happen but do not limit each event to a specific time or location.\n\nFor example, the players are looking for a hidden treasure in an ancient temple.\n\nDo NOT lock the location of the temple only to the NW corner of Forest BlahBlah.\n\nLet them walk around a little bit, throw some small encounters at them, and then smoothly introduce the temple to the game.\n\nThe temple doesn\'t need an advanced backstory either.  Either make something up on the spot if they ask or have a very simple summary about it.\n\nYou can do this with pretty much every encounter too.  When you draw encounters out of your ass you can actually write tons of material and have the players experience all of it too.\n\nThey can\'t accidentally miss your encounter if the encounter itself can be used anywhere.', 'Can you find another group to play with, perhaps? I don\'t mean abandoning your regular group, just sit in with some other people to get some perspective and inspiration. I find I am never so stoked to GM as after I\'ve been a player for a while and seen how somebody else does it.\n\nAs for the noble art of improvisation, I think the best advice I ever got there (and it may be old news to you) is ""don\'t be clever"". The most obvious approach is often the best. Are ghosts invisible? Of course! They\'re ghosts. The players are not gonna punish you for being unoriginal and relying on tropes, because that means they know what they\'re dealing with and their own creativity can bounce off it. ', ""Great advice so far on Blades, but maybe you should try and play a different game. One with less moving parts. Sometimes a game just isn't working and you need to pull the plug. Reset the energy, get the funk out.\n\n**For prep:**\n\nwrite down some blocks of antagonists, interesting locations, items, puzzles, or cool encounters. Don't tie anything down to a location (do just like @RabbidCupcakes mentioned). If you're curious at an example, check out 'Oath of the Frozen King'.\n\nOr pick a game and setting that's easier for you to improvise (ex: zombie apocalypse), or some TV show or fiction you really like. Something you feel you have great command of.\n\n**For player planning:**\n\nThink like the military. Have players choose a leader. The leader makes the plan, period. You can switch elected (or random) leader in intervals if you wish. But if players are having choice paralysis, then like any company or government, you need a strong voice that can move things along.\n\nHope some of this helps!\n\n&amp;#x200B;"", 'So I connected with this a bit because I also play on Monday nights and have players that spend too much time planning, with, of course, everyone distracted by real life.\n\nThe big thing I’ve noticed is that a few of the players in my group only want sessions to be 2 hours MAX. So between that and how much time they spend planning, we can end up with sessions that contain a single significant event. Also sometimes no one even engages with the GM, and you end up with a totally silent party in response to everything.\n\nBut honestly, what I’ve decided is that I love playing RPGs. I will continue to do it in whatever form I can. Do I wish I could do the epic 5-hour long sessions I did in high school? Absolutely. It was a blast. But this is what real life allows me now, so this is what I’ll do.\n\nAs a side note, it really seems like the system you’re playing is not for you or for your players. If I were you, I would run a module/adventure path. It doesn’t disallow prep work, because you can add stuff to it if you want. But if you get a good one it can remove the troublesome aspects of the stuff you absolutely need to prepare.\n\nSome prep work will ALWAYS be wasted. No matter what.', 'Hey, sorry to hear it\'s so stressful. You can always fold the game and be honest with people. Just let them know that work\'s kicking your ass and it\'s making it hard to come home and then prep for a game.\n\nIn addition:\n\n\\- Offer to let someone else run.\n\n\\- Switch to boardgames for a while! Keeps the group alive together and there\'s a lot of roleplay-ey boardgames out there. If you keep the group alive, you can pick up the game at a later time.\n\n\\- Don\'t be so hard on yourself. Being a GM is a lot of work and sometimes players are more in it for ""what can you do for me"" rather than working together on stuff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as what to prep, take your queues from the players. If they\'re always dropping a ghost in there and seem interested in that aspect, bone up on all that part of the game. If they are going to war with a faction, get the basics down and improv the rest, taking notes. Only flesh it in once you know what hook their going to bite on.  \n\n\nI\'m a graphic designer and sometimes, instead of spending 20 minutes on making concepts for a logo, I can do 10 times the concepting by just using a pencil and paper to sketch. The clients only going to pick one to refine into the actual logo so the rest are going in the trash...therefore, I don\'t need to spend that much effort on them in the concept stage. I just need to get the concept across and refine once I know which logo they\'re going to bite on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother thing is to modularize your story and prep. If you spent a lot of time on a big combat and it seems they\'re gong to avoid it, no problem! Table it, use it later in a repackaged way. If you have a story hook (a note or something) and they bypassed it, put it somewhere else!\\\\\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck!', ""I had a similar issue a while back. Try planning for shorter sessions. It keeps everyone awake and it's a much more relaxed environment."", ""Gaming with a job and adult responsibilities is an enormous challenge, but is still worth it. There are times in my life when I have felt really bleak about it, including having my two longest running groups break apart due to acrimonious divorces. Trying to keep going with job worries, kids, ailing parents, poor health and all of the adult stuff can feel impossible or even become such a chore that you start to feel like the game is a burden rather than the stress relief it should be. Here are a few tips from my experience.\n\n* If prep is getting to you, prep less. I prep situations, not plots and find that I can go with very little prep if I'm not feeling it. Sometimes a module might be in order.\n\n* If a heavy, dramatic tone is not working try something lighter. Sometimes a little beer and pretzel murderhoboing or a silly crusade against evil are great for blowing off steam.\n\n* Try to divide the story and the action into discrete chunks that are resolved mostly session to session. Blades is good at doing this, but make certain that the game resets to a state where you can pick up the game even if some chars are missing.\n\n* Manage your expectations. I see a lot of DMs dancing on the edge of burnout on reddit because they expect each game to meet a very high standard. RPGs can be high art and grand storytelling, but every game has its ups and downs. Go easy on yourself and do not give in to the perfectionist urge.\n\n* Finally, if a game is not working for you talk to the players. You might find that they are loving it, and that all your worries are illusory. Conversely if you have real problems they may have solutions to them. Sometimes you may just have to bring a campaign to a close early and start a new one.\n\nBlades is an interesting system, but I think the setting may work better for your group than the actual game. I base this on the fact that your players are spending a lot of time planning, which Blades sees as a problem to solve rather than a potential activity that players enjoy. I have plenty of games that I love that my current groups just don't grok.\n\nThis might offend some, but I think you could lift the blades setting for a game your group is more comfortable with or even hack the rules to suit your group.\n\nAlternatively you could just set a limit on planning \nas a stopgap measure.\n\n"", ""When I read the first paragraph or two I was going to recommend Blades in the Dark to solve your woes. Then it turns out you're playing it but just having issues.\n\nYou need to read aloud to your players the player best practices from the book. My friends, some of whom are not really well versed in this kind of game, picked up jumping into the score and flashing back to prepare by the 2nd session. \n\nUse the faction downtime rules in the book, roll fortune rolls for factions and do downtime activities for them, the sandbox runs itself for you if you do these things.

When they get to a point that requires them to plan have the session end there in other words.\n\nFor the lose ends, have them come back to haunt the players. They ditched a gang? Have them come back for revenge! Pointless questions? Say that they do not know that information in character so you will not explain it to them yet. Then make up some bs thing if they continue, like rumors from a drugged up shaman or something. Doesn't have to be correct, it is just rumors after all. Too much time? Make them have a surprise encounter! Nothing like a rival gang to bust them up for taking too long to plan.\n\nThe last option is to talk to your players. If they are being to chaotic tell them about it and ask if they want to have a plot or what exactly do they want out of this game.\n\nI hope that this advice helps you out!\n\nI am making a newsletter to help provide some helpful advice to players and Dms.

rpg,t3_a54t04,"Tips for system with a mix of gamist and narrativist?First off, sorry for the reductive title; all RPGs are a mix between those two but it's the best I could come up with.

What I'm looking for is a light- to medium-weight system for relatively traditional rpg adventuring; exploration, combat, basic social interaction, and maybe some light puzzling. I'm looking for such a system that lies in between the traditional gamist, tactical approach of D&amp;D and its relatives, and the narrativist wave of PbtA and Forged in the Dark games. I also want the game to be accessible to new players. The setting in question is less important, as long as its well-suited to traditional adventuring.

The systems I've considered/am considering so far:

**Cypher System.** I like cypher system in general, but I find it has issues in that its design is very gamist but falls short when played in that way. It's very unbalanced, and that is explained by being a 'narrative-focused game', yet the design itself doesn't really support that style. On the plus side, it is *relatively* accessible, and the production value is great.

**Dungeon World.** Despite being a PbtA, this leans heavily into gamist aesthetics, and feels a bit different from a lot of other PbtAs. However, I find it kind of mixes the wrong parts for my purposes; It feels like a narrativist homage to the aesthetics of old-school gaming, while I'm after a mix of modern gamist design and modern narrative design.

**Star Wars: Force and Destiny.** The game I'm currently most heavily considering, yet the only one of them I've not so far played; only listened to played in a highly edited format (the Dice for Brains podcast) which might very well bias my view. This does seem more like what I'm after, though if I go with it I'd probably have to start with the beginner box for accessibility.

Would love your suggestions and feedback. What games might fit this that I don't yet know about?

The downside is that you need to put the work in for the fluff because it (intentionally) has basically none (though the core book has some mini-settings in it), and also decide which optional rules you use.\n\nOh, and it's indie as hell, but if you got through AW, you can probably get through this.""]"

rpg,t3_a544ce,"Handling realism vs. still having fun in a table top RPGTLDR; The game is dangerous. What's your best advice for making it realistic but not unfair and unfun. 

In a short amount of time, I'll be GMing what I hope will be my first long term campaign using a homebrew system in a homebrew setting. I'd love some advice on how to handle the players facing realistic consequences while still having fun. 

A little bit of info about the system and setting/feel, without boring you with all the details. I created the system with a couple simple goals in mind; to break out of the restrictions of the traditional class system of D&amp;D (the only other rpg I've played to date), and to make ""losing hit points"" something to be truly worried about, rather than being a minor inconvenience. As such, starting hit points are relatively low compared to the damage most weapons do, and the hit point increase per level is low as well.  Hit points are regained slowly over multiple days, and without proper care, players run the risk of infection. 

Now, about the setting and feeling. The setting is a post-alien invasion apocalyptic world, some areas inspired by Blade Runner, some areas byMad Max, and all kinds of placed that are in between. The feeling was always meant to be dark and gritty, and the world was meant to feel realistic and dangerous with conspiracy and paranoia in the ""civilized"" places, and survival and brutality in the untamed wasteland. 

I have run one shots and a campaign that was cut short when some of my players expressed that the feel of the game was not for them. I plan on starting again with the players (and some new ones) who found the change refreshing. My main focus in GMing was trying to make the decisions that the players made truly impactful, and that the players would feel as though what they were doing was important and their decisions mattered. 

In a world/game that is so dangerous, and where your decisions matter so much, it goes without saying that it is easy to die. One well placed headshot from anyone can kill an average player, who already starts with far more hit points than the average NPC. How much easier would it be to die from being assassinated in your sleep, or being surrounded by the lackeys of a mob boss you pissed off, or being sniped from a rooftop? I made it clear to the players that this is not a world of badasses, but a world of fragile survivors, however, I still want the players to have fun!

My question is what is your best advice for having a healthy dose if realistic danger, without being so unfair to your players that it isn't fun. In the games we've played before, the players seem to be good at taking precautions and being aware, but sooner or later that luck will run out, and when it does, I would love for it to be beyond memorable (in the good way!)

(By the way, this is my first post on reddit. My apologies if I've done something wrong, and sorry it's so long)

",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a544ce/handling_realism_vs_still_having_fun_in_a_table/,"['Before you try to reinvent the wheel, have a look at all the systems that already solve your problems, some of them even way before modern D&amp;D created those problems in the first place:\n\nPre-3e D&amp;D, Dungeon Crawl Classics, Shadow of the Demon Lord, various other OSR systems, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying 2e, Shadowrun, The Dark Eye, and so many more systems I could spontaneously list, if I were a bit less tired.', 'My advice - you either need to make death less punishing to the player, or refocus the game on activities that are less dangerous. Deadly combat in a combat focused game tends to result in a lot of death, unsurprisingly.\n\nSo, how can you make death less punishing to the player? Method 1 is to make death and injury less of a big deal in your setting: resurrection, bionic limbs, brain transplants, etc. Method 2 is to make replacing characters easier, both in setting and in mechanics: streamlined character creation, flatter power curves (new and old characters have similar strength), and a reliable source of new manpower. Method 3 is to make the possibility of dying without coming back in any way is part of the buy-in (the only game I know that does this is Dread, which does this by being a system exclusively for oneshots.)\n\nAs for refocusing the game on activities that are less deadly, you see this all the time. Old school D&amp;D and its retroclones have a much heavier focus on exploration and logistics, rather than fighting, especially in the lower levels. You could also do something like this with solving mysteries, investigating crimes, social intrigue, stealth, or any other non-combative dramatic activity. The important thing is that it must be engaging for the players, and combat should not be a desirable activity. Especially not fair combat. A fair fight means you lose half the time, so it can be a lot of fun setting up ambushes and such, trying to turn a ""fair"" fight into something trivial.\n\nIf you have any more specific questions, I can probably answer them. I run a lot of high realism, high consequence games. But the important thing is that you don\'t try to run them like an archetypal D&amp;D adventure.', 'I GM a lot of Dark Heresy, which is pretty close to that. Here\'s some stuff:\n\n* The heavy crunch of the system means that in one session not TOO much happens. The week-or-so break between sessions to plan realistic-but-fair/fun consequences for the previous session is a godsend. When too much happens in one session, I find myself wishing ""fuck I wish I\'d handled so-and-so differently, now that I think about it"".\n* Don\'t get attached to your antagonists, because they need to die as easily and as undramatically as your PCs.\n* Don\'t make too many ""Hard moves"", as Apocalypse World (i think) calls it. When you think your PCs have fucked up by overlooking something or missing clues, put them in a bad spot but don\'t insta-kill them or they\'ll feel like they\'re being punished for not reading your mind. So they don\'t get stabbed in their sleep, they wake up to the door creaking open and their weapons are just out of reach...\n* Meta-resources can keep tensions high and combat ""realistic"" without making death too random. In Dark Heresy you have Fate points, which can be spent for re-rolls or bonuses or burned (max permanently reduced) to survive a death as long as it\'s conceivable to do so. In theory HP is a more streamlined version of that because losing HP doesn\'t actually mean getting hit, but HP is more difficult to marry to a believable fiction that meta-points. I\'d call them Luck.\n* Don\'t be surprised when your players end up avoiding combat or really any deadly situation entirely\n\nI\'ve heard of people have memorable and fun games using ""realistic"", deadly homebrews based on D&amp;D, but I really, really recommend learning some other systems to expand your homebrewing toolkit. For example the health system from Blades in the Dark might suit your idea better than HP.\n', 'OSR games tend to be very lethal. They make it fun by having fast character creation, so that you can rejoin the game fast when you die, and a focus on the party and the adventure instead of the single PC, so that death doesn’t matter much in the larger sense. ', 'High risk, deadly games can still be fun. The problem is usually when the risk vs reward balance is not properly set.\n\n\n', ""Have you played in a game like that? If so, can you give an example of having fun in it? If not, then it runs the risk that you believe this is a good way of playing, but if you were to play in it you might find it isn't that fun for you. This happens in all game design, where someone thinks a game would be neat, builds it and plays it...and finds it's not as fun as they thought.\n\n&gt; I made it clear to the players that this is not a world of badasses, but a world of fragile survivors\n\nThere seems plenty of room to compromise - we don't have to have a game where our military guy of ten years experiences a bump on his head and dies of a brain hemorrhage. It's possible to have fights where against specific, low skill opponents the PCs feel like bad asses. While against other opponents it's very realistic and potentially fatal (though in narrative terms this is almost always a wet blanket - PCs die not because they chose to die for a cause, but because random chance)\n\nPlenty of movies have fights because it's exciting. Are you interested in compromising or do you want to make fights lethal so players can't enjoy fighting more than they enjoy your story material?\n\n"", 'Unfairness depends, I mean real fights are not fair. My opinion is, if you want fair combat, go play 5e and listen to DC and ""fair and balanced"" encounters.      \nI always do encounters that make sense, not some that are just there to be overcome by the group.      \nMy advice? If they get surrounded by hostile humans, don\'t just shoot them. Capture them instead. It all depends on how well you telegraph the intentions of the enemy they go against. Because from that everything else follows.\n\nSame with if your players ambush enemies, do you really need to play that fight out? If they are successful and it makes sense (they vs some bandits) I just skip to the end of the fight. The bandits are dead or running away. \n\nAnother important part is to give them a chance to disengage before the fight starts. I love the Dungeon World thing about ""be a fan of the characters"" because it should be true in any RPG you host. \n\nFun depends mostly on the players, you get housewives that want metal-as-fuck combat in Mythras, or you get the programmers that want to ""explore their character"" and ""dislike death and real danger to my character""...it depends on your group. These two kinds of people do not mix well in the same session. You either like thrilling fights or you do not. You can not get both player types under the same roof, there may be unicorns that love the chance to burn through a lot of well-developed characters, but usually, they don\'t. And you already made that experience. You can\'t make everyone happy, just be sure you mix it up to keep your player-pool healthy! Personally, I cycle through Traveller, Mythras, Hackmaster, and Genesys all the time. Everyone gets something they like.   \n\nRealism/sim stuff is easy, just don\'t go with a fluffy system. Having hard rules on how stuff works make things easy to understand. These guys have AK\'s? Yeah, in D&amp;D you would go ""oh, they are low level mooks anyway because the GM would not throw bad shit at us"" and in something like Mythras/GURPS and so on you would go ""Fuck, they have AK\'s"" because no, it does not matter what skill the enemy has, they can one-shot you *if* they hit. ', '""Realism"" is an oft-touted and entirely useless word in RPG design. Don\'t bother with it. \n\nIs it realistic that a single hit from a 9mm handgun will be fatal in a world without access to modern medical care? Yes, absolutely. \n\nBut it is also catastrophically un-fun if your character is on the receiving end of it.\n\nGo take a look at Apocalypse World. It\'s the game you don\'t know you want to be playing.', 'As others have said you want to look at how some other systems approach it which is that they stop fully relying on Mechanics.  Instead they begin to empower roleplaying to directly override or heavily influence the mechanics.  It is a much more difficult road to take in my opinion and requires a steady group.  Though I think DnD5e does a pretty good job at introducing this with the whole ""Did the description sound good, give an advantage!""  But it also avoids the opposite ""Did the description sound bad, give it disadvantage!""  In other words, you must provide more context to situations so that the players can provide more specificity in their actions to you.  This way the actions can be judged, and success/bonus/penalties/failures can be provided.\n\nAnother thing to accept is you as a group have to accept and work with failure.  In many newbie groups, when the party TPKs (if that\'s even possible), that\'s it...the end of the game.  But if your campaign features death as a very possible and real consequence, then the campaign must work around it.  Death needs to be made into stepping stones, not dead-ends.  For example it is somewhat foolish to run a Call of Cthulhu campaign in the same vein as a contemporary DnD adventure module which tends to focus on the heroes themselves.  In a Call of Cthulhu campaign, it\'s often the efforts and achievements of the heroes that\'s focused on, the heroes themselves are expendable.  So this can shape how the campaign and expectations of the group are structured.  The characters are not what the players care for (they do care, but it\'s not 100% of their focus), it\'s ensuring that the achievements of their characters survive and are passed on.  It is the ever evolving setting that they are influencing with each generation of characters that matters most.   That is just one example, but shows how you have to consider fail-states within your campaign.\n\nMy top systems that have much steeper consequences than most games.  Warhammer Fantasy 2e, Shadow of the Demonlord and Stars Without Number Revised (this one is available for free so you can look through it).  Oh SWN also has a (not free) campaign setting book that is a post-apocalypse setting you may be interested in.\n\nOh another aspect of those games you\'ll often see is less power gap between levels (if levels are used).  This way if a PC dies, they don\'t come back useless or need to be artificially boosted just to have a chance.  They also tend to have very fast character creation mechanics, and/or offer a lot of options.  So there are some specific mechanics that can really help out with the idea of death being just another step in a players\' journey through a campaign.']"

rpg,t3_a53v9d,"[L5R] I Need a Samurai BookHey there, r/rpg. In a week or two I'm going to be running a Legend of the Five Rings Campaign (Fantasy Flight). I'd like to get a samurai novel to read/listen to that will get the creative juices flowing. I listened to ""Across the Nightingale Floor"" but it was far more ninja than samurai.  


So I ask the community for a book or any other source that is going to put into the correct headspace for running this kind of game.

&amp;#x200B;

If it helps, I will be running a party from one clan. I would like to touch on all the high points the core rulebook hits; intrigue, duels, battles, supernatural, and bushido.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a53v9d/l5r_i_need_a_samurai_book/,"['Shogun. L5R is fakey-Japanese and that particular story works well. ', ""Do you want Japanese historical drama, or L5R? They're not the same thing.\n\nIf the former, look up the worlds of Eiji Yoshikawa. Some of it has been translated into English.\n\nFor the latter, try [this](https://kazenoshiro63445525.wordpress.com/)."", ""The aforemention Shogun as the TV show is also worth checking out. I watched it in preparation for my Oriental campaign. Also, check out Akira Kurosawa's samurai films."", 'Oh boy, here I go [recommending books] again!\n\nFull disclosure: I really tried to get into the Nightingale books, but just didn\'t enjoy them.\n\nEiji Yoshikawa has already been mentioned, but not his specific works in translation.  His novel Musashi is a heavily embellished retelling of the life of Miyamoto Musashi, starting with his surviving the Battle of Sekigahara despite being on the losing side.  He learns philosophy from Takuan Soho (which probably didn\'t happen), impresses Yagyu Munenori with his flower arranging, and eventually (minor spoiler) fights Sasaki Kojiro on Ganryu island and founds his Two Heavens Style school.  It\'s a doorstopper of a book, but a surprisingly quick read. Got adapted into the Samurai Trilogy of films starring Toshiro Mifune.  It goes without saying they\'re great movies.  Yoshikawa has another novel, Taiko, that\'s about the rise and fall of Hideyomi Toyotoshi.  I haven\'t finished it, as it doesn\'t read quite as briskly as Musashi does, but still good.  Also a doorstopper.\n\nYasushi Inoue has a novel, The Samurai Banner of Furin Kazan, which focuses on the final years of Takeda Shingen, another major personality like Hideyoshi during the end of the Sengoku Period and leading into the Tokugawa Shogunate.  It\'s slimmer than Yoshikawa\'s novels, and more tightly paced.\n\nFor stuff written in English and thus no worries about translation quality (though the above are all generally held to be good examples of the craft), there\'s two other authors that I\'ve really enjoyed and heartily recommend.  First is Laura Joh Rowland\'s Sano Ichiroh novels.  There\'s nearly 20, but you can just start with Shinju and see if it\'s your jam.  In short the protagonist is an investigator who has to feel his way between the obligations of late Edo era society and a growing understanding of forensics that is sharply at odds with the usual method of the day of "" clap in irons then beat a confession out of the lowest status suspect"".\n\nA somewhat better fit might be the Yamada Monogatari novels by Richard Parks.  Although they take place in late Heian Era Japan rather than the more popular Sengoku or Edo Eras, they take place in a Japan whose mythological creatures are fully present and active. Kami don\'t just exist as a metaphysical idea, but are occasionally called upon to bear witness.  Yamada no Goji is also an investigator, but of a rather eccentric sort: his noble status allows him much greater latitude in pursuing leads, and his drunken Buddhist priest friend Kenji assists with any exorcisms or spiritual matters that come up along the way.  Just one example, early on he offers rice to a lantern ghost to find out if a certain person had crossed a certain bridge that the lantern haunted.  They\'re fun novels and, more importantly, the easiest to find at a local bookstore.', ""Is there some reason you don't just read some Legend of the Five rings novels?

rpg,t3_a53kgi,"Technoir Returns!The high-tech, hard-boiled roleplaying of Technoir has been acquired by Dream Machine Productions, the design studio owned and operated by Justin Alexander, and will be receiving active support — including new supplements, new transmissions, and new expansions — starting in January 2019.

Technoir, an exciting cyber-noir roleplaying game featuring a radical new mechanical approach and a revolutionary plot-mapping approach to improvised scenario design, was originally launched via a trend-setting and highly successful Kickstarter campaign in 2011. Designed by Jeremy Keller, the core rulebook was released in Fall 2011, with Mechnoir — an expansion player’s guide which took the game to Mars and introduced mechanics for running mecha-based scenarios — following in the spring of 2012. The game won a Judges’ Spotlight Ennie in 2012.

At that point, unfortunately, development stalled with several of the Kickstarter stretch goals still unfulfilled, and Technoir has lain fallow for the past six years. Having secured rights to the game, however, DMP has been quietly getting the core rulebook back into distribution channels via Indie Press Revolution, revamped the Technoir website, and begun development on a suite of new supplements for the game.

The first and most important goal for Justin Alexander and DMP has been to, at long last, fulfill the missing stretch goals which the original 600+ Kickstarter backers have been waiting for. We know that many of them have given up hope of ever seeing these stretch goals delivered, but we recognize that without them the game would not exist and we want to do right by them. Original backers of Technoir should return to the Kickstarter campaign page, where they will find an update explaining the steps they need to follow in order to claim their stretch goals.

All of this work culminates on January 1st, with a major relaunch of Technoir featuring:

**Morenoir**. The original 12-page PDF stretch goal has been super-sized into a 38-page supplement featuring run-time operations, advanced options for the game, a transmission creation guide, and Jeremy’s Guide to Writing Player’s Guides for Technoir.

**Indianapolis Conplex**. A brand new transmission for Technoir, featuring the 6x6 Master Table of connections, events, factions, locations, objects, and threats that lie at the heart of every Technoir scenario.

**Kepler Station**. A twist on the typical Technoir transmission, set in the space station atop the Kilimanjaro orbital elevator. Kepler Station is more than just a highway to the solar system. It’s a city in space, with a population of 20,000 lurking within its spheres of plascrete, rock, and steel.

In addition to immediately receiving their long-awaited copies of Morenoir on January 1st, the original Kickstarter backers will also receive access to playtest copies of Hexnoir, the Technoir magic supplement. These playtest materials will include the full text of the Hexnoir supplement plus three bonus transmissions, with final PDF versions to be released within a few months after the radical new mechanics have endured a proper trial by fire.

Although this will, at long last, bring the Technoir Kickstarter to conclusion, it’s just the beginning for Technoir. Dream Machine Productions and Justin Alexander are proud to have received this baton, and they have plans to carry the torch into the neon-drenched future.

So, I will present my logs of the three sessions of this arc so far.\n\n**Session 1:**\n\nThe players are investigating vicious rumors that are slandering the candidates of the second ever election for the First Minister. The candidates are the incumbent, [Ricard Tumblar](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/characters/21529), and rival politician\xa0[Delia Snowbound](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/characters/21534).\xa0Ricard Tumbler was the head of ""The Union"" which he founded twenty years ago, and many rumors are about his shady dealings with them, or other very imaginative accusations regarding his personal life, especially with women. Delia Snowbound is a surviving member of the former nobility, who has given up all ties to her bloodline. Rumors about her involve that she never really gave up past ties, secret lovers, secret political alliances, and her real motives for running for first minister.\n\nThe players investigated the various printers across the city to see who was printing these pamphlets. There are six presses owned by five companies, all west of the city wall/river. They explored and found: \n\n[**Courier Press**](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/organisations/3340): They are an upscale printer on the docks by the Adsea. They didn\'t really have any information other than being approached by an unnamed Starlish gentleman, but they had the first Brett. \n\n[**Hendrix Printers:**](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/organisations/3339)\xa0Their Brett was super duper excited when you came to him with rumors of politicians being naughty. Perhaps they were the ones printing all the rumors. But after some intense questioning,\xa0[you found that they print stuff like this](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1464277248l/28404666.jpg). \n\n[**Your Friendly Librarian**](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/organisations/3337):\xa0 This is a two woman operation, and she didn\'t have much. Nor did she have a Brett. \n\n***Lunch break***: You all stopped by a local bakery for some pastries and coffee. You heard lots of talk about the rumors swirling around. You also heard lots of people dissatisfied with the Union trying to focus on other countries, or not focusing enough on the lowest jobs locally like the street sweeps or laundresses. But for some reason some brothels were unionizing? People were also talking about the vote for the second minster (vice minister), between the pro union [Trifanon](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/characters/22893) and the pro-business candidate\xa0[Scadros.](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/characters/22896) \n\n[**Adopest Chronicle**](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/organisations/3277): This is the city newspaper. You stole a glance at some of the articles that are being worked on. You found some articles. One is about the price of textiles going up, another about how Beon J. Ipaly is doing in the civil war (he restored peace in the south recently), and another about their investigation into these rumors. Their Brett didn\'t have much, but his colleague did have a lead about the former General Kett, the war profiteer, living out her life rather comfortably in Bakasha. \n\n[**Silver Printing**](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/organisations/3338): This printer is a vanity printer. Their Brett was rather nervous at first, but eventually you got the truth for him. He was able to describe the same Starlish individual who was having them distribute their pamphlets with their couriers. They stopped for now, but they fear vague threats. His propaganda papers come from upriver, and that is all they know as they don\'t really do investigative journalism. \n\n**Session 2:**\n\nThe group led by Isaac and the bribes of Dave, discovered that Silver Printing no longer does the rumor distribution. The shady Starlish gentleman has arranged for the local street urchins (who don\'t understand bribes very well) to do the distribution. They work under the care of a woman named [Vesna](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/characters/22707), getting drop offs at the river\'s edge where the two rivers to the north of the city meet, before it flows into the Adsea. Isaac found a contact, a local merchant by the name of [Miladena](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/characters/22708). She has heard rumors of Vesna attempting to buy local commodities.\n\nThat evening. due to a miscommunication, Isaac went to investigate [Silver Printing](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/organisations/3338). Many strange rolls later, Isaac, Dave, and Yossi were all in the building, looking for clues high and low. Isaac found some orders in a corner office. All managed to get out without alerting the four guards. Three of which were at the doors to the docks. During this time, Ian got bored of keeping watch by himself (he was abandoned by Dave and Yossi) and literally killed a man at an underground boxing match.\n\nThe next day at lunch, the gang met with [Vukoslav](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/characters/22709), a respectable importer at the docks. Vesna approached him, a legitimate business woman representing Starlish Shipping International (a private company) looking to get him exporting. Largely importing, Vukoslav said he was very happy to get into the export business. He sells Vesna large quantities of wool, but also substantial amounts of cotton and wheat. The party asked him about the rumors of the rising prices of textiles, to which Vukoslav said that is the ebb and flow, especially with the protracted civil war in [Kez](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/locations/22717).\n\nWhen asked who Vukoslav would vote for, he said that both [Delia Snowbound](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/characters/21534) and [Ricard Tumblar](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/4806/characters/21529)\xa0are in favor of international trade, but for very different reasons. Delia wants to improve international relations, monarchs don\'t like coups, especially ones that lead to democracies. Ricard wants to expand his union, at which point Vukoslav grumbled something about the union demanding a 15 krana an hour minimum wage.\n\nAfter the meeting, the party gets a good rest to head out for a very early morning. The urchins said the next distribution shipment is 4am, and everybody went to the river to fish nice and early to stake it out. Ian managed to fish with some gunpowder charges and got you all a nice buy messy breakfast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;', ""Right at the moment I'm in the middle of about six major NPCs for my homebrew 5e game.

rpg,t3_a4z3c7,"Ran DND for the first time and found all prejudices trueEdit 2: I was advised that the correct word I should have used would be stereotypes not prejudices. Sorry, English is a second language.

I had a fascinating experience recently where I DM'd 5e for a group of colleagues, none of us with experience in the system, but some general experience in TTRPGs. We played around 4 hours through a short 2-room dungeon, with a fairly classic setup (save the blacksmith's daughter from goblin sacrifice). I had a bunch of sample characters laid out, from which the players picked. The exploration and combat encounters were fun, fluid, and sufficiently challenging (they barely escaped death). 

But all of the prejudices and complaints I had heard of about DND were so clearly showcased it was almost fascinating. First we had a no call no show. Then I had to discuss rules (which spells need a spell attack roll), our rogue stole loot gold and almost brought about PvP when the other players challenged him on it. I have no idea how I will resolve this next session btw. And to cap it off, the time we spent packing up was filled with debate on alignment despite me repeatedly saying to not worry to much about that and focus on looking at their characters motivations, instincts and flaws. 

I could hardly believe it that the memes I've heard about DND just stared me blank in the face like that. I'm utterly curious how the next sessions will go. I will probably put something less dungeon-crawly before them, and I'll see how it goes.

Edit: Y'all dropped about 10 times as many comments as I expected and I have a hard time keeping up on my phone. Let me address some common comments:

1. I don't think that my problems are DND- problems. I just wanted to express my surprise at running into exactly the things that people on the internet complained about with their DND games. 

2. We actually had a pretty good time and in terms of first games I've had far worse. I think 5e is a fun game and I enjoy its combat far more than some of the other games I've played. 

3. Of course no call no show is not a DND problem. It's just one of the almost memetic issues I've read about in connection with DND. This is obviously not a system problem...

4. Still excited to play next year. 

5. Thank you for all your advice and comments, I'll try to get to you later in the day.

That shouldn't be too surprising. Some of the things like the thief / rogue being a dick to the rest of the party, have been problems since the 1970s. Fortunately there are solutions to these issues.\n\nFor the rogue stealing gold, either let the players have their drama (hopefully the rogue gets stabbed), or just rule that the gold is split between the party. Problem solved.\n\nFor alignment, if it isn't adding to the game, just rule that you're playing without alignment. Some retro clones get rid of alignment altogether, because it basically adds nothing to the game."", ""Most of those things don't really seem like they're the related to the system (except the alignment question) and have more to do with the people involved?"", ""I think everyone's missing the point. Of course it's not a system specific issue. It's just since D&amp;D happens to be the biggest, most well-known tabletop rpg around. That's why it's what all that stuff has been associated with. It literally is where all those tropes started because it was the first and most popular."", '\\&gt;our rogue stole loot gold and almost brought about PvP when the other  players challenged him on it. \n\n\\&gt;I have no idea how I will resolve this  next session btw.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy would you need to resolve it? Are the players taking it well, or are they letting the in game and out of game emotions blend together?\n\n&amp;#x200B;', 'Sounds more like a group of new players trying to figure out what they can get away with in a new game. A lot of that will settle down with experience.', 'I sometimes make simple rules for loot to avoid that kind of crap re: the rogue. Just auto split any gold loot across the group. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I house rule and say no alignment allowed. More fun that way. ', '&gt; focus on looking at their characters motivations, instincts and flaws\n\nIf this is what you and your players are interested in, D&amp;D is probably not going to do much for you. You can twist its arm, and plenty of people do, but you often end up with situations exactly like the situation you ended up with.\n\nD&amp;D works best when you\'re dungeon crawling or doing something functionally similar (or, as with every RPG, when you\'re basically just playing freeform and everyone\'s on the same page - but that takes time and shared interest to develop, and it doesn\'t sound like your group\'s going in that direction). D&amp;D doesn\'t do pre-defined character motivations, instincts, and flaws very well.\n\nAnd it doesn\'t need them! Handwave most of it away, crawl some dungeons, have fun, find treasure, save the blacksmith\'s daughter from goblin sacrifice, and don\'t worry so much about why. If what you want is to dig into characters\' motivations, instincts, and flaws, other games will make that *way* easier to do, structuring the game more to avoid situations like those you describe.\n\nWhen you push people to worry about why, to play D&amp;D as a character drama, you get the thief acting ""in-character"" stealing the treasure. Since D&amp;D has very little to say about motivations, instincts, and flaws, since the typical challenges of the game aren\'t directed at those things, the main place they tend to come up is when a player is trying to justify being uncooperative while the rest of the table groans (often called the ""but it\'s what my guy would do"" problem).\n\nThe key to D&amp;D in my experience is to not worry so much about characters. And in the same way, you\'ll worry less about rules. People will naturally involve their characters in ways when it makes sense, but no one typically finds it fun when someone tries to roleplay their D&amp;D stats or when the game grinds to a halt because a player decides to steal from the other characters because their character is a greedy thief. Don\'t try to roleplay your low int score by pretending not to know the answer to puzzles or roleplay your alignment by making the other players frustrated. As a GM, tell players not to worry about their character sheets aside from combat.

I don\'t know how he thought the party would react to him rushing past everyone, setting off a trap that damaged the whole group, and then stealing all the loot from the trapped chest he just opened would go over but it started an argument.  \nAfterwords I spoke out of character about party cohesion and he eventually understood that while roleplaying your character is generally a good thing, to do so at the detriment of the party and other players is just a dick move both in and out of character.

rpg,t3_a4y433,"Help for Xas Irkalla and A DM who freestyles. game breaking and PKing
EDIT 1: Warning to readers. PLEASE READ THIS FIRST.
I was irrational and sort of resentful when I wrote this childish revenge rant. I don’t think there is much reason to read what I wrote below but I am keeping it up for posterity. After I calmed down and read some comments I have this solution: I’m just gonna tell the GM that we should have a set of rules in game that don’t change in the middle of the session and that I want him to do a little planning before we play. I genuinely would like to hear about how Players found success and made powerful characters in a game like Xas Irkalla . Thanks everyone who commented before I wrote this update. I’m so sorry you had to read that haha . My bad. Thanks.



TLDR I was screwed over in Xas Irkalla in a 3 man group by the other player and DM. Can you give me any advice on creating a possibly game breaking character to dominate the other player?

Hey I like to play this RPG Xas Irkalla with some of my friends . Originally we were a group of 4 but one left . Now it’s 2 players and one DM. I mention this because the player who left was the voice of reason. Now I, a player, and the other player don’t really get along. He constantly wants to murder people and will do things like push my character down stairs or generally screw me over.

This came to ahead in the last game . The DM refuses to plan dungeons and instead just freestyles encounters . Which is cool but it means basically no well thought out puzzles or interesting stories . Instead we just interact with npc’s he comes up with on the spot. We basically just murder people . Well we ended up in a colosseum fighting a levithan . Somehow we killed it in 3 rounds . In the last round it swallowed me whole, but the DM allowed me to get an attack if I could role a crit . I did and killed the thing. After it was defeated the DM said : “hey I haven’t been making you guys do death rolls so now Ralph, my character’s name, you have to do a death roll after you climb out of its stomach”. My character died . And the other player took all my stuff and said he was glad I was dead . 

Now I’m fine with dying . It’s a part of RPG’s . But the fact that the DM was just making stuff up , not closely following the rules , or even his own made up rules consistently bothers me . I feel like he killed me to tell us to be more serious. Also up to that point I thought we were playing with kid gloves on. For example the other player has enhanced taste and will just lick things . He has licked all kinds of poisons and weird things with no real consequence except something vague like “you hear a screaming in your head add 1 stress”. I just think if the DM is just making stuff up on the spot we shouldn’t have to fight insane monsters who kill us with one attack and pop up out of nowhere. The consequences seem to high. 

I own a copy of the rules but haven’t read past page 30ish out of respect for the DM. However today I plan on spending my time at a coffee shop reading the rules and trying to create a plan to make an unstoppable player killing character to .sorry this sounds so crazy and evil. 

So if you know anything about this game or rpg PKing in general I would greatly appreciate your advice . Also any stories on how to get a DM to actually plan adventures weather in game or out of game would be nice .

If your group is making you miserable, either talk to them out of character (ie as real human people) and try to resolve the problem so everybody\'s happy, or find a better group.

But if you are creative, it seems like your GM is pretty lax so you could create a badass weird character which might have more narrative abilities and power. \n\nYou should note Xas Irkalla technically requires a death roll everytime you take damage, so combat is freaking brutal.

As Derp_Stevenson said, the system itself didn\'t do very much of the work, but it did give us a good starting point (we had premade characters but still used the questions to establish our relationships), and otherwise gave us a good, simple framework for playing out the kind of mystery it\'s made for. From what I\'ve seen of the character sheet (and skimming through the pdf after I got it in the Halloween DTRPG sale), creating characters is dead simple anyway, just pick a character trope (""jock"", ""weirdo"", ""overprotective parent"", etc) and choose from the suggested strengths and flaws, and go. Or just assign a die size to each of the 6 stats and choose the strengths and flaws from the master list. Either way it\'s fast and gives you a simple, evocative character to play with.\n\nIn my case, I picked up the Jock playbook, and within a few minutes established that I was an overconfident lunkhead, but fiercely protective of my nerdy younger brother and had an awkward crush on the cheerleader (whose brother was my brother\'s best friend).\n\nPlaying the game was also simple, just roll the die for your trait (sometimes with bonuses) against a difficulty, and for each failure you get an Adversity Token that you can use to bump up a later roll, for yourself or someone else.\n\nI think it\'s a good game for when you want a basic one-shot that\'s evocative of 80\'s kid horror movies, but not something as complicated as Tales from the Loop. From skimming through the full book, it also has some good advice about setting boundaries for a horror game (especially good with a setting like this where some people might want to play ""It"" with lots of death and abusive parents, while others are expecting something more goofy and light like ""Hocus Pocus"") and discussing how to handle issues like race and disability before play, and advice for the GM on building the story around the town the players have built, and adjusting the pacing and tone to how the players are playing. In other words, more general GM advice than hard setting or lore notes.

Beware, the once lost weapons have a tendency to eventually return to the pages.*\n\n**When you browse the Glossary of Blades for a weapon** answer the following questions:\n\n * What is the legend of this weapon, what great task was it used to accomplish?\n\n * How does this weapon’s power threaten those it is used against? How does it threaten those who wield it?\n\n * What must someone do to prove they are worthy to wield this weapon?\n\n**As you withdraw the weapon from the Glossary and claim it as your own** Roll+INT,\n\n * On a 10+, the weapon is exactly as described in legends.\n\n * On a 7-9, the Glossary neglected some details, the GM will tell you the true answer to one of the questions above.\n\n * On a 6-, the GM will tell you of some dark secret hidden within this weapon.

rpg,t3_a4wu3h,"The Deep Carbon Observatory: 5e Conversion?(Crosspost)

Hi, all! I was flipping through an adventuring module for another system (Lamentations of the Flame Princess) named Deep Carbon Observatory, and due to the evocative prose and wonderfully scratchy illustrations, I've made it my goal to attempt to run it in 5e, considering that it's the system I'm most accustomed to utilizing.

That being said, I was wondering if anyone here knew how best I could go about converting monsters and such into the parameters of 5e. To my understanding, LotFP is a very high-lethality system, and although I do wish to retain some of that gritty, dung-age aesthetic present in the flavor text of the module, starting at level 1 seems a little dull to me- so maybe scaling towards a party of level 8 players would be ideal, imo. Are there any general tips for conversion? Or, even better, has anyone attempted trying to convert LotFP modules to 5e before? And if so, to what degree of success? (In particular I want to convert the Crows and the Giant inside the titular Observatory but I've no idea where to begin with that.)

",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a4wu3h/the_deep_carbon_observatory_5e_conversion/,"[""Don't have any specific advice, but I would suggest to take this opportunity to tailor the adventure to your party rather than to some generic 8th level group. You know what they can handle. \n\nAlso, I suggest having a read of LotFP to give you an idea of where it is coming from. Don't worry, Lamentations is far from a long book. D&amp;D 5e characters are entirely different beasts from what you find in OSR, with more options and ways to be effective. This will compound as level rises."", 'Having read DCO, run Death Frost Doom, and played against a few creatures from Veins of the Earth, I would caution against eighth level for 5e adventurers. The power creep is real and it will feel far less like the desperate crawl to the Observatory with them starting that high of a level. \n\nI’d personally go with maybe third level so that they have their specialties and if you’re feeling generous, a handy magic item or two (just none with outright stat boosts). This should also help with expectations of them winning a fight outright. If you wanna beat the Crows, you gotta fight dirty. If you wanna survive, you gotta play smart. \n\nBut as always, feel free to do your own thing too! It’s not like making things more “fair” ruins the module; it just changes the feel. Regardless of what you go with, please report back! I’d love to hear how it turned out. ', ""It's all just DnD. There's not much to do but hack the stats to fit the 5e brand. Does it look that daunting?"", ""Dndwithpornstars, Zak S' blog, has a OSRified 5e conversion list. Perhaps check that out and adapt it to your own group's playstyle.""]"

rpg,t3_a4u7ii,"GM tip No1 : Challenge based XPSo first thing you need to do is to open your Dungeon master guide ( or whatever it is called in your system ) find page or pages that explains how to award XP and rip it off. Cause you never going to need it again.  


Kidding. Dont hurt your precious books :) And we are going to need it for the first step, anyway.  


Lets take a nice popular system. Let say 5e D&amp;D  


First thing you are going to see that encounters are ranked : Easy, Medium, Hard, and Deadly.   


Now using some power of mathematics magic. ( And please if anyone wishes to adjust me - do so now and i will repair my statement. ) We can see that D&amp;D 5e awards roughly 20% XP needed for level up for Deadly encounters.  


So it will mean that : Easy encounter awards 5% , Medium 10%, Hard 15% and Deadly 20%  


Now you can rip out those pages ! ( Kidding again )  


From now note that every obstacle players face in game is challenge. Solving mystery is challenge, avoiding trap is challenge, encounter is challenge. Just rank those challenges as you please with this 4 rankings ( or add some more ).  


If you can not decide how challenging the encounter is ( and again anything can be encounter ) just see how much players struggle with it. If they have real hard time solving something - give them 15% XP. Someone died ? Give them 20%. They worked real hard but didn't succeed , dont be stingy - give them half of what you think they would get by solving it... or dont. Its up to you.  


So there you go. Real easy game mechanic demystified system.  


Never look at that chart again ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a4u7ii/gm_tip_no1_challenge_based_xp/,"[""Congratulations, you've invented 4e's XP system."", ""Nah. Used goal-based XP.

rpg,t3_a4ta10,"So I'm trying to reinvent GURPS but simplified somewhat like d&amp;d 5eMy friends and I started out in dnd 5e and it is a lot of fun. It is easy to understand and streamlined. One glaring issue. I don't do conventional settings thus classes feel wrong and so do a lot of other minor things.

So here I am trying to write up a set of rules that
1. Uses the fallout series S.P.E.C.I.A.L system because it makes a lot of sense.
2. Doesn't use classes but rather feats. Like how a fighter can be broken down into a series of feats and proffs.
3. How do I make sci-fi rules fit together with magic rules. I understand they may never exist at the same time but still though.
4. Still has to flow well. My friends don't have super strong attention spans and if whatever I make doesn't flow well then it will be lost on them. (I've looked at other rpg series and boy they make dnd 5e look like a kiddie pool of rules)

I already have step 1 done but step 2 is a pain and I thought I could get a few pointers in the right direction to remaking GURPS simple edition.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a4ta10/so_im_trying_to_reinvent_gurps_but_simplified/,"['It sounds like you\'ve never played GURPS so my only piece of advice for now is this, ""Play GURPS!"" You cannot reinvent something you don\'t understand.

You can have a wizard and a jedi, or a knight and a psionic in the same team! And whatever genre you want, in 300 pages or less (half is for the players, the other for the GM). So you can play with a cyborg-zombie-ninja-pirate without reinventing the wheel.\n\nIt can be taught in a session, and mastered in 3-4 (your players don't even have to read the corebook if you simply do a one-shot).\n\nIt has a quickly resolution: almost all tasks are resolved with rolling one or two dice and confronting them with the Target Number, which usually is 4. Fast!\n\nNo hit point but wounds: you only have to track 3 serious hit for the player characters, and only one for the mooks. Furious!\n\nNo roll for initiative: each eound the GM deals a card to every player, and proceed with a countdown, and each player reveals his card when called. Who is going to go first? Who has to wait for the zombies to attack? Who ould interrupt the action with a Joker? This keeps the tension high, and thus the attention span. Fun!\n\nSkilled GM and players (veterans of 3+ sessions) can resolve a round in 5 minutes, and then other cards are dealt! Fast, furious, fun!\n\nYou only need the core book (the Deluxe edition, 10$ for the pdf), but SW is plenty of supplements and settings with more edges, gears, npcs, and so on...\n\nhttps://www.peginc.com/store/savage-worlds-deluxe-explorers-edition/\n"", 'I recommend not starting with DND 5e as a base.\n\nSolution one is to find RPGs that fit the settings you want to run. I can almost guarantee that there is an RPG right for your setting, and I’m sure you can find easier, if slightly less generic, games with similiar goals to GURPS that your setting could fit within.\n\n', ""You're coming at this from the wrong end. You're trying to take a system (that it sounds like you've never played, and thus don't grok) that is legendarily crunchy, and re-engineer it into something it was never intended to be, because you *think* it's what your players want.\n\nIt also sounds like you don't really know what your players want because you haven't asked them, and also that you don't really trust them in the first place (why are you playing with them?).\n\nThe first thing you need to do is sit your group down and talk with them. Do, for lack of a better term, a session pre-zero. Find out what they want, what they're interested in. What kind of games they'd like to play, what would get them engaged. What inspires them.\n\nThen, once you have that information, you can make an informed decision about what systems to look into."", '""Simplified GURPS"" is kinda contrary to the point of GURPS. It\'s also a system that runs fairly smoothly, but it can be pretty complex in the character creation department just from the sheer number of options, and also the system is *extremely* fatal when it comes to damage. If your players are used to D&amp;D style hit points- and if you describe them as murder hobos, I kinda assume they are- then it could lead to a pretty heavy death count on the PC side.', ""Two things:\n\nFirst, it seems (these things are hard to tell across the internet) that you're underestimating your friends. Talk to your players! That's the most important rule of roleplaying! Ask them what they'd like to play. Tell them what you're not happy with about your current game, and what you'd like to do. Find out what they're excited about. If they're interested in learning a game, they'll easily be able to.\n\nSecond, if you want to design a game then go for it! But it seems like you don't have all that much experience with different games, and I'd strongly recommend studying other games to improve your craft. Play as many different games as you can, especially if you want to base your design on one. If you can't play them, at least read a lot of games. Read different games - are you familiar with super-simple one page games? Things like [Lasers &amp; Feelings](http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/) or [Grant Howitt's games](https://gshowitt.itch.io/) are revelations of simplicity. Take a look at [Fate](https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/), especially Accelerated, for a complete generic game which is still much simpler than D&amp;D and GURPS. All of these are free, so why not? They might not be the game you want to play, but they will teach you a lot about your options.\n\nDo some little exercises as well - write down a dice mechanic, and play some scenes against yourself to see how it feels, that sort of thing. (Writers don't jump straight into a novel, they write short stories, and before that little snippets - descriptions, dialogues, plot outlines - that are just for practice, and for fun. We should do the same.)"", 'I LOVE GURPS, but I\'d second the recommendation that you look to Savage Worlds or something else.\n\n1. GURPS does not use the Fallout Special system. Yes, Fallout was supposed to used GURPS. Maybe they based SPECIAL a *little* on GURPS, but the systems are actually really different. \n2. GURPS is classless (so is Savage Worlds) but isn\'t really feat-based. Yes, advantages can be a big part of where your character\'s points go, but I don\'t think they\'re quite the same.\n3. GURPS does this. Savage Worlds does this, too.\n4. I have a group that is like this - they don\'t want to read a page of background info let alone an entire rule set. For GURPS, you probably want a program, spreadsheet, or at least a calculator to make a character. Yeah, you can do this with various packages/modifications/etc. to make it easier, and yes it\'s fairly basic arithmetic, but it\'s a beast relative to most other systems. That\'s the cost of having one of the most flexible and open-ended character generation systems around (which is an awesome upside). \n\nIf you\'re dead-set on GURPS, use GURPS-Lite as the base and pull out/add stuff as you see fit. Honestly, that\'s how most actual GURPS games work - start with the basic rules and then tinker until it has as much crunch and flexibility as you want. You could pare it all the way down to ""these are your four stats, here\'s a set of ability value arrays to choose from, when you want to do something roll 3d6 equal to or under your value."" On top of that, you can add a narrow list of advantages/disadvantages and let them pick up to two of each, a subset of relevant skills (e.g. you can drop cooperage or accounting from the skill list if they won\'t be relevant for your game) letting them pick X number of skills, and a short list of weapons and armor. That\'s just an example of a super-quick sreamlining, but there are as may ways of doing it as there are actual games of GURPS - it\'s really designed to be that sort of tool kit.', ""If you want something streamlined but free form, I'd recommend *Mutants and Masterminds* - it's dressed as a superhero game but you can use it for anything and it feels much more consistent (to me) than *Savage Worlds.*""]"
rpg,t3_a4svz0,"5e Spreadsheet for Dice Rolling, Random Races, and even Captain Kirk's Love ChildrenTLDR: I'm a spreadsheet nerd and I made a thing for rolling stats and choosing a random race or hybrid race ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hVNGrYkKWCUQOJVi4jUQBjL1MysFI5geGEDyAWzroj4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hVNGrYkKWCUQOJVi4jUQBjL1MysFI5geGEDyAWzroj4/edit?usp=sharing))

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So I saw an old post on GiantITP ([http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?483241-5e-Half-Breed-System&amp;p=23560286#post23560286](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?483241-5e-Half-Breed-System&amp;p=23560286#post23560286)) and it really peaked my interest. With my players' tendency to go all Captain Kirk on the locals, I figured it would be handy to have something like this around. I took Erniemist's work and slapped it onto a Google sheet. Once I finished coping everything over, I wanted to make random half-breeds or hybrid races. 

&amp;#x200B;

It took me a bit to get the formulas to work the way I wanted. Certain functions recalculate whenever there is an edit on the page. RandBetween is one of those functions and is the go to for spreadsheet nerds wanting a computer to roll dice. So if you edit one cell, suddenly all your random numbers in that sheet are recalculated. To get around that, I had to scavenge someone else's script to generate a random integer :([https://www.w3schools.com/js/js\_random.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp))

function getRndInteger(min, max) {

  return Math.floor(Math.random() \* (max - min + 1) ) + min;

}

Once I had that added in \[=getRndInteger(1, CountUnique(RacesB2:B))\] and had my conditional formulas in properly, I was finally able to make random racial combinations. I will tell you, for some unholy reason, I had several results with halfling/ogre crosses. He was a brave soul. /shudder

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I couldn't leave it there. I wanted to be able to roll up stats for PCs/NPCs quickly and I already had the racial features there. So I added a section to click a box to roll stats which can then be assigned to specific abilities. I made it so the rolling method could be customized. I like to go with 4d6, drop the lowest, and reroll 1s on 1st character of campaign. In order to allow customization, I set the formula to check the number of dice to be rolled (I only went to 10,  in case someone wanted to play at making a god), the dice size (6 for a d6, 8 for a d8), and then whether to drop the lowest, reroll1s, or reroll 2s.



= getRndInteger(ifs($F$24=true,3,$E$24=true,2,$E$24=false,1), $C$24) 

&amp;#x200B;

= getRndInteger(   - the regular formula is =getRndInteger(min, max) i.e. for a six sided: =getRndInteger(1, 6)

Ifs($F$24=true,3   - if you reroll 2s, your min value is 3

,$E$24=true,2       -  if you reroll 1s instead, your min value is 2

,$E$24=false,1(       - if neither of these are true, your min value is 1     

, $C$24)                     - this being the cell where we entered the size of our dice, our max value

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty proud of it and I'll probably continue to add to it, starting with a sheet with full racial descriptions. Then maybe sheets for classes and spells and have them all feed into a main character sheet. Until then, I wanted to go ahead and share it with you all and see what you thought. I've spent about a day working on it altogether so far. Thank you for reading this far. Good night.

rpg,t3_a4riyg,"One epic campaign, multiple role playing systems concept. (Follow up)3 months ago I posted a crazy campaign idea my friends and I had where you play one continuous ongoing story but “jump” throughout multiple role playing games. For example from dungeons and dragons to shadowrun or G.U.R.P.S or Starfinder.

After some trial and error we decided to give it a try but also make it a podcast. We just launched our first “jump” episode where we go from 1st edition dungeons and dragons to the wild west world of Boothill. Using a Quantum leap stye concept, we take over bodies of people already living in the wild west world but still have all our original character minds. Some events occur to allow the host bodie’s memories to enter our brain allowing us to know how certain skills or weapons work in this new world based on their knowledge. We decided to play different systems instead of just one system because we wanted to give these games (some of which are very old school) some airtime and treat the listeners to something they may not have known about while also creating a very cool and interesting RPG concept and podcast.

If anyone is interested you can listen in from the links below. Also we would greatly appreciate any feedback or ideas for future “jumps” and fun, but genre different, RPG systems we could go to in the future.

Thanks for everyone’s advice and help in advance.

rpg,t3_a4r2xq,Is OVA a better game than BESM was?I have neither and am interested in something along these lines as maybe a generic/universal system.,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a4r2xq/is_ova_a_better_game_than_besm_was/,"['Yes. BESM was pretty cumbersome while the newer version of OVA is pretty easy to use.', 'I’ll start by saying I haven’t run OVA yet. But I did run a lot if besm in college and from what I can tell ova is way better. The neat thing about besm and besm d20 was the amount of source books for certain anime settings but the mechanics are terrible and almost unusable in game. Would highly recommend ova. Just from reading it, it’s a fine tuned version of the things I liked from the old west end games like Star Wars in terms of design philosophy. But unique in its own right. Simple, fast action and role play, complexity based on customization to desired effect, essentially as complex or simple as you want. My non chaosium or d&amp;d games will for sure use ova as a universal system.', 'ITT: Acronyms I don\'t know.\n\nAnd, to maybe help others:\n\nOVA: [""Open Versatile Anime RPG""](https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12379.phtml)\n\nBESM: [Big Eyes, Small Mouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Eyes,_Small_Mouth) (another anime RPG system)', ""I wouldn’t say OVA is strictly better. BESM may have gotten heavier and heavier per edition, but I will say that BESM 3rd may be the best edition of that game. Ultimately it comes down to what you are looking for but the advantage BESM has over OVA is details. I felt like there were better ways to finer tune a character in BESM 3rd than in OVA.\n\nOVA is great from a rules light standpoint but in some aspects I have a hard time calling it super light in scenarios like: Say you have inventor- it makes you start with a modern marvel. Take vehicle- which gives you x2 the points in vehicle to make one. Then you have to build each of the vehicle's weapons. In this aspect I don’t feel its that much easier than BESM- but BESM just has more stuff (that hopefully your GM looked at pre campaign and said what was and wasn’t legal which is also a step you take in OVA).\n\nOVA also - in my opinion - I felt like there were a lack of good choices when it came to weaknesses. Particularly as you had to use the same list to make mecha as you did with a person. I also didnt like how- there is no real difference between health points and endurance points when it comes to combat. If you are out of health, you continue fighting at -1 but further damage is taken from endurance (vice versa). I dont really like that as much because it does not feel like weaknesses that reduce health are as detrimental as they could be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBESM 3 seems like a lot- but its a situation where there are a lot of options and you pare down what you need for your game. You can play like 1st edition with attributes only - no skills, no shock value, etc. It tends to fit my 'id rather have something and not need it than want something and need to find a way to do it' mentality."", 'I have no idea about OVA but it would have to be pretty impressively bad to be worse than BESM.', 'I never played OVA but the one thing about BESM that impressed me was it’s vehicle and technology design rules based on points like characters are. Before BESM all I seem in that respect RPG wise was burps complex algebraic approach to vehicle design.', ""I've played a lot of BESM and always enjoyed it.  I've only read through OVA, but it never hooked me.  OVA seemed like it a weird middle ground where it was trying to have freeform character traits, but still a list of specific traits with specific abilities.  In the end it felt like it had a big list of abilities that all worked the same.  BESM has a lot of mechanical variety where you can, for example, choose if an attack uses energy, has a limited number of shots, requires a cool-down period, causes collateral damage, etc.\n\nIf I was going to go with OVA, I'd probably take it further and just use Fate or Cortex Prime.  BESM scratches a more fiddly mechanical itch for me.  The base mechanics just make more sense to me and I've never really had trouble balancing it with a little oversight.  It's got lots of different mechanical widgets to play with and it's fairly easy to adjust them all."", ""It's going to depend on a number of preferences.  If you're a rules-lite fan, OVA is going to be a better fit.  OVA is far easier on teh rules, although I found it a touch clunky to learn.\n\nBESM, depending on the edition, can get a bit heavy on the crunch during creation, but runs fairly easy in play.  3e, which is my specialty, has a lot of room to customize characters and abilities.  You can build a lot of different concepts, although balance is pretty loose and not always well done.  However, I found it easy to learn, which is a big plus for teaching it to people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankfully, the PDFs for either are fairly inexpensive ($10 each), so it's not a drastic cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFYI, **do not bother with BESM d20**.  It was nothing short of an abomination and should be nuked from orbit and erased from history.  It combined the worst aspects of d20 and point-buy systems.  BESM fans often like to forget it existed..."", ""Never played BESM, but I've run a ~6 month game with OVA.\n\nOVA is pretty simple and fairly rules light. It's really easy to make exactly the character you want and it's very free-form and flavor malleable. Not as much as something like Fate, but much closer to Fate than DnD or Savage Worlds.\n\nThere are a couple problems with the mechanics, loopholes and such, so if you're playing with a power gamer or two you might need to keep an eye on them. But it's a pretty good system, especially if you're looking for something explicitly anime themed and don't want to do the work of specializing something like Fate.\n\nEdit: Definitely recommend Fate Core or Fate Accelerated over either for universal systems though. You can do a reasonable facsimile of Fudge Dice by doubling the numbers and just rolling 3d6, though most people like to leave the numbers the same and roll 2d6-2d6 or 1d6-1d6 when they don't use Fudge Dice.\n\nSavage Worlds is a little crunchier, but still maybe worth a look. Especially if you want to roll different sized dice on occasion. It's my second favorite system after Fate at the moment. It's a bit grittier than BESM or OVA, though, losing characters is easier and characters trend closer to average human ability unless you use some of the companion books."", ""BESM is fantastic for character building. the rules for Magic, Tech, Equipment, And Vehicles are all versatile and powerful\n\nI've built monster hunter weapons with complete move sets; I built Ruby for a friend of mine; tons of Jets and Mecha.

rpg,t3_a4qxoy,"A generalized system-independent RPG character creator, MakeRPGHi, I'm rather new to reddit and brand new to r/rpg, so please be gentle.  I read the r/rpg rules and I also looked at r/RPGdesign, but I think this is the right subreddit to post this general announcement and request for feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

**A quick intro**: I have always enjoyed playing tabletop/pen-and-paper RPG's with friends, but I have always found character creation to be a hurdle to starting a campaign or a one-off session.  The time it takes to make a character you like that gels with the system or setting takes away from play time.  I hate that.  So I decided to take some of my programming experience and put it to good hobby use.

&amp;#x200B;

**The idea**: Simple, an automatic character creator for any game system.  I know the details are hard.  But I've got an open-source ""alpha"" pre-release/prototype version complete with online documentation and my hobby time dedicated to it.  I'm super-interested in getting feedback about what features are important to people besides me and my friends and spending time improving it.

&amp;#x200B;

**What it does right now**: ""Out of the box"" it can make Cyberpunk 2020 characters because that is my favorite setting so I used it as my first test case (and included the example for others to use).  I'm asking my friends to try it out on their favorite game systems and share their configuration files to the code repository on GitHub.  It could be done with unpublished game systems too.  It currently supports randomly generating Characters with names, roles, stats, skills, history, and related NPC's (who get their own names, roles, stats, skills, and history too).  It takes about 5-10 seconds per NPC, so my average character creation speeds are about 3-4 minutes for 5 full characters with all their related NPC's.

&amp;#x200B;

**What's next**: I want to branch out in the future to handling things like inventory, weapon, and armor generation too, but that's obviously a ways off because it would require a ""database"" so-to-speak of all those items to randomly select from and purchase for any given system.  I also want to allow for more user-customization like, ""bias rolls low/medium/high for these stats/skills"" or just forcing a change of a stat or skill value.  The other thing I will do sooner than later is make a Character or NPC search/filter where you can take whatever set of randomly generated characters you have and filter them by things like ""this role"" or ""has this stat or skill at greater/less than (or equal to) some number"", etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lastly**: Thanks for reading!  I'll watch this thread for thoughts/feedback or you can reach out to me directly on reddit or GitHub.  I would love to start collecting bugs and more feature requests for my web interface, code, and documentation.

The difference is the initiative systems, and that changes the fundamental flow of the game.\n\nv1 was a typical roll a d10, add a bonus, everyone takes a turn each round. Re-roll every round. And there is not persistent defense. i.e. everyone is the same difficulty to hit, unless they spend actions to defend.\n\nv2 was an ability roll for count of successes. Then we invert that count. Whoever rolled highest starts with zero, and everyone else goes on tick (highest roll - their roll). Then what action you take on your turn determines how many ticks pass before your next turn. e.g. If you just move, you act again in 3 ticks, a weapon attack is usually 5 ticks (could be 3 to 6). And you now have a defense rating which is lowered by actions you take, and refreshes on your next turn.\n\nv3 has two types of attack. One steals initiative from your opponent, and two uses your collected initiative to then do real damage. Anything less than a Hero vs Villain fight is treated as mass combat. e.g. One character makes a roll to destroy the enemy army, while the next character gets to face-off with the opposing general.\n\nPersonally, I love v1 and v2, and hate v3 with the burning passion of a thousand suns. Some people like it, and I applaud them for keeping the company going.\n\nThe good thing about all editions is the plot all starts in the same place.

You can convert PCs/NPCs from one edition to another, but it does take quite a lot of familiarity with both. Equipment, vehicles, and spaceships are also designed in an entirely different way, but that's usual between editions of Traveller. T5, Marc Miller's new version, is also a dramatic change from the previous official edition (Mongoose's Traveller could fairly be described as a hybrid of Classic Traveller and MegaTraveller)."", ""7th Sea.\n\nThe new edition is a completely different game.

I don't have time to write a story, so I only want to run the game if I can find one pre-written.

I was also looking at Paranoia, but my friend has played way more Paranoia than I have and I don't know which scenarios to pick.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a4q4mf/in_spaaace/,"['...in Spaaace! is the sort of game where you really, really shouldn\'t be thinking in terms of a written story. The GM has so little control that it has to be improvised as you go - but the players will do as much of that improvisation as you do.\n\nSo what you need is a basic situation to start with. I\'d actually start the first session by doing character creation together - you just say ""this is silly space stuff, go wild!"" and let them build characters. As they do, they might inspire you to come up with a scenario - one wants to play a space pirate, so obviously there\'s a spirate rival out there; someone has poor peasant parents on a fungus farming asteroid, maybe the overseer is being too greedy and they\'ve called for help; or a character is maxed out on charm and seduction traits, so you start the game with them in bed with someone\'s spouse, and now there\'s a jealous husband with mob connections after one of you.\n\nIf you don\'t get any good ideas out of them, start with a standard adventure sort of thing - they\'re all small time smugglers/pirates/cargo haulers with a small spaceship, and at the moment they\'re scavenging a wreck they\'ve found, when suddenly the alarm goes off! It\'s (a) the dead crew of the wreck wake up! Space Zombies!, (b) a rival crew! will they fight us? will we work fast to get away before they get here? Ask if the PCs have relationships - of hate or rivalry or love or family - with any of the rival crew; or (c) it\'s the police! we don\'t have a permit. Can we convince them we\'re legitimate? Can we bribe them? Fight our way out?\n\nChaos ensues.\n\nWhenever you want to insert new material - say they\'ve negotiated a truce with the rival crew, each crew is going to stick to one half of the ship - prefer moving to a different situation rather than making the current situation deeper. So you could have a plot in the rival crew to mutiny, and have the PCs dragged into the mess, but it\'s more in the style of hi-jinks space nonsense to just move on: The crew leaves and returns to their home asteroid, but are framed for a crime and have to convince the Duke they didn\'t do it. Or, on the way home they discover a stowaway - it\'s the princess, she\'s run away from home, you have to help her escape. Shake it up often, but bring back old NPCs (the rival crew help you out / hinder you at some later stage).\n\nDive in head first, and trust the mess to be hilarious.\n\nEDIT: Greg\'s homepage has a small [scenario](http://www.gregstolze.com/revengeisadish.zip) you could run. It\'s mostly just some pregenerated characters, but they\'ve got a bit of backstory for you to draw from, and there are some notes on how you could run it.']"

rpg,t3_a4prgm,"Need a name for aHey everybody,

I’m running a game based in the City of Providence, the capital of Rhode Island. The game deals with a mirror universe that is a twisted and evil reflection of our world. Everything has a counterpart in the mirror universe.

Anyway, I’m trying to come up with an appropriate name for the mirror version of Providence. While it could simply just call it “Providence,” the people of the mirror universe have a tendency to re-name the locations in their worlds. The new name is typically a play on the city, one of its nicknames, or something it’s known for. For instance, Chicago (The “Windy City”) is called “Typhoon” in the mirror universe.
Consequently, I need a name for an evil, demonic Providence. 

For a little background info, Providence is known by locals as the “Divine City” and the “Renaissance City”. It was founded by a Puritan exile named Roger Williams who left England in search of religious freedom. In its early years, the city was a haven for various misfits of the time - Quakers, Baptists, pirates, criminals, etc. The city is the birth place of H.P. Lovecraft.

rpg,t3_a4nin8,"Need some advice on planning and running sessions.EDIT: To specify: I'm running a game in M&amp;m 3e system (superheroes, kinda). Propably should've said that from the start, oops.

&amp;#x200B;

So, in short I've been trying to GM for quite some time, with mediocre results. Among other things, my issues include two things:

* Preparing the game
* Dealing with unexpected player choices

As for preparation, after nearly two years I still have no idea what should be prepared for a session. Outside of the basics, like NPC's and locations, I have to idea how to plan a story. I'm not good at improv (more about it later) and just coming up with the story on the spot seriously puts me on edge. On the other hand, I cannot plot a story path and expect players to follow it unless I railroad in the most heavy-handed way.

Simply put, I have no idea what should I have ready when the session starts? A rough idea of how things should unfold? A plan accounting for 2-3 broad outcomes? Just the various elements of the world (NPC goals etc.)?

I've encountered issues with each of these approaches and by now I pretty much dread having to write notes for the next session.

&amp;#x200B;

As for choices, well... Like I said, improv is not my strongest suit. All too often I find myself in a situation where players either latch onto something utterly irrelevant (ex. a place that has nothing to do with the plot) or do something that throws the entire story into a complete disarray.

Example of the first: they are searching for a missing guy and ignoring other hints they decide to check his apartment (which doesn't have hints and that I didn't give any thought). Example of the second: players are investigating a sabotage and decide to blow up a wall in front of the security. Both have ended up with me changing my plans, and coming up with something on the spot to prevent the story from hitting a dead end or flat out ending, but both times this caused the story to go into meaningless tangents and/or forced me to completely change/add parts of the story, making it an inconsistent mess within 5 sessions.

&amp;#x200B;

These issues combined, I can usually start a campaign strong, but after just a few sessions it starts dragging on (I've noticed that a some point only 2-3 scenes happen over a 4 hour session and the plot barely moves on) whilst I slowly lose a grip on what is actually going on in the story and don't know how to even set up the next session.

Any advice is appreciated, thanks in advance.

Edit 2: FOR EVERYONE SUGGESTING RANDOM TABLES: I don't have any issues with creating plots, I don't need any inspiration and sure as hell I don't need more random elements to make this story even harder to run. My problem is how to prepare and deal with story going in an unexpected direction, last thing I need is using dice rolls to introduce random b*llshit that I'll have to later justify.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a4nin8/need_some_advice_on_planning_and_running_sessions/,"['I think the problem is you’re trying so hard not to railroad them that you’re not pulling them into your story. I think one of the problems a lot of GMs have is that you think your job is to write a great story and then show it to the players, but really your job is to facilitate a communal story being told by the group. \n\nMy preference is to keep things really simple, have a few plots hooks the players can latch onto and let the story progress organically. Let the players decide their direction, and if you have a bigger story to tell, find ways of filtering it into your plot hooks. If the players don’t bite, that’s okay, they go onto whatever the next thing is they want to do. \n\nThe most important thing to remember is that the game isn’t about your story, it’s about everyone having fun. If your players latch onto something tangental, go with it, keep things simple and try to close the story with a solid end point so they move on. You don’t want to pull the players away from the thing they’re interested in.\n\nFinally, improvising, our GM has a great system for keeping this simple using random tables. Put together your own random tables for loot, character traits, encounters, gods, character names, whatever you need. You should never have to have a whole book detailed in your head. If you get silly things on the random table, lean into it. Sometimes the silly or strange things are more memorable for being out of place. ', 'Make tangents meaningful. Move clues to wherever they go.  Plan problems, not solutions.', ""Simple solution: Tell players that you don't like improv and that you prefer to run a linear story. If that's a problem for your players, they can leave. You can always find players who are willing to buy in to your linear story.\n\nIf the players decide to stick around, and then actively try to derail your story, kick them out."", 'Check out never unprepared, focal point, and unframed.\n\nhttps://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/3323/Engine-Publishing', ""Here are some tips that helped me GM, I always had trouble with improv so I can empathise:\n\n-Focus on building settings and characters, with only a loose plot to keep things going that you can adapt to the players actions. Build a town with four different districts, each with different locales, shops and opportunities and leaders. Doesn't have to be exhaustive prep, but something simple like 'Chinatown has got lots of vampires hiding there, the business district is all about money and corporations, the Stretch is full of gangs and the Suburbs are full of werewolves and weapons smugglers'. Then you need to come up with an NPC vampire, werewolf, gang leader, corporate fixer and weapon smuggler and give everyone a reason to want to interact with your players. Make your players aware of these settings/characters through rumours and knowledge checks, and you'll be surprised hour often players will go and investigate. If players are spending a lot of time with one area/npc then you can have one of the others burst in unexpectedly to alter the plot (i.e. Corporate meeting gets interrupted by gang leader who demands corporate guy return an old favour. Or Gun Smuggler's daughter is secretly a vampire.). If you start doing this you'll find more and more plot opportunities come along, and you can tailor the story to your players (maybe your thief characters brother owes the gangleader a lot of money and needs help). This approach to GMing will take time to get used to so maybe start small, creating one small part of town and an NPC there that doesn't relate to your main plot... Yet\n\n-Immerse yourself in the fiction. If it's set somewhere specific, read books and media and watch YouTube lore videos about that setting. If it's a generic setting, read fiction from that genre. This arms you for improv and lets you quickly pull out characters, settings, descriptions and plots from the stories you've read. Often a simple name change and none of your players will be any wiser. No one can improv huge plots out of thin air. The best improvvers reuse stuff they've seen or heard before and present it in a new setting. Don't feel like you need to personally create every aspect of the world yourself; that's way too much work.\n\n-I've had a lot of success with random rollable tables. Check out /r/d100 for some inspiration/tables to use. I've built up my tables over the years for my setting so I've got stuff for everything - name generators, NPC character trait generators, travel encounters, shipboard encounters, random low, mid and high level loot, even plot hooks (if I'm really stuck). They help me keep things fresh and improvisational - plus if my players decide to go somewhere unexpected I can quickly generate characters, encounters and loot for them as if I'd planned for it all along.\n\n-Have a backup encounter planned in case you need to buy time. Your players go somewhere unexpected? Now is the time for their rival to appear out of nowhere, Gary Oak-style and attack them. With any luck resolving that encounter will take until the end of the session which will give you plenty of time to plan and build to accomodate this unexpected twist. Doing this well takes practice, otherwise it can feel quite shoehorned and abrupt. An example is your players decide to leave the major town with all the characters and npcs and go to the next town. You have nothing planned, so they meet some farmers that are being hunted by night by a werewolf and they need your help. Even if they don't want to help, you can have the werewolf attack them at night - they were warned one was around after all. This delaying encounter will give you more time to plan the next setting. Just make it's still fun to deal with (give them minor loot, maybe?) so that it doesn't feel like an obstacle but just another part of their big adventure. \n\n-Between sessions, think of ways to string all the different plots that are cooking together. The downfall of improv plots is that they often become quite messy and complex which can be confusing/boring for players. If you see an opportunity to tie a plot event to another one, definitely do so. Maybe the thief's brother is strong armed into an assassination attempt on the corporate fixer in exchange for wiping away his debts - while your players are meeting with him. Do they save the corporate stooge or the player's brother? Again this can be tricky to do naturally, but you'd be surprised at what you can get away with. \n\n-Finally, don't be afraid to talk to your players. What do they want? What kind of plots/characters/situations do they like/dislike? Where do they see their characters going? This info can help you introduce new elements that your players will definitely be interested in as a result. If one player is interested in necromancy, maybe introduce a famous necromancer who's dying without an heir over the next few sessions. Another good thing to do at the end of the session is to ask the players what their next move is, so you can plan for it in your down time. Some players like to keep their plans secret from the GM in order to 'outwit' them. Make it clear that them that the more they share about their plans the more fun a scenario you can create for them. If they just want to screw with you and catch you offguard all the time then it'll probably just make for a weak, boring campaign in the long run. \n\nThat's about it - good luck! "", ""From your replies on this thread, it sounds like some of the stress comes from you trying to run games with an investigation focus where the players don't pick up on enough clues to make progress. As a result, they tend to stall out and get sidetracked on things that they think are the main investigation but aren't, forcing you to make things up on the spot while keeping everything consistent.\n\nDoes that sound right?\n\nOne thing to consider is to shift the focus of the investigations. The broad steps of an investigation are:\n\n1. Find out that something's wrong\n2. Gather clues about what's wrong and who or what is responsible\n3. Come to a conclusion about the culprit\n4. Decide how to deal with the culprit and act on it\n\nClassic whodunnit mystery stories focus on 1-3, and step 4 can be as small as a paragraph of epilogue. From what you've described, it sounds like your players are bogging down on steps 1 and 2. Think about whether you and the rest of your group are really enjoying this investigation focus.\n\nIf you're not, since you're playing superheroes you can have the villains go big and obvious. e.g. Dr. Evilguy set off a device in the city center that's summoning alien bat-things. Fight to the center and destroy the device. Throw in options about which buildings they want to save, and have them deal with the aftermath in future sessions.\n\nIf your group is interested in some investigation but don't want it to be the focus, make step 1 the initial hook of the scenario (there are weird bat-things attacking the city!), then make steps 2-3 easier and spend most of your time on step 4. A more thorough investigation in step 2 might give the party more or better options in step 4. e.g. If they go straight for the device they can explode both it and the city center. If they spend some time gathering clues, they find the bat-device can be disabled using X and Y technology, which will suck the bats back in but leave the possibility of them returning. If the team goes for disabling, now they have to prepare X and Y while limiting the effects of the alien invasion.\n\nThe blog series [No Clues Without Consequence](https://medium.com/no-clues-without-consequence/no-clues-without-consequence-5ae0a67c0fb7) is a good breakdown of investigation scenario design, seen through the lens of the Gumshoe system. The design advice is applicable for any system."", 'I read the other comments, trying to deduce what you need and what you want, and I want to try my best. Note that I don\'t know the specific setting, nor I have GMed more than one-shots or shorts campaign with superheroes (but I ran both sandboxes and more long ""railroaded"" campaigns), therefore take this with a grain of salt.\n\nYou don\'t want random. Random is the contrary of order. You want order, and you want control, because you are the Master. And to master is to know and be in control of all the unliving and the living things but 3-4 (the players). \n\nRolling dice and create things on the fly is the opposite of order, and may do a mess with what you have established. So no random of sort. Only hard work, because for what I\'ve read, you are willing to engage the hard path to create the best experience for your players.\n\n\n**Etymology**\n\nImprovisation is ""the ability to create something that wasn\'t seen before"". Unseen... but by whom? By the players and their characters. You, as the master, have to know the 100%, all the possible outcomes. Not because you want a choose-your-path adventure, but because you have to react to their actions in the most realistic way.\n\n**Past**\n\nFirst of all, take a photo of your players notes. All of them. Then sort them, summarize, create an unified document to keep track of their progression, and what they know, updating it after every session. Compare it to your plot and hooks, which are in another document. \n\nThen, reimagine your plot without the character interventions. What force is driving and keeping it moving? If not stopped, what will be results? And why this driving force (or driving forces) is doing what it is doing?\n\n**Future**\n\nTo master is to control the world, therefore acting as GM is worldbuilding. But the world is not only spacial. The world is the sum of all phenomena, of all the possible events. Therefore, acting as a GM is event-building. Each event is composed by a location, a time, and one or more actions, performed by one or more NPC.\n\nEven in a more ""railroaded"" game, you have to plan events. We aren\'t God, we haven\'t the seventh day to rest. We always have to create. Each time you have an idea, a couple of words, a location, or something else, write it down. Shamelessy steal good idea from books, shows, videogames, everything that you find cool. Obvioysly, first you will have disjointed phrases, vague concepts, and no idea what to do with them.\n\nBut as soon as you have enough of them, you will see lines, links between some of them, eveey one providing an answer to a different question (Who? What? When? Where? How?)\n\n*Vampiric dog. Shopping mall, full of people... because... it is the Pre-Christmas period. Bluethug: a gang of drug dealers. That should\'t have been there!*\n\nI think you have, at least, a vague idea of a possible event, if not an almost full-fleshed story. Then, you have to choose if the events has or doesn\'t have a link to your story. \n\n- ""Why?"" Is the ""because"" related to your plot? If you want this event to reinforce your plot, you have to ground a reason onto the antagonistic force. Why is it benefical to your villain? What will he achieve with this event, if not altered by the heroes, what  will he possibly lose if altered by the heroes, and what will he possibly gain if altered by the heroes? *The drug dealers have been tasked by the BBEG to test an experimental drug on animals, but the dog escaped and now is dangerous and blood seeking: it is going to the shppping mall to satiate its hunger, and the drug dealers have to stop and capture it, if they want their payment/not-be-destroyed-by-the-BBEG. They aren\'t strong enough: without the heroes, there will be a slaughter"".\n\n- But sometimes these events have a very small ""why"", and are not directly related to the antagonistic force. They have to answer their question in no more than two sessions (one or, better, half session would be enough). *The dog of one of the drug dealer eat the experimental drug, escaped and is going to go berserk in the shopping mall. Maybe they will expose themselves to stop it, or they won\'t risk their life. Whatever they do, without the heroes, many will die*\n\n2 out of 3 events should have a ""why"" answered by the main plot. Only 1 of 3 or 4 are ""sidequests"", red herrings, something that is not related to the plot: this is realistic (not everything is the BBEG\'s fault) and doesn\'t derail the plot (because the event is completed in 0,5 to 2 session, and comes out only once every three or four meaningful events).\n\nSome of these events may happen at a specific time. Keep track of the time progression. If the BBEG is secretly  building an enormous death ray inside a skyscraper, it will fire in 10 sessions without the interference of the heroes (in the meantime, they should trigger some event to inform them about something suspect regarding that skyscraper...). When the death ray wil kill a quarter of the city, the heroes will have to deal with it (and therefore, follow your plot).\n\nYou should have half a dozen events always ready (4 plot events, 2 not related), and one or two time events (as described above) ""charging"" each session/in-game time.\n\n**Present**\n\nYour players decide to disregard the obvious clue you left them about the location of the BBEG, and  decide to go investigating a theater, because ""the BBEG has a Phantom of the Opera like mask, naturally he lives under the theater"" [I wish this was completely made up... but it happened to me, just a couple of month ago, *sigh*]\n\nWrong things to do: \n\n- ""Ah ah! This was the BBEG location the whole time!""\n\n- Rabdom events\n\nQueationable but not enterely wrong thing to do:\n\n- They find nothing. But the show was very good.\n\nInteresting thing to do:\n\n- Control your list of event and select an appropriate one.\n\nBut you don\'t have anything about a theater! What to do? Select a similar event a slightly modify one or a couple of answers. \nWe take our berserk dog, and change shopping mall to theater. Now it is destroying the stage to attack the actors (during the play the characters are watching! ""What cool special effects! It really seems to be killing th- ohmygoditiseatingtheirheads!!!""). The fighting ensues, and when the players win they find the dog tag with the address of one of the drug dealers, or they find the drug dealers just arrived to the theater. Now they can go and interrogate the drug dealers, receiving clues to the BBEG if the event answered a ""why"", or at least stopping to worry about the theater.\n\nAnd that\'s it. Maintain a reserve of events, and replace them each time you use one. Never stop to create, write everything that inspires you.\n\nSorry for the long post, I hope to not have wasted your time, and, I remain eager to answer every possible question or doubt.', ""Keep it simple, create one main goal for the group, maybe 2-3 sideplots that characters can explore. That way if the players don't pursue your main goal but a side plot, you still have something prepared.

rpg,t3_a4lubx,"Any idea for a prehistorical RPG ?(sorry if there are some mistakes here, I am French and my English is far from perfect)

Hi everyone,

I have been working on a game for almost 2 years now (not full-time at all, of course). It takes place in a prehistorical set, more precisely around 11,500 BC. I chose this specific era because it has seen a big evolution of human technologies and ways of life. I am always looking for any kind of ideas, for game mechanics, scenarios, environment, and I think you are a huge source of creativity.  


For the next paragraphs, I explain the background and the game itself ; it's only a summary, my actual notes are pages and pages. Here is a small plan so you don't have to read everything if you look for a specific information \^\^:

1. Human society in 11,500 BC
2. Technology and medicine
3. Religion, superstition and confrontation with death
4. The mindset of the game (quite important)
5. Playable species and classes
6. Magic
7. Enemies
8. Quests

&amp;#x200B;

1 - Human society in 11,500 BC

Human beings (who were Homo Sapiens, like us) live in tribes and are mostly nomadic, moving when needed and rebuilding their homes from caves, wood, bones and skins in another place. The sizes of the tribes are from 20 to a few hundred people. Men are mostly hunters-gatherers and women mostly stay in the village, building, crafting and taking care of children, food, fireplaces. Tribes were very different one to another in the way they used to work, but it is very important to note that in most cases, men were used to fight, hunt and take risks while women were teachers, artisans, doctors, shamans etc. Therefore, the tribe chiefs and shamans were often women and, in some tribe wars, men used to abduct women from another tribe to steal all the technology they knew.

&amp;#x200B;

2 - Technology and medicine

11,500 BC was the end of the paleolithic period. It has been the birth of agriculture, settlement, bows and arrows, harpoons, sewing needles (used to assemble skins to make clothes), polishing and (therefore) blades. As all of these is new, not all the tribes know it, which can lead to funny situations like everybody from a stranger tribe wondering what in hell the bows of the PCs actually are. Medicine was mostly curing simple things (like pain or infection) with plants without knowing how it works. Surgery existed, but mostly amputations and trepanation (with an impressively low death rate (but very high in our standards), with some people actually surviving 3 trepanations in their lives).

&amp;#x200B;

3 - Religion, superstition and confrontation with death

By looking at their art, we know that some cavemen from this era had gods, often represented by statuettes or totems, but most of the time they just had superstitions, maybe believing in spirits of the nature. An example of those superstitions is that some tribes, before burying their member's dead bodies, used to break their legs so that they cannot rise from the dead (and THIS is creepy). Generally speaking, they had a lot of respect for dead people.

&amp;#x200B;

4 - The mindset of the game (the important part!)

The main idea of the game is to make a creepy and almost scary experience, showing how these times could be terrifying and dirty. For instance, players have HPs, but those only show what amount of blood was lost and how the vital organs are destroyed. Therefore, the loss of HPs is not the worst when you get hit: the worst is potential infections and gangrenes from the wound, broken bones or even a direct hit to the head, which can one-shot you like in real life. The purpose of this is that when an ennemy threatens the players with a weapon , the players are not like ""this is fine"" and go berserk. Any hit can kill or disable you if you are unlucky or do not have the correct medicine. The game should be creepy, dirty and show a raw, cruel, nightmarish reality where you struggle to dodge the most painful death.

The game will differ from reality to add a little bit of magic

&amp;#x200B;

5 - Playable species and classes

Currently, the only playable species is Human, but I am working on adding the Pygmies, 3-feet people who live at the top of the trees (they are called squirrel-men) or underground, in huge gallery networks (they are called ant-men), and adding the Rock-Skins, people who live in cold environments and high altitudes, who eat rocks, dirt and wood and whose skin turn to rock as they get old. The 6 classes of the humans are:

* The warrior (no need to explain)
* The hunter-gatherer (a warrior specialized in hunting and surviving in the wild)
* The artisan (who builds and repair things)
* The shaman / witch doctor (who knows medicine and makes magical powders, potions etc. out of ingredients (that can be normal, like specific leaves, or creppy, going from crushed teeth and sabertooth blood to child blood) to help allies (curing wounds and infections, making strength potions) or attack ennemies (making them go crazy, kill each other or feel an intense pain))
* The sorcerer / witch (who manipulates magic, see paragraph 6)
* The druid (who communicates with the nature).

&amp;#x200B;

6 - Magic

The sorcerer's magic follows the seven elements. I did not want the elements to be the classical air-water-earth-fire, but to be elements as cavemen could understand them ; elements are everything ""magic"" and hard to understand in a caveman's life: water, fire, rock (including ground and plants), sky (including weather), life (which is actually *moving* life, like humans, animals), night (including darkness and fear) and decay (including rot, diseases, infections, madness, hunger, pain and death).

&amp;#x200B;

7 - Enemies

The idea of the game is not to have great monsters or things like that, but other tribes and prehistorical animals from this era, which is more than enough to have many different enemies and kinds of fights. The prehistorical animals are taken from all the animals that have lived on Earth from 100,000 BC to 5,000 BC, regardless to the location on Earth ; this is not the most realistic way to do it but gives more choice when choosing the enemies. A prehistorical adventure is way more entertaining when fighting mammoths, giant eagles and giant sloths, than dragons and golems :)

&amp;#x200B;

8 - Quests

Following the same mindset, the quests are about saving your life and your tribe, but not to save the entire world, as you don't even know how it looks like. It is a lot on a limited scale, and the life of every single ally is very significant.

For example, I have made a scenario (that I am playing with my friends) in which the heroes, followed by an enemy tribe, are forced to cross the ""Great End"", a mountain range said to be the end of the world. On the other side of the mountains, there is no end of the world but other tribes with very different cultures and that do not have the technology of the bow. The goal of the players is to survive in the wild, find shelters and cross back the mountains fast enough to warn their tribe about a potential attack of the enemy tribe (I skip the details).

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you VERY much for your attention, I take any suggestion, question, advice about this game.

Alternatively: Whats a good system that lends it self well to Westerns?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a4l67q/what_are_the_essential_elements_every_western/,"['Thematically:\n\n1. Isolation - Westerns are all about huge distances to travel between places. Ranches are an afternoon\'s ride from the nearest town, towns are days of travel apart, and anytime you see someone they might mean trouble for you or they may be a friend.\n\n2. The landscape - Every good western has sweeping vistas. Tall mountains, horizons that are miles and miles away, vast empty land that you\'ll never be able to tame.\n\n3. Man against nature. Mom\'s bigger, scarier, and nastier than you. Flash floods in the deserts, dying of thirst because of no fresh water, bear and other wild animal attacks, lightning strikes, hail storms that come out of nowhere and smash your skull in or kill your horse, sudden cold fronts that can freeze you to death in your sleep.\n\n4. Bandits and gunmen. Men who the law can\'t stop without a whole posse.\n\n5. The groups no one talks about (IMO): Buffalo soldiers, the ""civilized"" tribes, the Mormons, the women who were outlaws.\n\n6. Reinvention - People went West to change their fortunes. You never went out there because things were great back East. So you were running from an old life, a bad past. You had men who were educated who went out to have an adventure. You had women who went because they hadn\'t gotten married yet and had no other options back east (can\'t vote, can\'t have jobs, can\'t contribute so they just ended up as spinsters back east).\n\nI think that\'s all I\'ve got. Rules-wise, I would DEFINITELY have a survival and food mechanic. If you don\'t have water or food or a horse, you\'re pretty much dead out west.\n\nIf you have Netflix, watch *Godless*. It\'s a mini-series, I think about 8 hours long in total, but it\'s probably one of the best westerns ever made. It feels modern in its film-making, but it\'s such a great homage to all the 50s, 60s, and 70s westerns, and gives you the feel of how wide open the range was, and the sudden violence that can happen (not to mention the bizarre characters you might meet).\n\nAlso, *Ballad of Buster Scrugs*, *True Grit*, *The Wild Bunch*, *Unforgiven*, *The Outlaw Josey Wales*, *Deadwood*, and *Lonesome Done*. *Hell on Wheels* is a good one, too, but I douubt you have time for all five seasons.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but I\'m kind of a Western fan.', 'A town of insufficient size for both the party and their main antagonists', 'Rules wise: shootouts and fanning a revolver. \nThematically: The heroes bringing order to the frontier without ever being able to reaping the benefits of that order.', 'Big players like cattle and mine barons against the common folk.\n\nNative tribes that may or may not be friendly.\n\nWildlife that is out to kill you, along with the weather and environment.

They are ugly, fast draws and have warrants wanted dead or alive.\n\nYour horse is your greatest asset and friend, along with your pistol...\n\nFor atmosphere really the western is about individuality and a lot of isolation.

rpg,t3_a4klle,"Advice for playing with childrenI have three children (5-year-old girl, a 7-year-old boy, 10-year-old girl) and we like playing games together.

I've never played Role Playing Games but thought I'd try to get into some simple ones with the children.

We play things like Zombie Dice, King of Tokyo, Werewolf, Welcome to the Dungeon, Pandemic, Carcassone. (My 5-year-old doesn't play all the games on her own, but likes to take part)

I don't really want to spend loads of money on full D&amp;D and then have to learn how to play it myself and then confuse them. What are some fairly cheap entry level games I could learn myself and then act as GM for them?

My idea in the short term is to get out my Fighting Fantasy books and read through them allowing them to make the choices. Does that sound like it might work?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a4klle/advice_for_playing_with_children/,"['[No Thank You, Evil!](http://www.nothankyouevil.com/) from Monte Cook Games is aimed squarely at kids. The system is basically ""Numenera-lite"". I\'ve run it for players as young as 4 and it worked pretty well. It has a nice scaling complexity so the younger kids don\'t have to worry about much in the system, while the older kids have more options. \n\nOne of the things I think is fun about this is that the game encourages kids to *run* it as well. How much of a hoot would it be to have your kids run some sessions and you play in them?\n\n', 'Got a few recommendations, hopefully it’s not an overload!\n\n[Amazing Tales](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/222950)  was made by a guy who wanted a scaled down rpg to play with his kids and it seems pretty cool. \n~~I think this game uses only d6’s~~\nEdit: Pointed out below that this system uses d6 through d12. (Thanks for the correction!)\n\nA lot of John Harper’s one page rpgs are very cool and simple (mechanically). I’d call attention specifically to Lasers &amp; Feelings because then you get a ton of different genre offshoots done by other people. \n[Lasers and Feelings and other hacks](http://writingalchemy.net/resources/lasers-and-feelings-hacks/) \nMost of John’s games use just d6’s\n\n[Kids on Bikes](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/231938) uses this reimagined genre of Kids on Bikes solving mysteries in their small town thing in media. Meant to be set in the 80s or a time when cell phones weren’t available. Let’s the players share a supernatural character that can get introduced. \nUses a full set of gaming dice for your stats so you get to use them all. \n\n[Tales From the Loop](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/210617) is similar to Kids on Bikes but is set in a weird sort of alternate history world where technology advanced pretty quickly but due to some dangers the Loops were shut down. Now there’s giant deactivated robots on the landscape and things like that. So sort of stranger things meets sci-fi. Pluses here are the system inherently says ‘The Kids don’t die’. They can get stressed or hurt but they suffer different emotional states that can be relieved through hanging out with the other kids and hugging it out. \nUses pools of d6’s. \n\n[Golden Sky Stories](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/118784) has your characters playing as animal spirits turned people helping normal folks with their problems in their village. It’s a sort of slice of life anime type rpg. I haven’t played it yet but it seems like a fun game and gets a lot of praise. \n\n[The 200 Word RPG Challenge](https://200wordrpg.github.io) is loaded with some great games written using only 200 words. The full lists are pretty large so I’d recommend sticking to the finalists and winners and looking for titles that catch your interest. A lot of these I can’t use because they require playing in person and I do online only but they seem pretty cool. \n\n[The Tearable RPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/202680) is a fun tactile game where you actually are ripping your character sheet to succeed at tasks. Another free one. Might be tough for the little one but obviously exceptions could be made on their tears :)\n\nLastly I’d say [Savage Worlds](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/92743). It’s a bit heavier though than the others games I’ve mentioned but it doesn’t feel that way in play. It’s a generic system that can do any type of game that you’d want. It is a great sort of mid weight system that uses each of the dice in a gaming set up to a d12 (the d20 is used for rolling on a Fear Effects table). It’s quick, it’s got lots of extra stuff if you want to use it or for those that really want the most, but it also is completely playable without getting into all of that. You’re basically rolling your Trait dice vs generally a Target Number of 4 to succeed. Higher results usually yield better success. If a Die is rolled on it’s highest face value it ‘Aces’ and you roll it again. This can happen as many time as you roll the highest face value and it is a blast when it happens. Savage Worlds also has a *ton* pre built settings available for it plus various Companion books for different genres. Each of these books provide new Edges, Hindrances, and Setting Rules (all of which help to reinforce the feel of that setting or genre). However Savage Worlds is perfectly capable with just the core book. \nI will point out though that a new version (Adventurer’s version) recently finished a rather successful kickstarter and the beta pdf is looking really good. That new version I’m pretty sure will be released in Spring of 2019 if I’m remembering correctly. So if any of this sounds interesting about SW you’d maybe be better off waiting to pick it up then.\n\nAnd of course if you want to get into DnD go for it. I cut my teeth on 2nd edition when I was like 10 and have played each version since. I will say this though, it’s fun and 5e is pretty great but it still is just a pain for me to run. As a lifelong gm of the various versions of dnd I’ve really grown to love the ease of running these newer and lighter games on the fly.  Even Savage Worlds which I said is mid weight is incredibly easy to stat monsters on the fly. \nNot to mention a lot of these lighter games are usually either free or very cheap.\n\nGood luck gaming with the kids! I’m looking forward to getting my 4 year old to the table too and then her brother in another couple of years :)', ""One that was recommended to me was [hero kids](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/106605/Hero-Kids--Fantasy-RPG)\n\nI bought the pdf a year ago, and haven't tried it yet. \n\n(Edit: since you like boardgames, have you checked /r/boardgames"", 'I\'ve played Fate with a 4yo, without problem. As for the topic, well, Lego Super-Heroes worked very well :)\n\nAlso, there is an entire genre of ""FIghting Fantasy book used as minimal RPGs"", so yes, that\'s entirely acceptable. My only problem is that they are quite violent.', '[My Monster, by John Wick](http://johnwickpresents.com/product/my-monster/) should be perfect for your five year old.

There are no dice, no books, just imaginations to help move the story along. I ask them what sort of character they want to play, we assume they have weapons and money, and I put them in scenarios. If they fight a monster we don\'t keep up with hp since in my mind they won\'t ever die. They will take damage because it makes the story exciting. It\'s super relaxed rules-wise but a great intro to the idea of d&amp;d. If I need help with story plots I sometimes just use Disney movies and change the names.

How he would use it is the ability to buy and sell anything for a price of course. I want this power to be extremely dangerous to the players, but also beneficial if they trick him. But I have several problems: how would I make loopholes for both him and the party expoilt? What rules should this power have? How should I reward the players for finding out the limitations of this ability organically?

If there's any other ideas for an enemy like this please tell, all advice is appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a4jwwv/devils_deal/,"[""The trick here is to make every offer it gives 'too good to be true' and come up with a way that it will come back to bite them.\n\nExample: 'I'll give you 100 gold coins if you swear not to tell anyone about any of this.' *gestures around*\n\nIf person agrees, they are forbidden from ever speaking again, because the gesture was all encompassing - i.e. he was gesturing at the world, so the person cannot talk to anyone about the world.\n\nOr the price is the death of an NPCs mother. The player knows that this mother is very old, or about to die, or possibly already dead, so they agree. Then the devil goes and kills the mother - back in time, before the NPC was born, thereby unmaking them. The devil never specified WHEN it would kill the mother, after all.\n\nOr perhaps the devil asks them to 'faithfully serve their king'. Players may already be doing this so they agree. Of course then the devil goes and possesses the king, thus making the players subservient to him.\n\nOr perhaps the devil asks the players that they must always protect a certain family from harm. Maybe even a players family. The family should be wonderful, good people that the players are already inclined to protect. As soon as they agree, reveal a bastard child that someone fathered in their youth that has grown up to be a terrible Warlord.\n\nOr maybe the devil asks them to never let any harm come to the remains of a legendary dead hero. So of course the devil somehow manages to ressurect the hero/use necromancy to reanimate their bones and go on a rampage. \n\nBasically the deal should always rely on secret knowledge of the past or the future that only the devil knows that will complicate the player's lives accordingly.\n\nBe careful with this kind of thing though - if it's not done well the players will feel cheated and abused by the GM. Make sure the players know exactly how dangerous dealing with this thing is, and give them lots of opportunities to set up loopholes and clauses of their own that they can exploit in turn. There should always be a get out clause, but it should always be very difficult to achieve. In the above king example for instance the escape clause could be 'you must serve the king until another wears his crown'. So if your players can steal his crown and wear it they'll be free. Of course the devil will probably forbid them from touching his crown, so they'll need to get creative (or hire someone to steal it).\n\nAs a rule have the devil be very crafty in setting up the deal so that they get screwed over initially, but once the damage is done have the devil be very arrogant and gloatey so that the players have a chance of turning the situation back around on it. That'll make for more fun playing and will prevent your players from feeling completely screwed by the GM over something they couldn't have seen coming.

rpg,t3_a4jh23,"Narrative Structures and Themes Other Than The Hero's Journey?I'm still fairly new to the GMing thing and I am having trouble thinking of overarching themes and narrative structures for games that aren't the Hero's Journey. While, I think that the HJ story structure is fine, I don't want to feel like I need to, or can only, run a game that makes the PCs heroes, in the traditional sense. For example, most HJ games are: Go on an adventure, experience different things, kill the BBEG, ???, profit (sorry for the gross simplification). But what could the end goal be for a more narratively open game (like an antihero game that is more morally grey or a survival type game like Mutant: Year Zero)? In my experience, it tends to be linked to the PCs trying to own something, like in Coriolis: The Third Horizon, the primary goal for the PCs is to own their ship, but that seems too empty of a goal. Simply put, this kind of goal, doesn't appear to have the same emotional or psychological impact as overcoming a BBEG is, in my opinion.

I do realize that the players are also important in determining the style of game, based on how they play, but assuming that they are willing to play in a game that is whatever style the GM wants, are there any narrative styles or themes that are just as compelling as a Hero's Journey (while still having or leading to an end goal)? Or, more simply, are there other narrative styles that aren't the Hero's Journey?  


EDIT: What can i do to create overarching and long term story elements that don't involve a BBEG and some world ending event? Assuming that character development is at the forefront and that it would be a long running game, how would I create a story (or create plot hooks) that don't rely on the ""save the world"" trope, but I'm not sure how to do it while still having some kind of final goal. I want to know if there are other narrative structures, that don't have the world being taken over or destroyed, while still having some kind of finality at the end. (I hope this makes sense).  
Also, I believe that I may need to talk to the players about what kind of game I would like to run. It seems at the moment that the players may think the game is like a video game, that they are playing through scripted action, while I'm expecting the players to do whatever they want.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a4jh23/narrative_structures_and_themes_other_than_the/,"['Funny that you should bring up Coriolis. I\'m not sure why you say that owning a ship is the primary goal. The idea rather seems to be adding a layer of conflicted priorities to the main story (*""give them a ship that they have to downpay over the course of their core story""*).\n\nAnyways, especially in games like Coriolis – with a lot of hidden layers – I can see other goals than getting rich and killing people (even though both can happen in parallel to the other stuff): \n\n* **knowledge and understanding**. What are the Emissaries? What are the Mystics? What\'s going on with Horizons One and Two? What\'s my (every player\'s) point of view in this mess?\n* **building and preserving a community**. Maybe the PCs want to help a group of have-nots or refugees to find a place to stay, build it up into a real community ... or even a power to be reckoned with?\n* Plain **survival**. There is so much going on, so many enemies, so much intrigue, so much space to discover that even making it through is an achievement.\n\nComing back to your initial question about the **Hero\'s Journey** ... I don\'t think most RPG adventures follow the classic hero\'s journey. That pattern is used to tell a coming of age story: a young bright eyed hero sets off into the world, meets mentor, helpers, antagonist, is challenged, overcomes challenge, is transformed by it, and returns home where the world returns to normal. This returning to normal makes for a cyclical potential in storytelling, as you can start a new journey from there.\n\nWhat I see often in RPG campaign storytelling is what\'s called **Freytag\'s Pyramid** ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure#Freytag\'s_analysis)). It is similar in that it has ""overcoming an obstacle"" as a central set piece, but the end of the storyline does not necessarily lead to the same status quo we had before.\n\nWhich means that the hero\'s journey might be a great structure for episodical storytelling (Star Wars, A-Team, James Bond ... even though the latter two don\'t feature a bright eyed, naive hero), but there are other structures that up the ante over time (MCU, Battlestar Galactica). \n\nDoesn\'t mean that one is better than the other. Anyways, these are both linear ways of telling a story, which is the most comfortable structure to people with a modern western sensibility. But if you look at other storytelling traditions, you might find very different, albeit for us confusing, structures. Have a look here for examples: [Beyond the Hero\'s Journey](http://www.steveseager.com/heros-journey-four-innovative-narrative-models-digital-story-design/). Especially the Indian one (Bollywood!) mentioned there could be interesting for RPGs.\n\nJust quickly my conclusion: I think you shouldn\'t focus so much on the story structure but rather on the character development. The interesting part in stories are the characters, what they experience, how they react, what they learn, *how they change*! Stories should always about people ...\n\nSo ... sorry for the long rant, I hope this doesn\'t come over as overly academic ... because I don\'t have a clue, all of the above is just my interpretation and could be completely off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;', ""Be aware that what you describe as a typical RPG plot structure is NOT the Hero's Journey. HJ is not only about facing and overcoming dangers - the character's emotional evolution is as important. The hero that returns home is not the person who left it, just more powerful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's, in general, something that all engaging narrative structures have in common. Not only the character changes the world, the world also changes the character - and without growing up in terms of emotions, beliefs and relations they can't be successful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are alternatives to the Hero's Journey, like, for example, the [Heroine's Journey](https://www.maureenmurdock.com/articles/articles-the-heroines-journey/). But it's definitely not the kind of story you are looking for."", 'I tend to focus on character choice/development as the basis for my conflict, because it lets the players tell me what they\'re interested in.  For example, in the D&amp;D game I\'m preparing to run, one player told me that her noble-born character wants to take over leadership of her family and advance their fortunes as high as possible, Game of Thrones-style.  So then I knew to prep some political drama/scheming stuff, and that I can set up conflicts where I put that character into situations where she must decide how far she\'ll go to achieve her goals.    (Side note, I like how D&amp;D 5e helps GMs get to this area of conflict, by having PCs choose an Ideal and a Bond).  \n\nNarratively, I don\'t find the hero\'s journey very useful (as others have said, what you\'ve described isn\'t really the hero\'s journey, anyways); to me, it focuses a bit too much on the central hero, whereas the typical RPG party has a more-or-less equally shared spotlight.  So instead, I tend to rely on the traditional ""Exposition-Complicating Incident-Rising Action-Climax-Denouement"" format, with a larger (or, usually, several larger) story arcs tying everything together.  To put it another way, I tend to think in terms of TV series (episodic, but with season-long story arcs), rather than movies (single story arc).', ""I've played a few games that could be characterized as Kafkian, meaning that the world and characters get progressively worse and weirder with passing of time, in the end losing their humanity and inventory. If played correctly these too can be fun, but they require a special breed of gamers."", 'D&amp;D (and therefore by extension a lot of other games that use the same mechanical ideas) is based on picaresque and pulp narratives. Running ""traditional"" RPGs as written results in the same kinds of stories, any additional monomyth structure is on the GM. \n\nI\'m not sure there actually are any RPGs that follow the hero\'s journey on a mechanical level? That might be interesting to see. ', 'I\'ve done one long campaign and a few shorter adventures.  My players wanted to pretty much only smash and grab, which I was only moderately interested in as a DM.  \n\nWhat kept me going and interested was putting in a larger story that was more for myself than anyone else.  My players were familiar with Wow, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings, but not much else, so I dropped in a narrative hook that played out over months.  \n\nWhile they were camping one night in a barn, one of the zombies they had recently killed nearby rose up and started saying the strangest rhyme:\n\n""The lions sing, the hills take flight\n\nThe moon by day, the sun by night\n\nBlind woman, deaf man, jackdaw fool.\n\nLet the Lord of Chaos rule.""\n\nNow, you may (or not) recognize that from Robert Jordan\'s famous *Wheel of Time* series.  My players didn\'t, but that let me put in little hints and foreshadowings  that played out over the next several months.  The singing lions were bells pealing in a city to give a signal to attack.  The hills that flew were hills that got blown up with an antigravity mineral in them, and so on.  Anyway, it was really fun for me when the players finally realized they\'d accidentally released a chaos god into the world.\n\nYou might also look at narrative structures in contemporary TV shows and see how you could adapt that. Walter White from Breaking Bad, Richard Hendricks from Silicon Valley, Jon Snow in GoT, Eleanor Shellstrop from The Good Place could all be the basis for interesting character arcs.', '**The picaresque**, some discussion:\n\n[http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2009/10/where-action-is-part-2-grognardia-jack.html](http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2009/10/where-action-is-part-2-grognardia-jack.html)\n\n[http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2008/10/picaro-and-story-of-d.html](http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2008/10/picaro-and-story-of-d.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n `-So this is what a D&amp;D party so often is: not a group of people necessarily destined to grow and change and bend to conform to Principles of Drama, but a group of people who demonstrate, with infinite variation, how you can get through life by enacting different styles of being week after week in different short stories.` ', 'There are a variety of episodes on narrative structure on Game Developers Conference youtube channel that might help with you question.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0JB7TSe49lg56u6qH8y_MQ', 'Dave Farland’s try/fail cycles might be worth looking into. I can’t find the exact blog post, but it was essentially that in a good SFF story, the protagonist goes through three (sometimes loose) try/fail cycles where they are trying to obtain a goal, but something gets in the way.\n\n“Save the cat,” a screenplay writing book has a “beat sheet” that you can look up online. (Google: save the cat beat sheet.)\n\n\nThe hero’s journey doesn’t have to be epic. It can be about buying a ship, a car, a house. Think of the goddess/gate guardians/belly of whale as metaphors.

rpg,t3_a4j6gs,"I GM’d for the first timeHello again. Last week i came asking for any advice you lot may have for a first time GM and i was overwhelmed with the amount of helpful advice i received. Thanks. 

Whaat will follow is some game details for those interested but the tldr is; The advice you all gave me was great, thanks loads. Our first session game play was fun and set the scene nicely, all in all i feel it went better than expected. 

Now the session went as thus:

I had chosen fantasy age as the system because its quite light and easy for anyone to get going with and seemed fun and fast. We built characters and i made sure to ask questions about their characters and make notes. Both players rolled upper class scholar as their backgrounds so it made it easy for them to know each other, they were in digs together at university. 

I let one player take the intelligence(music) focus instead of what you should get for scholar because they wanted to study music at uni, now they are a flamboyant gnome rogue being played like a bard. The other is an Ork who was the friend who kept having to diffuse the fight that his short loudmouth friend gets into. 

As for play we got a short bit in. I had names of some setting with rough notes on how the places were bit i let the players add details to fill in the gaps and took notes. I also made sure i made a list of names for people in the world and some character traits and such i could marry up to them as needed and had a ready supply of names for taverns, shops, street names and such just incase i need them. 

They started on their home island of Durdling where not a lot happens and were walking through the jungle to go for a picnic, being careful not to go near the pink flowers as they had decided they were not only the most beautiful flower but deadly toxic from 10ft. They ran into a man in the woods who attacked them, they killed him and searched his body. 

While searching his body a demon appeared. Turns our the chap they killed was working for the demon and now she needs a replacement. Two minions are better than one so now my players work for a the demon in his place. 

We smash cut to a few weeks later to a the players getting off a boat in the big city of Cumdivock looking for a place to stay to wait for their orders from saiid demon. They found a city guide to show them about and asked to go to a bar to het some grub. He took them to the Rumbling Flagon which is a poor quality Dundling theme pub.

DnD 5e - the current edition\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nA quick Primer for online RPG discussion. \n\nIn General, RPG\'s outside of DND fall into a 2-axis spectrum between the *Story Games and OSR-style Games* axis and the *Generic Rules and Setting Specific Rules* axis. People will argue semantics and definitions but those are the general ones.\n\nStory Games place emphasis on taking narrative control from the Game Master and dividing it between the players. these emulate Novel/TV story arcs. Games Like FATE, Apocalypse World and ""Powered by the Apocalypse (PBTA)"" Games in general are usually classified story games.\n\nOSR-style games attempt to focus on the old school feel of exploring a world created by the Game Master. There is generally a focus on verisimilitude (feeling real) and Player\'s getting better at playing over just character getting better. This is also characterized by an attempt to understand what worked from old game designs. Games like BX Essentials, Shadow of the Demon lord, Zweihander, and Stars without Number are generally considered OSR-style games.\n\nPeople argue the definitions of OSR and story game axis alot online. I\'m just giving you a little context. I can get more in depth but this is good for now.\n\nGeneric systems attempt to create rules which can be used in any setting. these tend to be really flexible but uninspiring. Games Like GURPS, FATE, Savage Worlds, Index Card RPG, and Genesys are considered Generic systems.\n\nSetting Specific Games attempt to fit their rules to the aesthetic or rules of a particular world with less regard for players adapting it to other settings. Games Like Night Witches, Dreams Askew, The One Ring, Pendragon, and the three Star Wars RPG\'s all fall along this axis.\n\nDnD 5e sits roughly near the middle of all of these axis and is a good jumping off point for newcomers.\n\nThere is another axis which can be considered is the crunch axis. Crunchy games require more math to accomplish things than low crunch games. Crunchy games tend to focus on simulation and verisimilitude. Low crunch games tend to focus on accessibility and ease of play. Crunchy games can sometimes be considered good for new players because the GM doesn\'t have to make as many decisions. Low crunch games can be considered good because they get out of the experienced players way and just let\'s them play. GURPS with all of it\'s subsystems is High Crunch, Fate accelerated is low crunch. DnD 5e is considered moderate to high crunch.\n\n--------------------------------------\nDo you have any other questions? I\'m happy to respond.', 'In addition to the fine suggestions already here, you may want to take a look at [Unpossible Journeys](https://unpossiblejourneys.com), a site I created to serve people in exactly your situation. It includes info about beginner-friendly games, links to lots of free quick-start rules, how to find players, what to focus on when you start playing, and so on.', ""For what it's worth, here's a free version of what I play, GURPS. It is a game system that allows you to play *any* type of character in any setting, you could play a caveman, Roman legionary, Harry Potter wizard, Star Wars Jedi, even in one party if the campaign allows it (most don't). There's a lot more to it than this free version, but this will let you see what it's about.\n\n[http://www.warehouse23.com/products/SJG31-0004](http://www.warehouse23.com/products/SJG31-0004)"", ""Historically a lot of people started roleplaying games with fantasy, but there are now tons of games on the market for various genres. So if you like fantasy you're well provided for in RPG,  but it's not the only game setting available to you.I would start with whatever kind of fiction appeals to you the most. You'd be amazed just how many TV shows, films &amp; books have their own RPG's (especially the geeky cult TV shows), and it's very easy to adapt existing games to the sort of thing you'd like to play. There are different main categories of roleplaying games and then you could sub divide them within that. So, you've got your computer games in a roleplaying style, you've got live action role-play (LARP'ing...see google images) where people dress as their characters and act it out as drama improvisation, perhaps having fights with fake soft weapons, you've got 'tabletop' RPG, where you play your character just with your voice and no physical acting - like a radio drama. Another variation on 'tabletop' (room roleplaying) is playing online. Tabletop roleplaying is a very broad church. The gaming groups discuss &amp; choose the fiction genres that they feel like playing (eg. horror, sci fi, action thriller, post Apocalypse, Superhero, western, historical etc.). One group might always stick with the same game world and another group might regularly chop &amp; change what they play, going between settings and published game systems. Games could be taking place anywhere: in student Union student clubs, around people's houses, in games shops, pub side-rooms, bookshops or online. A gaming group is often about half a dozen people, but it's very approximate, as it's possible to game with more or less than that and it can depend on the genre. For instance, if it's based off a well known TV show some have a larger cast of essential main characters and others only have a couple of main leads. The player's own personal characters are called Player Characters (PCs) and all of the rest are called non player characters (NPCs). So it's like having your own character in a computer game RPG or a murder mystery evening/weekend.  \n\nThere are various aspects to a tabletop RPG that are all fun that we'd all enjoy, but we've all got our preferences. Some people particularly enjoy the mechanics side of roleplaying, seeing how the statistics, dice rolls and rules all work. Some love battle tactics and strategising best of all. Some want to go more deeply onto their character development and character psychology. Some love drama improvisation. This is fine as it means we don't all want to play exactly the same character with exactly the same party role. In many successful games we're all bringing different things to the table in and out of character. As with computer games board games and other hobbies, you might find that the first games and group you play with are great and just what you're after, or it might not be quite your thing, but another game and group is a much better match for you. So don't write off the entire hobby if your first game isn't what you hoped for. They're as different as selecting films on Netflix. \n\nIn a tabletop game each person is responsible for one character that is their own. You can think of this as being like an actor playing a single part. They would usually create this character themselves for longer games, but sometimes they'd be given a pre-generated character for a one off quick game to save time. You try to play true to the character concept you've rolled up. Your character may not be as knowledgeable about something you are good at in real life, or vice versa. You can have situations where your character handles a situation differently to the way you would have. You come up with what your character looks like, what their plot role/job/type is, some back-history, how your character thinks and acts and what they're good &amp; bad at. For the purposes of game play this stuff is represented by numbers against skills to see if they'll find tasks easy or hard. Tasks have difficulty levels and dice are rolled to factor in chance and to make it more fun. The person running the show is called the dungeon master, storyteller or games master in different games(DM/GM/ST). They may be working with a pre-published story or one they've created themselves. The GM knows what the villains are up to and what mistakes they've made, but not how the heroes are going to investigate this. They let this story unfold gradually, presenting the players with situations and character to react to. The players are improvising according to what they think their characters would be likely to think, say and do. The GM describes external &amp; environmental factors such as having a bar room brawl break out or there being a terrible storm. The GM calls the shots when it comes to anything unclear that needs a decision. Also...some games are more complicated than others mechanically and two different groups may run the same game very differently!\n\n    ""]"

The city has traditionally been very reclusive and so people rarely leave. (It's so reclusive in fact that there is a conspiracy within the city that tells the citizens that there is no civilization outside the walls but that's another story.)

My problem though is that I can't think of a way (besides geographic location) that no one outside the city would have discovered it. It's set in a big mountain range but it just doesn't make any sense to me that no one would have stumbled across it. Maps from outside the city don't list it and no one knows about it.

The citizens have long believed the magic surrounding the city was protecting them and keeping something out, when one day, it fails and the paths clear.

Maybe people from X kingdom see the map and assume that odd old script and castle symbol on top of mountains represents the old dead fortress of the Thunder kings and not the Castle-City, so why would any one bother traveling in sparsely populated hinterlands to climb some mountains to see an ancient ruined fortress? Maybe changes in the language cause locals to think that the name of the city is actually something else, so if the city\'s name was City in the mountains, the small changes in language could mean people now read it as City or Mountains and assume the title refers to the numerous mountains clustered in that area.

Maps were always made for a specific purpose with specific information. \n\nWhile relatively accurate geographic maps are considered standard in RPGs, you can always throw your players a curveball by giving them a map that the local monastery made that shows the distribution of all of the different types hops used for brewing. There could be some useful landmarks on their like big rivers and mountain ranges, or certain cities, but maybe also the political borders aren\'t that precise (perhaps because the monks want to gain access to hops in the bordering kingdom and so draw the borders a bit wide at the section).

rpg,t3_a4dqte,"How to gamify ritual circles and other obscurities?Players have found a book concerned with demons, their summoning and binding, and powers.

To my thinking, at least some of these demons should be summonable through complex ritual magic diagrams, the sort of crazy looking alchemical symbol work you don't want to see on your basement floor in blood.

My question is how have you all gamified this or other odd things in your games? I don't feel like drawing a complex ritual summoning circle should be just narrative, but neither do I feel it should be abstracted to a skill check, or roll under stat type of paradigm.

The only thing I've heard about that approaches this problem is Dread and it's Jenga tower block pulling.

You roll a set number of times based on your terminus to represent key points of the ritual - for example lets say you make a summoning that takes 6 hours and you're stocked with some quite good candles and offerings, so you gets 6 rolls, one for each hourly step. Don't count for success here, unless we have a botch. Then add complications or chances for it to stop completely.\n\nAdd up the total of the 6 rolls and compare it to a target goal. Depending on how close or above you got, alter the result and/or give the player more or less control over details.

The ritual isn't complete until the players have safely pulled a total of 10 or 12 blocks; if the tower falls, the ritual must be restarted (or, if you're an evil person, collapsing the tower summons the demon in a hostile state). "", ""I'm not sure how to answer your question, but I really liked your headline."", 'Depends a lot on how you and your players enjoy games. If you\'re running a strict ""player skill does not matter, only character skill"" paradigm, the only option you really have to make a challenge like this more engaging is to build discrete choices into the ritual that affect the result.\n\nPersonally, as someone who tends to play more simulationist than abstract, I would actually aim for a combination puzzle/drawing/comprehension challenge of sorts. This kind of challenge is generally great fun, but can definitely go wrong if you have a huge difference between player and character ability in this area (especially if the player is much worse than the character, and even more so if it relates to sensitive issues like disabilities.)\n\nAssuming that doesn\'t pose a problem for your group, let\'s go into how I would run this:\n\nThe players are given a number of partial images and descriptions of the ritual circle (e.g. images of the specific iconography, descriptions of how they are located about the circle), and must attempt to draw the ritual circle themselves, as well as indicating whatever other ritual shenanigans is going on (the black incense candles must be spread at these points, the goat skull needs to be placed here, facing south-east...)\n\nA lot of the fear and engagement with this kind of ritual in the fiction is the obsession that you need to get all the details right, or else things might go horribly wrong. If the challenge can create that same feeling in your players, it can make the game a lot more immersive and engaging. If you want to double down on immersion, make some nice props so the players can visualise the entire scene. This also helps with the ""spoken detail"" problem, where adding more detail to a spoken description can drastically increase the time it takes to convey information.\n\nSo TL;DR, if a task can be reasonably simulated at the table, rather than abstracted, that usually creates a greater sense of engagement and immersion. But what counts as ""reasonable to simulate"" varies from table to table, based off player ability, location, time constraints, safety concerns, etc.', 'It\'s very simple to gamify.  \n\n\nSince it\'s the character doing it, not me, I should be able to use the character\'s skills.  \n\n\nSo - drawing the circle correctly by copying from a diagram in a text might be an dexterity/""art"" skill check.   Doing it from memory might be some sort of intelligence/""mystic knowledge"" check.        \nIn either case an intelligence (or wisdom)/""demon summoning magic skill"" (that the player characters might not have to start with...) check would be appropriate after making the drawing but before invoking it to check it\'s been done right.  \n\n\nWhat you \\*shouldn\'t\\* do is make the player draw it, because then getting it right becomes based on the player\'s skill, not the character\'s, and I certainly wouldn\'t want to have to make checks for a supposedly trained, dextrous character drawing intricate diagrams by doing it myself - and even less would I want to force a friend of mine who has motor control issues and shaky hands to have to draw it.  Neither should my artist friend\'s low dex, fumblefingered illiterate barbarian get the benefits of the artist\'s great artistic skill and ability to control pen or pencil.  \n\n\nSimply put, it\'s no more outrageous to make it a skill check of some sort than for any other part of the game to be skill checks.        \nDo you make your players pick out poisonous plants as part of a survival check, or \\*actually\\* pick a lock when their rogue is faced with a locked chest?   Why then should reproducing a magical diagram be a player skill test rather than a character skill test?  \n', ""I LOVE magic like this. So much of classic rpg magic (I'm thinking dungeons and dragons here) is so cut and dry. Even if the actual physics of magic isn't explained directly, the components, casting time, damage, etc. is explained, and for me and my players, prescribed structure, puzzles, and ritual really take the 'magic' out of magic. What you need, imho, is a kind of magic that players do not understand in the least. \n\nMy solution to this is often with books of magic that PC's can't understand and with NPC's who can. My favorite stop to pull out, for example, is the described NPC starting a fire, throw some powders into it, take out a chicken, and turn to the PC. They then ask if the PC knows any songs or nursery rhymes. The PC says they do. The NPC instructs the PC to sit with their back to the fire, and begin singing the song on repeat, no matter what. Even if they hear the NPC talking to the fire. Even if they hear voices from the fire talking back. Once the PC's agree, the NPC slaughters the chicken and begins.\n\nWhy does the PC need to sing? What was the chicken for? What were those voices from the fire saying? The answer is absolutely nothing. The only thing that matters in that the PC thinks it matters and doesn't know how it works. Later, if the PC attempts the same ritual to achieve a similar magical effect, maybe it even works. Maybe it doesn't.

Insert rules about guessing too low / too high having different effects, so player can prioritize their guesses, amount of guesses they get depending on character skill."", ""Narratively, I feel that the mechanical difficulty should vary over time. Initially it should be very easy to summon the demon and have it do what you want - the first taste is always free.  Later, it should be harder to summon. Or maybe do it the other way around, initially hard to summon, but with few consequences, in later sessions it's easier to summon but there's a price to be paid. Maybe the demon even shows up on its own, as a whisper in the character's ear offering help during a difficult encounter.\n\nIf you want a mini-game, you could hand the player a ruler, compass, protractor and a sheet of instructions, but /u/IdlePigeon's warnings apply - you have to know your players like geometry. A different sort of handout, one that emphasises the rule-bound nature of demonology, would be a form that needs to be filled out - in triplicate of course, or a contract. Maybe some of the contract is in latin, if your players ask what it says, say it's probably not important. If you can get a rubber stamp with a pentagram or such on it to notarise things, that'd be great too. Just be careful where you leave your props, we don't want a repeat of the satanic panic. Or for your players to summon actual demons, that would be bad too.\n\nWhat I think would be a good way to do the mechanics is not in the form of a test, but a trade-off, a decision the players have to make. Yes, you can dig up the thigh bone of a suicide and imbue it with hellfire, but you're going to lose 10 Con, which you can recover at a rate of 1 per sure disease spell per week. Or if the demon's shown up uninvited during combat your next attack hits automatically, but so does your enemies. Or you get the location of the damsel in distress, but nothing will grow in your footsteps. Cut down the [Net Libram of Random Magical Effects](http://www.traykon.com/pdf/The_Net_Libram_of_Random_Magical_Effects.pdf) and have the player roll d666, all sixes and they get sucked down to hell, all ones and an angel has noticed and the demon won't be bothering you anymore but you're in big trouble."", 'How does failing an individual step matter?\n\nDoes failing step A change the outcome differently than failing step E?\n\nIf you can create new outcomes for each step or combination of steps failures then you can make something worthwhile imo. Otherwise why not just do it narratively.\n\nYou can do a puzzle like system ala one of those wooden puzzles, or maybe create an AI for a simple-ish game like chess where they have to figure out what patterns you’re doing and work them to their advantage. But those also feel arbitrary and unrelated to your circle drawing.\n\nI’d recommend grabbing something like the frost papers which have a bunch of ouiji style parlor games and have some things that are vague enough that you can just see what the players do with them. Like “draw a circle of the third type” and maybe give additional clues to them to how you want it drawn and if they match it reasonably then give them that success. ', 'What is the goal? Should it be a tactical challenge? A creative exercise? A source of interesting hooks and complications that drive play?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know two approaches that work well for the third case.\n\nOne of them is the ritual move in Dungeon World and some other PbtA games. The player states a goal they want to achieve by the ritual. Then the GM gives a list of conditions that must be satisfied for it to work, like ""It must be performed on a mountaintop during a new moon night"" or ""You need to use ten drops of of innocent blood"" or ""That will require at least eight assistants that know abyssal language"". Then, the play focuses on PCs finding ways to satisfy these conditions so that the ritual may succeed.\n\nAnother approach is Fate\'s challenge. A series of rolls that need to succeed for the ritual to work. What makes it interesting is that each roll should be made with a different skill, forcing the players to be creative in setting the ritual up. Also, a single failed roll negates the ritual, but in Fate players have an option of succeeding with a cost when they are unlucky with the dice. Such costs may be unintended side effects of the ritual or additional complications that must be handled before it can continue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the second case, I suggest checking Chuubo\'s Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine (paging u/emmony, who is much more familiar with this game than me). It has specific mechanics for running rituals, focused on what the PCs do and how it affects them more than on achieving specific goals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the first case, I don\'t have a good example. But it sounds interesting and I\'d like to see it if somebody finds or creates such a system.', ""If you're shying away from dice rolls, make it more of a negotiation between the demon being summoned and the players. Presumably the are summoning it for a reason (ask it something, trap it, bind it to their service somehow, etc.). If they can stack up advantages on their side of the negotiation, it'll go smoothly. If they go in half-assed, it'll go poorly for them because the demon has a lot of bargaining power.\n\nSo for example, there are a number of Summoning Circumstances you can create to make the ritual work better:\n\n-They need to draw up a ritual circle (which takes time and effort, and requires forbidden knowledge, such as found in their book)\n\n-They need to know the demon's name\n\n-They need to know the demon's type/class/origin (is it a succubus? A pit-fiend? A famine demon? A gluttony demon?)\n\n-They need to perform the summoning in a place of power (church? graveyard? forest glade? ley-line convergence? Site of an ancient battle? Top of a mountain?)\n\n-They need to sacrifice something living. Animals provide a weak benefit, a litre of blood from a willing human subject gives a medium benefit, and a human sacrifice gives a great benefit.\n\nSo that's 7 Summoning Circumstances.\n\nThe demon on the other hand will have the following Harmful Options, once summoned:\n\n-It is allowed to attack the players for the duration of its visit to this plane\n\n-It can wilfully lie to the players\n\n-It can glean their true names (which leaves them vulnerable to being summoned themselves or to being cursed - which is particularly problematic if it passes your names on to other demons)\n\n-It can psychologically torment them with horrifying visions, tantalising truths and their greatest fears\n\n-It can slightly misinterpret whatever they ask of it (they'll still accomplish whatever you asked, but will do so in a way that complicates things negatively)\n\n-The duration of the task/binding set will be less than expected, up to the GM's discretion.\n\n-It is able to curse the players and impose a negative effect on the players for a few days/weeks (blindness, insomnia, bad luck, impotence, sickness, forgetfulness, etc.)\n\nSo that's 7 Harmful Options.\n\nFor every one of the 7 Summoning Circumstances your players are able to achieve, they can remove one of the demon's Harmful Options. Next, the players and demon must bargain for whatever it is they want it to do. The demon is bound to obey - although if only 2 Summoning Circumstances have been met the demon can decide not to bargain and return to hell, but also forgoes all Harmful Options. The demon can ask for certain limitations to be placed on whatever is asked of it, in exchange for a further reduction in harmful options. For example, if the demon has 4 Harmful Options left, and the players demand that it serve them for a year, it could offer to relinquish 2 of its Harmful Options in exchange for reducing that term to a single month. Or perhaps it could relinquish 1 Harmful Options to bargain for every Sunday off for that year (on the proviso that it not spend those Sundays doing anything to harm the player). Harmful Options can also be traded for one another - part of the negotiations can include the player giving the Demon back Harmful Options it has denied it in exchange for further favours/removal of other Harmful Options.\n\nOnce the bargain is agreed by both parties then the Demon is able to exercise its remaining Harmful Options as it wishes, but must also obey whatever commands the players have given it.\n\nIf the demon being summoned is extremely powerful, the GM should add more Harmful Options (or negate Summoning Circumstances) to represent the fact that even if they have done the ritual perfectly, there are consequences to summoning a major demon and they are simply too powerful to contain safely.\n\nFurthermore the GM should also add more Harmful Options (or negate Summoning Circumstances) if the players ask too much of the demon. The easier the task set, the less Harmful Options they should have, the more difficult or elongated the task is, the greater the chance that they will be able to wriggle free from their binding and harm the players.\n\nWith these limitations in place your players can't just rely on demons to solve all their problems for them. I'd also encourage you to make the Harmful Options as vague as possible so the players don't know exactly what form the bad times will take.\n\nThe 7 Harmful Options and Summoning Circumstances above are just examples I whipped up - you should definitely tweak/add to them as befits whatever setting/campaign you're running.\n"", 'PCs attempting a major summoning shouldn\'t succeed or fail on just one roll, agreed. But it\'s also something so completely outside of most of the players\' knowledge and experience that trying to pin the characters\' success on players\' actions also seems problematic.\n\nHonestly, I have trouble conceptualizing how you could make gamifying the summoning a fair translation. From what I understand about this sort of thing, the training and study to build up a workable knowledge base on the subject requires quite a lot of study. Unless your gaming group consists of university grad students, there\'s no way that they\'ll have any kind of equivalent. \n\nAbout the only productive suggestion I can make is to borrow a few ideas from ""GURPS: Cabal"", in which success or failure on any given magical attempting other than quick and dirty combat effects requires aligning as many of the ""conditional modifiers"" as possible. In a nutshell, the Cabal is the pre-eminent magical conspiracy on Earth because they have access to the biggest libraries of the most precise records of all such, and each of their members study nore and more of the possible factors as they build their reputations within the Cabal.\n\nSo, for your players, you could ""gamify"" the summoning by letting the players come up with as many possible ways the characters could nudge the odds in their favor, and in as much detail as they like. But then the characters actually have to execute those factors to the best of their abilities. Essentially, let the players do your ""gamification"" work for you.\n\nPS: please be a bit more careful, and distinguish between ""players"" and ""characters"". The hobby has enough of a poor reputation as it is without reviving the Satanic Panic by means of a sentence like, ""my players found a book containing major demon summoning rituals"" getting overheard by the wrong whackado fundamentalist.

Determine how difficult you want the task to be for the **characters** if they have the *minimum* level of preparation. I.e. if in your world the requirements to summon a demon are its common name, a magical circle, and a sacrificial hamster; then what is the Difficulty Class/Target Number/Resolution Mechanic *du jour* with those, and only those, things prepared? This number should reflect a ""successful"" summoning (i.e. something shows up), not a safe one.\n2. Determine how difficult finding out these minimum steps are for the **players**. Does every peasant know how to accomplish it? Is it something only one specific cult in Istanbul still knows?\n3. Decide what\'s necessary to not only summon the being, but make it relatively ""safe"" to do so. This could take three different paths:\n    * The only difference is DC/TN/&amp;c. Maybe summoning is DC 25 but summoning &amp; controlling is DC 40. In this case come up with things the players can do to get bonuses to the check.\n    * The DC/TN/&amp;c. for ""safe"" summoning is the same as summoning at all, but requires some kind of additional special materials that makes a safe summoning difficult, e.g. a specific holy sword kept by the anti-demon church.\n    * A combination of the two.\n4. Determine how difficult it is to fulfill the extra requirements and how much of a bonus or penalty using jury-rigged components might entail.\n5. Miscellaneous extras that prevent demons from overrunning the world, as needed.\n\n\nAn example using Chronicles of Darkness style dicepools:\n\nTom is playing Roy Bann, a Pittsburgh occultist that needs a demon\'s help to pay off his student loans.\n\nStep 1: Summoning a demon at all is relatively difficult in modern day America, so even with everything ready a summoner still needs skill and luck: 15 successes need to be rolled before the demon materializes. It\'s also a long, easy to interrupt process, each roll takes an hour. Luckily for Tom/Roy, the roll is Resolve + Occult - Demon Rank, an Attribute and Skill combo he\'s invested in.\n\nStep 2: Summoning is a lost art, there are rumors a cult in Albany has a book on how to do it, but Tom will really need to put his imagination to the test to get it from them. The minimum requirements spelled out in the book are rather trivial to implement, if potentially pricey; a goat sacrifice, specific ritual chanting, a circle of silver and gold dust, and a name for a demon.\n\nStep 3: Keeping with the ""not easy"" theme, controlling the demon requires the name first used to summon it to our world. It also requires great willpower and resolve. After achieving the 15 successes to summon, Roy must spend a point of Willpower and roll Resolve + Occult vs Demon Rank each *minute* or the Demon breaks free. During the minute is when Roy can attempt to negotiate, if the negotiation succeeds the demon stops struggling. If the demon breaks free, it is free in our world for an amount of time equal to the initial summoning. Roy can banish the demon so long as Roy won the last contested roll.\n\nStep 4: Various things can make the summoning and/or binding easier:\n\n* Conducting the summoning in the language first used to summon the demon.\n* Having original or specially made replicas of artifacts symbolizing power over demons, or that demon\'s defeat.\n* Warding runes in the circle.\n\nStep 5: I actually partially rolled this into step three, if the demon breaks free it automatically gets banished after some number of hours, but, in addition, if bound to a task it must work towards that task, and only that task, until it succeeds, at which point it is banished.\n\n\nTadah, you now have an entire adventure around summoning this demon, and a high chance of fun™ occurring.']"
rpg,t3_a4dldk,"Learning how to sandbox campaign?Long story short: I'm a newbie DM with only a single test session under my belt to see if my friends would enjoy a tabletop RPG (specifically DnD5E, answer is yes) after which I started preparing for a full campaign for once we have the time to actually hold sessions as regularly as possible, and after a fair amount of preparation I realized that instead of the open-sandbox kind of thing I wanted to do, I ended up with a relatively linear story.

Rolling is pretty simple as the GM sets a target number and then the player has to roll a number of d6\'s equal to their skill rank of 1-6, a roll of a 4, 5, or 6 is a success and they enough successes as the TN or more.  Health isn\'t really tracked numerically, but rather is tracked via conditions that lower the number of dice you usually roll.  Conflicts are a bit more complicated, best way I can describe them is rock, paper, scissors beefed up.  Roll20 Will allow you to make your own cards for conflict though, this simplifies it as just play a card and then roll normally.  Story structure is pretty straightforward as well.  GM has a ""phase"" where they dictate how the PC\'s are progressing and throw challenges at them, then the PC\'s have a ""phase"" where they have the option of doing actions that are directed by them.  Also, the PCs are portrayed as small mice so the world is even more treacherous and the dangers tend to be adjusted accordingly.  So if they are caught in the rain, what might be a slight inconvenience for use, would result in a dangerous situation for them.  As they have to deal with cannon ball size water orbs bombarding them and possibly flooding in the area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRyuutama is another easy system to learn.  In this system the player stats are what type of dice they roll and for a check a GM determines the target number and what stats to use.  So if a character wanted to climb up a wall, the GM could say that it would require a strength + dexterity check with a TN of 6.  If a character had a strength of 4 and a dexterity of 8 they would then roll a d8 + d4 and try to beat 6.  This system is more about the ""journey"" though and the character archetypes aren\'t what you would typically find in a high adventure game. So less Conan the Barbarian and more Armand the Inn-keeper type of thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth systems have a very structured layout for GMs to follow for their sessions, and Ryuutama even has a section describing how you should plan your session and even provides some forms you can fill out to better organize it.  Mouse Guard is great for the ""fail forward"" mentality they try to stress for GMs to develop.  If a player character fails instead of saying ""nope doesn\'t work, think of something else"" you can just say ""You succeed but the attempt makes you angry"", angry being one of the aforementioned conditions.  You could also introduce a new twist, like the player succeeded in making the climb, but they alerted a snake nearby.

The main issue I find compared to IRL gaming is that there tends to be a bit less engagement all around; people seem to be more present and active in play when it's face-to-face. It's all too easy for players to get distracted doing other things during the session, and for the GM to get bogged down in the minutiae of what the platform has to offer rather than actually *running the game*.\n\nThe last bit is more a self-criticism than anything; Roll20 offers a lot of nifty tools for a GM, but they're something of a mixed blessing. You can keep track of all sorts of details with the character sheets and tokens, and automate a lot of rolls through macros, but this makes it easy to fall into the trap of trying to track *every last little thing* and slavishly adhere to every little rule as if it were a video game, whereas in meatspace gaming I find myself more likely to handwave the fiddly bits where they aren't relevant. You can put together very lovely and detailed battlemaps, but that easily gives way to a sense of obligation that you *need* to make highly detailed maps for every last scene. This leads to hours putting together sets for every possible location, and a hesitance to improvise when need be. (You absolutely can improvise every bit as easily as you can in meatspace gaming, but the contrast to more prepared scenes is more visibly obvious.) These issues for the GM are pretty heavily dependent on personal preferences and temperament, so they may not hold as much for every individual.\n\nI will say that although I have less experience with the platform as a player than as a GM, I have found it much more agreeable in that context. Maybe it's just that my personal tendencies as a GM aren't as good a fit for Roll20 as they are for meatspace."", 'I am currently using it for Harnmaster, DnD and Hero System.

rpg,t3_a4bzyn,"Need help with Lords of OlympusSo, I'm planning to run a game of Lords of Olympus for the first time. For those who don't know it, it's the Amber Diceless system, but with Greek gods.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really getting into it, but the more I read it, the more I'm starting to question how I am going to handle this. The power level is absolutely insane, so a whole bunch of lower level plot hooks just won't fly. Mortal NPCs don't even qualify as cannon fodder and whatnot.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is: given how powerful the PCs are, what could they be doing in various realms that will keep them busy? I'd rather not resort to tossing in other gods constantly just to give them an opponent. I'm leaning towards a plot involving Realms mysteriously disappearing. Turns out a new Primordial is born that is basically eating them all. Now the pressure is on to gather enough mythical artifacts and power to stand a chance. Fighting godly minions is fine and all, but what can I do if they're let's say looking to collect a mythical artifact from Wild West realm? Make it more interesting than ""grab it n destroy anything that tries to stop us""? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a4bzyn/need_help_with_lords_of_olympus/,"['That sounds awesome. Just a thought: maybe some of the existing gods try to side with the new primordial, and part of the plot is trying to figure out which god(s) they are.', 'You should take inspiration from actual Greek mythology, I think. Plenty of intrigue to be had. I once GMed a one shot based mostly on the Illiad.', 'Well. (Without knowing the system) I think there are ways to make mortal NPCs interesting. Not as a threat the players but in a „playball of the gods“ type of scenario.\n\nIn greek mythology, a classic example could be Heracles, bastard son of zeus and therefore hated by Zeus‘ wife, Hera; while Zeus is rather font of him. You could give them a likeable NPC another god has conflicting interests with. One side tries to protects them/give them blessings while the other side tries to harm them or supports their enemies.\n\nThe NPC (it could be a „Hero“, as fitting for greek mythology) might even take notice and actively attempt to gain favors of the gods by making offerings or performing heroic deeds on their name. On the other hand, they might actually be distressed when they feel the eyes of the gods on them, attempting to avoid them wherever possible.\n\nSomething that could work well for this I imagine is to make the players actually care for our „hero“. How that can be done depends on your group, but in generall they need to have character or at least some type of interesting quest. For example, give them an odysseus-like character attempting a task but constantly being let astray by gods hostile towards him, with the players helping him out of whatever mess he got in. This could also be done as a continuing „side quest“ popping up here and then as a break from the main fate-of-the-world-deciding buisness.\n\nWhy not just hit the other gods in the face and tell them to take their fingers of the hero? Well, I‘d assume the other Olympians wouldn‘t take to kindly to one of them starting a fight over something as trivial as a mortal - a certian etiquette is likely expected among gods. So a bit more subtly and indirect fighting should be applied.\n\nOn the other hand, mortals can also figure into the main story. Age of Mythology did this by having the gates of Tartarus only being able to be opened by the hands of a mortal - The god wanting them open (to set the Titans free) thus has to rely on a proxy to make it work. „Gods can‘t touch the McGuffin“ might sound lame, but on the other hand there is some tension to be had by limiting their all encompassing power in some way.', ""Wars can keep gods busy. \nBy example large armies of invasion have to be stopped, it will require more than one god.

Description:

***Undermountain: The Caverns of the Many-Legged*** is an adventure detailing a hidden mini-level for *Dungeon of the Mad Mage* for characters of levels 12-13. It uses some of the story and lore of that book, but it can be incorporated or dropped into any setting or homebrew campaign.

In a hidden part of Undermountain, former slaves feed their fat, monstrous queen who is fixated on revenge. A broken drow house has finally found a place to call home – only to become abominations. And a massive beast slithers, hunting for anything to satiate its hunger and quell its madness. Welcome to the Caverns of the Many-Legged. Which side, if any, will adventurers choose as they explore this hidden mini-level for *Dungeon of the Mad Mage*?

In this adventure, you will find:

* a mini-level that can be easily incorporated into *Dungeon of the Mad Mage*
* a vivid cast of unique monsters and NPCs, including chitine warriors, a choldrith queen, a spellcasting draegloth, a mad yuan-ti anathema, and others (stat blocks provided for all creatures not in the *Monster Manual*)
* locations that could be used or adapted elsewhere, such as a chitine colony and a drider-controlled drow fortress
* a combination of roleplay, exploration, and combat encounters",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a4buic/selfpromotion_my_dd_5e_adventure_undermountain/,"['Nice, thanks for sharing.']"

Just in your description mention you run a theatre-of-the-mind game. \n\nA VTT does offer more than just being a tabletop. While dicerolling is a kind of expected feature the greatest benefit I find are the character sheets.

rpg,t3_a4ankx,"Would appreciate some recommendations from you avid RPers!Hey all, I just wrapped up the fifth season of the Blacklist(Highly recommend!!), it's a show I stumbled upon while on a Netflix binge and I've fallen in love with it.   
I've only ever played D&amp;D 3.5-5e and a couple one shots of games like 7th Sea and Call of Cthulhu.  
For those of you who have seen the Blacklist, I think you know why I'm here. I've never played any modern setting rpgs, so I don't really know where to start here. \*\*I apologize if this post is kind of a mess, it's 6 am in my defense :p\*\* I'd really appreciate any recommendations for a ttrpg that can emulate the Blacklist.

rpg,t3_a4a4zl,"Iron Age D&amp;D - Loosely Celtic-based - Looking for ideas.Hi!

New here, so I hope I'm posting it in the right place. If not, I apologize beforehand - I tried looking for the rules of this forum, and found nothing against such questions. And please point me to the appropriate location/s?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm running an Iron-Age campaign (with D&amp;D5th), and as discussion here showed in the past -D&amp;D is mainly a pseudo-medieval game. So I'm looking for ideas. Seed. Maybe even adventures I can adapt.

&amp;#x200B;

Campaign axioms:

\- No earlier cultures. No ruins, no classic dungeons.

\- Iron age:

\--- No advanced technologies.

\--- Culture is primitive. No kingdoms, no large cities.

\--- No arcane magic. So, no wizard towers, as well.

\- No gods. No religion. That is - no temples, no priests, no paladins.

&amp;#x200B;

The campaign is located in an imaginary pre-roman-invasion Britain. Characters are mainly elves. Maybe some gnomes in the future. The baddies should be mainly Dark Dwarves (duergar), and star-gate-like Wraiths (mortal, humanoid).  The duergar are more organized, the wraiths are mainly hunters and raiders. Humans will join the campaign much later, with more advanced technology.

Also, there are Genus Loci - spirits of places. Rivers, Mountains, lakes, and even for villages and towns.

Magic belongs to druids (always male), and bards/skaalds (always female). Healing is the domain of the bards, mainly.

&amp;#x200B;

So, looking for ideas. First adventure was a simple zombies-in-the-graveyard, and the next one will be an adaptation of the old TSR module of *Rahasia*. But I want the characters to level up a bit before I throw them to the underdark to fight the duerger.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!

rpg,t3_a49b4v,"Conflict of Interest with the GM At the last session I fell into conflict with our Game Master.  We play in the author's system, and the plot of the campaign is in knights' climates with a great deal of heroism, basically, players' characters have not been harmed without permission until now. 

   
In my case, my character, which we will call XYZ for now, was caught by an antagonist and tortured. However, the main problem is that it is not because of my own mistakes, but simply a scenario. Because of these tortures, the beauty of my character, which could be determined by level 8, fell to 1,  I explained to our Game Master that I do not like something like that without my consent. Especially that the unwritten principle was that we do not destroy the characters so much. Unfortunately, he said that this is his vision of the story and at most he will agree to raise some of this beauty and that's really it. I admit, I felt like my opinion was ignored. And it became the main fuel of my butthurt. To be honest, the whole situation sucked my joy of thinking about this RPG, and instead the only thing I feel is irritation and discomfort as soon as I try to visualize the scenes with my character. 

Because of this situation, I have often had discussions with GM, after which I often went out unsatisfied, which resulted in more and more. I just want to ask a question, am I an immature player who can not cope with the attack on his character? For a moment I thought about changing the GM, but honestly I do not want to do it, out of respect for the co-players.

First step was to define the different types of situations your PCs would be trying to Overcome:

You are trying to overcome active or passive opposition in one of the following ways:

**Attack/Defend** You are either attacking, or being attacked

**Complication  Aspect** An aspect is currently preventing you from doing something

**Aspect Defense**  An active/passive opposition is attempting to prevent
you from  creating/using an existing Positive Aspect

Also, Boosts didn't translate well in PBP forums. So we threw that away and used NAPO which could either increase/decrease the opposition for the next action for that character.

Now Outcomes for the Overcome action looks like this:

__________________________________________________________________
#Failure
 
##Attack/Defend

**Attack** You couldn’t overcome the active/passive defense

**Defend** You are dealt damage
	
##Complication  Aspect

The attempt to overcome the complication can do nothing, deal damage, or add a new complication aspect to the scene (Up to GM).

##Aspect Defense

The aspect has become a Complication aspect and now the free invocation can be used against you or your allies to add passive opposition

#Tie

##Attack/Defend 

**Attack** Your next action has -1 to its active/passive opposition(-1NAPO)

**Defend** Your next action has +1 to its active/passive opposition(1NAPO)	

#Success

##Attack/Defend

**Attack** You deal damage, Style: Reduce damage to gain -1 NAPO

**Defend** Avoid the attack Style: -1 NAPO	

##Complication  Aspect

Your overcome attempt succeeds Style: -1NAPO

##Aspect Defense

You overcome the opposition preventing you from using/creating an aspect

Free invocation Style: 2 free invokes

rpg,t3_a454kw,"Trying to design a secret baseHi. I'm preparing my first one shot set in a 60s spy over-the-top setting in which the PCs are secret agents who must infiltrate the base of a terrorist organization that plans on launching a missile to somewhere - could be the White House, the United Nations headquarters, or even Santa's house, doesn't matter. (I was also thinking of giving bonus missions, like maybe *Retrieve the briefcase* and *Find our missing agent, be him dead or alive*)

I'm currently drawing a map and I couldn't find any advice as to what a secret base should have. As far as I know, there is the giant missile silo in which the rocket standing waiting to be launched, the control room from which the launching is supervised, a prison in which the fellow agent is detained and waiting to be rescued, and a underground dock from which the PCs manage to sneak into the base. I was also thinking of making it a circular base, with the missile silo at the center and the other rooms split around it. **But apart from that, what other types of room should there be, and how should I preferably arrange them on the map, by evil organization standards?**

The setting was inspired by the maps of Team Fortress 2, so it really doesn't need to be 100% realistic, but I still want it to feel believable as a secret base. I also don't want to design my base like a dungeon in which you enter room after room to get to the final boss. I'm using Fate, so I want to give the players freedom in how they operate to prevent the launching, whether they want to be sneaky or shoot their way through armies of goons. Lastly, note it's a one shot session that's not meant to last more than four hours, so I'd rather avoid making my base too large and have to many rooms ; instead, I'm trying to keep it compact.

rpg,t3_a44k1w,"Another Werewolf: The Apocalypse 20th ed questionSo the Get of Fenris gift Lightning Reflexes says the following:

*Lightning Reflexes (Level One) — Fenrir are Gaia’s ultimate warriors, effortlessly switching from offense to defense as the needs of battle demand. A mongoose-spirit teaches this Gift.* 

*System: The player reflexively spends one Willpower point. For the next day, the character need neither make a Willpower roll nor spend a Willpower point to abort to a defensive action.*

&amp;#x200B;

This looks nice, and is in line with previous editions of White Wolf games. Usually in an action scene you declare your actions from slowest to faster character, then resolve fastest to slowest. If you want to change what you're doing when you have to resolve your action, you need to spend Willpower and make a roll to do so. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, later on in the book, in the combat section, we get this:

*Changing an Action*

*Once you declare an action, that action is usually set. However, under drastic c circumstances (a grenade tossed at a character’s feet, a packmate in mortal danger, etc.), you may change your character’s declared activity. In such cases, add one to the difficulty of that new task, as your character reacts to meet the new challenge.*

&amp;#x200B;

This is much easier and takes less resources from the player. I always thought requiring a Willpower roll and spending a point was a bit much, but this seems almost too easy. The bigger problem is having two wildly different rules for the same thing in the same book.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have any thoughts on this? I think a good middle ground would be to have it be spend a point of Willpower and have +1 difficulty.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a44k1w/another_werewolf_the_apocalypse_20th_ed_question/,"[""Regardless of edition and regardless of WoD game, I've personally never seen much if any of the switching an action midstream. I'm guessing it has to do with the willpower cost/roll stuff. Not really an answer, but I do feel this is nice thing that might make that an appealing course of action to take if/when things change in the middle of a combat."", ""Oh man I hadn't actually noticed this even when I was getting deep in on tearing apart the initiative section a while ago, but it's not just the Gift. The rules for a defense specifically are on 289 and it says you that you need to make a successful willpower roll *or* spend a point of willpower to switch to a dodge/block/parry when you've already declared another action (so it's not so heavy a penalty), and the rule *you're* citing is on 293 (I think? the illustrations cut off the page numbers in this section).\n\nI got horribly curious about this because, based on earlier Fun With Initiative Edge Cases I did, I figured out that 20th Anniversary is actually a weird marriage of Revised and some rules brought back from 2nd Edition in places and I wondered if this was why. I have other editions laying around because this is the life I live, so I went on safari:\n\n**Revised** mentions bailing to a defensive action on 205 and changing actions in general on 206. The defensive rules simply state that a character can choose to abandon a planned action for a defensive action. The action-changing rules are the +1 difficulty rule you've found in W20, but with an interesting caveat: There's no difficulty bump for switching to a defensive action. Unless I am missing something (totally possible, WoD rule organization: Not the best) it looks like in Revised you could freely jump to a defensive action whenever it seemed reasonable. **2nd Edition** actually seems to be the same, to my great surprise, looking at the dodge and changing action rules on 226 and 227, and **1st** wasn't even really worth looking at but seems to be the same as 2nd but 2nd spelled things out slightly more.\n\nThe thing is that Lightning Reflexes is also a totally new Gift (or at least nothing like it appears in any of the old cores or the revised Get tribebook) so that's another thing that indicates to me that the willpower action change rule is actually *new* to Werewolf unless I am totally off my marbles. I totally believed that you're right about the Willpower rule being old, though, so: I turned to **Vampire Revised** and there it is on 209: Roll Willpower diff 6 or spend 1 Willpower, and this applies to defenses too. This is also how it works in Mage Revised and Hunter, which are the only other WoD cores I have on hand to check.\n\nI think what's going on here is a *straight up combat system difference* between older WoD line cores that I just had never noticed before because it all blurs together when you look at it for too long. It turns out that prior to W20, Werewolf's action-change and defensive rules were *unique* and they tried to patch in the Willpower rule from the other lines because, well, everything's kind of based on Vampire isn't it? Then they added a Werewolf Gift to interact with the new rule, and forgot to hit it in both places where action changing is mentioned.\n\nI think it's just because Werewolf was always the most combat-focused line, and that's why it was different.""]"

He kind of blames his bad luck and now every character he makes has the tendencies to die horribly in short time. That he also blames on bad luck and our GM is starting to feel at fault for this all 

But I kinda notice how he is actively putting himself in harms way

Is there an explanation for his behavior or a solution?

Someone has this happen before in their group too?


EDIT: the system isn’t D&amp;D (so no revive magic... or is /rpg for DnD?) but the topic isn’t about a particular rpg System but about a rpg player 

EDIT: in case it’s important it’s Shadowrun 5th edition 

...

SOLUTION

After having fled the exploding and burning oil rig with a helicopter, silence laid itself on the group heavy like lead. No one spoke a word but until after his funeral which was held in his favorite pub with his favorite low quality whiskey. 

„To Caleb“ said the leader and the team repeated the chant before they downed the bitter drink. One Glas of whiskey remained untouched 

Until a mercenary (his new character) walked up and picked up the whiskey glas, drinking it all in one go and saying „it’s bad to waste whiskey“. Not to say we beat him up 

Said mercenary (Ajax) joined us on the next missions. He was reckless but always preferred to put himself in harms way. As selfless as he is, he did it for the extra money and recognition for he revealed to have a little sick sister and a brother he hasn’t seen in years

It was all fine until recently but history and revenge have a tendency to come back and bite - badly. The corporation send their newest prototype assassin to gut us - and the assassin kidnapped Ajax little sister from the sick bed to pull us into an ambush 

The ambush did bind us all in combat leaving only an injured Ajax to advance past the killing zone that was set up for us and save his sister - there he met Caleb (players former character we left for dead) but stuffed beyond hell and back with life supporting cyberware. They fought with Ajax pulling ahead by just by a hairs breath and saved his sister. Having the player deal the killing blow to his former character and brother he hasn’t seen in years

„What happened?“ we asked when Ajax returned to us

„Nothing... just coming to gripes... with myself“
(Not sure if in character or out of character but it feels like both at the same time)

Our suicidal player has been silent ever since like he is savoring the moment but he has a pained expression which slowly changed to relief. We didn’t say anything but gave out GM a friendly tap on the shoulder.

However, I don\'t think this is an issue with ""becoming too attached to characters."" To me, this looks like the player wants to play a different game than what you guys are playing.\n\nFrom what it sounds like, you guys are playing a fairly gritty Shadowrun game where actions have consequences. The system reinforces this, because death spirals due to injuries are common; you do *not* want to take a large hit in the game because your character will have so many penalties to act that they\'ll likely fail and die. However, the PC keeps running into dangerous situations where this sort of injury is likely. Why?\n\nI think it\'s because the player wants to play an action game where you can do cool things and be cool, and the game is actually geared towards a more realistic scenario where the person who is careful and thoughtful will survive to fight another day. And each cool action-hero character that dies by being thrown into the meat grinder is one more reinforcement of the fact that the player isn\'t playing the game they want to play. And this causes the disengagement/change in personality you\'re seeing.\n\nIf this is going to change, either the player needs to adjust their expectation of what the game is and how to play it, or the GM needs to make the game more cool-action-hero-oriented. In either case, the group will eventually need to talk about the sort of game and characters they want to play, because it\'s not working now.\n\nEDIT: Tied into this, if my hunch is correct, I would say that the GM also needs to engineer scenes where the PC can be a cool action hero. Not every game, necessarily, but I know that I get frustrated with a game if I keep failing rolls and not doing what I want to do--it effectively robs me of a chance to impact the story, and helping create a cool story is the main reason I play.

If you would join to [learn more helpful advice](https://teachable.us18.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=1ed5c0beec737868062396e9a&amp;id=77cfdff390) (and tell me what you want to learn about) I would be grateful. "", ""I think a good portion of this could be just humans being bad at probability. You see it in games like xcom all the time. It's a cycle. Something bad happens. We feel bad and luck now 'owes' us something. So we're more inclined to take high risk high reward actions to 'catch up'. If this fails rather than looking at the plan, we blame luck, and take even bigger risks. This spirals until we either spin out and rage quit, or do actually get a stroke of luck. Then we praise our tactics and learn nothing. \n\nNow I think of it, that's probably where gambling additictions come from. \n\nTabletop rpgs aren't crpgs though. Your DM should really be handling things of a player's not having fun. Try talk about it at the table, or failing that, have your character be the voice of reason."", 'Off topic: is shadowrun interesting to play? Can you tell me about it? ', ""The best thing you can do is just talk to the player, and get an idea of how they're actually feeling about it.\n\nI've seen and felt similar. Losing a long-term favourite character can be anoying if you've invested in them, and replacement characters just don't give the same appeal.\n\nSuggestion - let him bring the old guy back? Granted he's dead, but this is Shadowrun, where there is both magic and machine. His resurrection could be a mystery plot for the party to look into, and maybe they return with mysterious Cyberware they can't identify? It'll help in the short term anyway."", ""If it's Shadowrun 5e, then did the character that originally died and set this off have no edge left to burn? Because as long as they had at least one point left, they could have burned it to survive with some sort of penalty, even from things like a headshot or huge explosion. So it wouldn't be impossible to retcon the death and have the favorite show up again with some sort of damage.

Instead of pushing the player to jump into a new relationship he could play the field for a while. For me, sometimes the most fun after a beloved character dies is a series of short term relationships with no strings. Here\'s a non-disrupive approach:\n\nAsk the player to keep the new character\'s backstory very, very light. Ideally, it is DIRECTLY hooked into another PC\'s character - ""I was sent from Blastum\'s tribe to protect him on his quest. I will give my life for him!"" or hooked directly into the narrative. The character becomes a tool to help another player or the DM tell their story. This gives the player a perfect excuse to be reckless.\n\nSometimes the hapless redshirt is fun to play.

However, there are times when talking doesn't work, because it's not a communication issue or the player isn't aware of what they're doing and don't see a problem.  To the player they might think they are playing the same way and it really is just bad luck.  When that happens you need to observe them a bit, try to figure out what exactly changed and why.  What changed about things after the character died vs before they died?  Was his old character a major part of the party and now his new characters are more on the periphery?  Does he get a lot of attention when his character dies but is mostly ignored otherwise?  Did he talk about his first character with glee and now looks at the new ones with disinterest?  Has he actually always played his characters like this and he was just lucky before?  Once you can piece together the reason, you should be able to figure out a solution.  \n\nIn general, my advice would be to actively work his character into the group, make connections with them, ask for their input, and give them some responsibility that is going to naturally lead to interaction and attachment.  I'm not saying you aren't already doing that but be more aware of it and focus on it.  Also, try to take note of one thing his character does (that isn't suicidal) that you like and give him genuine and specific praise the next time there's a break in play during a session.  Essentially, the hope is by working him into the group you'll motivate him to do other things then just charge headlong into every situation because he'll care about others.

rpg,t3_a448g6,"[Self Promotion] Unpainted Bandit Miniatures 

I've just released my first four miniatures for a small miniature company I started. I love miniatures and I figure you can never have too many miniature alternatives. I'll be creating more miniatures as time goes on, but since I'm personally bankrolling this entire endeavor, I won't be able to pump out miniatures like the big guys do. I've kept the price as low as possible as this is currently a passion project and hobby for me rather than a means of generating income, of which I hope to break even from. Creating miniatures full time would be amazing, but I'm taking it one step at a time!

My first four miniatures are a group of bandits tailored towards a realistic fantasy style setting. They are true 28mm scale (each approximately 1/64) and unpainted. Each miniature stands on a circular base, 1 inch in diameter. They are plastic, slightly flexible, and very durable.

I normally prefer low fantasy, gritty, more story based games...also appreciate elegant rules.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a43w3t/sell_me_or_dissuade_me_on_conan_2d20/,"[""I've got it (am a sucker for anything REH) and am pleased with the quality of the book.  My overall thoughts on the game itself, having run only a few hours of it:\n\n\n- It's *very* gamey.  Two metacurrencies and constant modular options.\n\n\n- Do you like feat trees?  Character gen is all feat trees.\n\n\n- It matches the pacing and swing of sword and sorcery better than any other RPG I've played with a three page character sheet.\n\n\nI'm happy with the purchase and I expect I'll throw a short campaign together for a weekend of gaming sometime in the new year.\n\n\n*That said...* if you're very much driven by the narrativist and boiled down elegance above any gamey aspect, I cannot recommend **Swords without Master** highly enough — 2d6 where outcome is tone and not success, from the mind that brought you **Dread**"", 'Elegant rules is certainly not Conan 2d20’s strong point. The core rulebook requires some portions to be read and re-read several times to understand what the system is trying to accomplish. Google+ and Modiphius forums are good for help, as Jason Durall and the game designers post there regularly. Keith Johnson at Starships and Steel blog has a series of YouTube videos that help explain a lot of the mechanics and rules. Overall the game works fine, but there are some points to consider:\n\nCharacters are heroic. They are going to cut through oodles of cannon fodder, and in a group of 4+, might even overwhelm the main baddie quickly. One to three players seems to be the sweet spot for Conan 2d20. You may have to up the number of minions and add some tougher baddies to compensate if you have a larger group of players. Not hard to do. Conan does combat fairly well by letting the GM cluster low-end baddies into squads.\n\nDoom is NOT intended to be adversarial in relation to the players. I have seen this complaint a lot. The intent is to spice up the scene or adventure. Use Doom to add some reinforcements for the bad guys. Again, the players are well above average in this game - it is designed to mimic Conan’s adventures. Let them be big, but use Doom to keep things interesting. Not competitive. Use it to help tell the story. Spend Doom to make a wall collapse, cutting of the PCs from friendly NPCS; now they have to find another way to link back to the NPCs. It does not have to inflict damage to be useful - but rather make it interesting.\n\nConan 2d20 also utilizes Fear and horror, in the form of Displays. Maybe a player cuts off the head of a foe and displays it in battle for the remaining enemies to see, which might cause them to flee or freeze in shock. Enemies can do the same (another way to spend Doom!) to the players. Consult the Cthulhu setting for inspiration here. Rather than trolls, ogres, dragons, players in Conan are dealing with some dark, scary shit here. It definitely makes the game refreshing.\n\nNot all the supplements/sourcebooks are released yet. The corebook, Book of Skelos (magic system), Mercenary, Pirate, Thief, Barbarian and others are. You do not need all these to play, but each delves into the Hyborian Age and the setting (Thief focuses on Zamora and nearby places, Mercenary is Shem, Khoraja). If you are a Conan fan, the game is pretty good. Magic is cumbersome and does not equate to what D&amp;D and typical fantasy systems do at all. Magic is mysterious, shunned and frightening - although powerful once learned. It can (and will most likely) lead to death or destruction of the sorcerer itself. Again, if you like the Conan stories, the game does a good job at bringing that into a playable system.', ""I am not as familiar with the 2d20 system, but I know some of our local gamers have played it and they now tend to avoid the 2d20 system and don't seem to care for it much. Not sure if I would be that opposed to it, what I read of it sounded cool. I'm not going to dissuade you of anything because Conan (Hyborean setting) is absolutely badass so you really can't go wrong. Here are some other Conan-styled games I've either player or are coming out soon:\n\nIron Heroes d20 (basically low-fantasy brutal D&amp;D 3rd edition with better rules)\n\nSavage Worlds Setting: Beasts &amp; Barbarians\n\nPrimeval Thule (The Continent of Thule, think savage dinosaurs and sorceror kings and elder gods, its a setting for a variety of systems, could easily be dropped into the Conan universe and is in fact mentioned in some of HP Lovecraft and Howard's fiction)\n\nSwords of the Serpentine (coming out soon from Pelgrane Press)"", ""It's a good game, if you like rules and a game centric design.  \n\nIf you want story first narrative play it is NOT the game for you. It does Conan very well, but it's definitely a game.  \n\nIf you want low fantasy and story based, I would look at Barbarians of Lemuria, Sharp Swords and Sinister Spells, or the slightly less crunchy than D&amp;D Low Fantasy Gaming (which is both amazing and free).    \n\nI would suggest [Low Fantasy Gaming](https://lowfantasygaming.com/), it leaves a lot of narrative space, doesn't have piles of skills, magic is both scary and unpredictable, and monsters are terrifying.

rpg,t3_a43ibo,"The Colville Screw &amp; abandoning the promise of balanced encounters in 5e?This post is inspired by the following post on /r/mattcolville:

https://www.reddit.com/r/mattcolville/comments/a3pfqb/best_session_ive_ever_had_as_a_dm_thanks_to_some/

...It stems from an observation Matt Colville had about how he'd often create encounters or sessions having no idea how his PCs would survive - but they would almost always would, somehow. This feels analogous to the OSR inclination to create scenarios bereft of balance. D&amp;D 5e cares a lot about balance, at least it tries to (see the mess that is CR ratings) but maybe it's more amenable to unbalanced sessions/adventures than the designers realized. Is balance important to your 5e games? Why or why not? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a43ibo/the_colville_screw_abandoning_the_promise_of/,"['I\'ve found that CR is pretty unreliable at both ends of the spectrum. Even ""easy"" encounters at level 1 can quickly end in a TPK due to the randomness of D20s, low stat modifiers, low hp levels, and the limited toolkits/resources most classes have. But at higher levels, players get *so* much stronger *so* much faster than the monsters (especially if they get ahold of some magic items), that even encounters two or three times over the ""deadly"" threshhold will have characters barely breaking a sweat.\n\nReal story: I once refitted the top floor of the Forge of Fury to make it feel more like an actual orc clan lived there. I busted out volo\'s guide and put in a *shit ton* of orcs. My players didn\'t bother exploring around for any of the alternate entrances, and decided to just storm the front gate. The alarm went off, which of course alerted the entire place... *three level 5 players then proceeded to murder their way through 30,000 adjusted exp worth of orcs* over two mega-encounters, with only a short rest in between. For the record, the ""Deadly"" threshhold for three level 5 players is *3,300.* That\'s how useless CR is. \n\nSo my approach these days is to just populate areas with the stuff that would actually live there. A rust monster nest doesn\'t contain 5 rust monsters, it contains 50 of them. How will the players get past 50 rust monsters? I don\'t know, that\'s their job, not mine. \nHowever, if you take this approach, *be sure to talk it over with your players first.* Lots of D&amp;D players come into a game expecting to win every fight by default, so it\'s very important to make sure they\'re okay with the idea that not every challenge is designed to be traditionally ""beatable."" ', 'The easiest way to unshackle yourself from balanced encounters is to introduce a transparent Party Retreat rule, so players know they can escape (or have a good chance of such) if they get in over their heads. Possibly complimented with an improv chase system. Having this rule completely changes dnd, and older editions had such a rule. 5e does not and is worse for it.', ""I stopped designing like that a long time ago.\n\nIt's actually much easier to just create the world and think 'what's in it'  than worry about that matching the player's abilities as if you put enough in the world there's probably something they can work out a way to tackle.\n\nSo if I design a Kobold hideout I just work out how many live in a tribe and create their lair. If this number happens to be 150 and the players burst down the door then they're going to have a lot of Kobolds on their hand. \n\nIf it makes sense for a dragon lair to be next to the place the players start then maybe they stumble into a dragon lair.\n\nEverything is designed in a similar way.\n\nLikewise 5E characters especially are so insanely powerful that they can repeatedly curb stomp things far above the advised CR levels."", 'Balance and CR I think are good for new learning GMs.  They along with RAW are like training wheels to get a group going.  CR/Balance is great for Final Fantasy esque linear adventures.  A controlled experience that, let\'s face it, is on a railroad to some degree.  CR/Balance also tends to be way to conservative once the players gain a little mastery of game mechanics and start experimenting with non standard party comps.\n\nSo I just don\'t follow all that suggested CR and Balancing guidelines.  But I also design the campaigns around that.    Once you throw all that away, you will find that you cannot do Final Fantasy esque adventures anymore.  So a lot of GMs throw away the balance, throw off the fudging, but forget to adjust their campaigns to fit the style and it\'s just disastrous.  Whereas something like a Sandbox West Marches game is perfectly suited for a no forced balancing campaign.\n\nAs for what I like about throwing balance to the wind is it challenges both me as the GM and the players to come up with solutions.  It\'s my job to make sure that the situation is somehow winnable (whatever form that may take), and it\'s the players job to figure out not only how to win, but what is winning in the scenario.  The game becomes less predictable and after you\'ve been playing for 20 years, that\'s what the players and GM starts to seek out - new unpredictable experiences.\n\nBut also I think it\'s foolish to say there is no balancing involved.  I just don\'t follow the standard balancing guidelines.  A GM who just throws straight forward red dragon combats at their level 1 parties to be ""against the CR!"" is doing it wrong.  The balance just comes in other ways, primarily narrative balance and how the scene is staged and presented to the party.  The problem with those kinds of balances is you can\'t really teach someone how to do it through a book, they just have to learn by experience and failure.  Balancing with factors other than the maths is something unique to every group.\n\nTL;DR - after you are with the hobby for 5+ years, over-balanced games start to get a little boring.  And at the 20+ year mark, you just seek Chaos.', 'The problem with this is that you can\'t design encounters where you have ""no idea how/if the PCs would survive"" if you have no idea what an encounter that the PCs SHOULD survive will look like.  \n\nThese two things depend on each other.  \n\nThat said, reading the linked post, it doesn\'t even sound like this was the result of ""encounter design"";  the DM didn\'t set up that situation.  It happened, in no small part, because of the actions of the players.   If the DM had DESIGNED this encounter as a ""just ignore CR and throw all kinds of crap in there"" mess, it probably would\'ve exploded in his face.  Instead, you\'ve got a setup that basically DOES use CR, but didn\'t neatly segregate everything into tidy encounter blobs.  Or rather, it DID, but then the PCs summoned an elephant and the DM reacted appropriately. \n\nSo honestly, I don\'t feel like the story in question teaches us much about encounter design and CR at all.', 'The approach I take to Challenge Ratings and similar encounter balance mechanisms is that they allow me to make informed decisions as GM - I know what a balanced encounter should look like, so if I choose to make an unbalanced one, I can do so deliberately and intentionally, rather than by accident.', 'Something to consider about D&amp;D 5e:\n\nD&amp;D 5e has a pretty big cushion in terms of death. If someone get knocked to 0hp in a context where the environment isn\'t dangerous (on fire, underwater, covered in acid, etc.) then they have a 60% chance of stabilizing without medical attention. Additionally, there\'s about an 18% chance that they will roll a natural 20 and pop up with 1 hp instead of going unconscious. Additionally, unless you roll a natural 1 or take damage, it will take a minimum of 3 rounds before you bleed out, giving your allies time to finish the fight and get back to you. And, perhaps most significantly of all, the first-level, bonus action spell ""Healing Word"" will pop them up provided that the party has either a bard or a cleric that isn\'t out of spell slots; and if you have a 5th level cleric they can always cast Revivify if they\'re less than a minute late.\n\nWith all that in mind, the two main situations that are likely to kill a player are:\n\n* An enemy decides to kill a downed enemy, rather than fight back against enemies that are fighting back, or\n* It\'s a TPK scenario, the rest of the party either dies or is forced to a hasty retreat that abandons their friend\n\nThe first case happens primarily as a question of GM style, not GM skill. If the GM wants to kill their player, that\'s pretty easy in this situation; if they don\'t want to kill their player, then that\'s also pretty easy to avoid. There\'s nothing in the rules or spirit of the game that says you have to double-tap a PC if they\'re down.\n\nBut the second case? The second case happens when the balance is way, way off. A TPK scenario happens when the players are up against something they are unable to beat and either will not or cannot flee from. And a TPK is universally considered to be a Very Bad Thing. If you aren\'t explicitly trying to kill the PCs, the range of ""survivable"" battles is extremely wide. But you only have to be really wrong once, and they all die. Game over, new campaign. ', 'It depends on what kind of game you\'re trying to run. I like to run a game focused on challenging combat. I don\'t know if my adventures are *balanced*, but I\'ve learned about how to keep them *consistent*, so I know how to ramp up the difficulty to keep my adventures challenging without being overwhelming.\n\nOn the other hand, some OSR games are about how the world is *definitely* dangerous and is likely to kill you, and the challenge of those games is knowing how to *avoid* danger, so ""balanced encounters"" is not even a consideration.', 'Your character\'s Brains are their most potent weapon. I always create encounters that are just on the verge of deadly (using kobold club) and it always seems to work out. This is especially true if you treat combat like a narrative encounter and shape some of the combatants decisions to not be ""perfect"", strategy wise, especially on rolls of a 1. ', 'I never saw CR and the encounter building rules as inherently about creating balanced encounters. It simply gives you the tools to create encounters and then understand whether an encounter is of easy, medium, difficult, or deadly difficulty. You can create any type of encounter at any time.', 'I think I\'m fine with forgetting balance in 5e, if only because the turn to turn mechanics aren\'t that fun if you\'re really getting into challenged based ""players are trying to WIN encounters"" mindset. Building around Bonus Action Economy isn\'t fun. Generating Advantage mechanically isn\'t fun. Assessing the risk of exhaustion levels while playing a Berserker Barbarian isn\'t fun. Spending Meta Magic Points to give a target Disadvantage on a Saving Throw isn\'t fun. Recovering X spell slots on a short rest isn\'t fun.\n\nAnd that\'s not a knock against 5e as a system, which I\'ve been playing twice a week for like 2 and a half years at this point. I absolutely love Fantasy Flight\'s Star Wars games but still think a lot of the mechanics in it aren\'t really fun, like taking two Setback Die off in specific circumstances or taking a Strain so I can Aim Better. But really I\'m not trying to engage with mechanics in those games as much as I am with narration and whether or not a roll is just successful or whatever. I think a big reason I don\'t like Pathfinder is that I\'ve read it a whole hell of a lot more than I ever played it, and the myriad ways you can get +1 to different things isn\'t at all sexy mechanics. I know people have fun with Pathfinder, and maybe I\'d have more fun with it if I just... cared a lot less about the mechanics of the game. 5e really sang to me, especially as a GM, when I just stopped giving a fuck about mechanics and focused on getting my players into trouble and then help them find ways to get out later.\n\nNow, I also ran an absolute ton of 4e D&amp;d back in the day and occasionally run 13th Age today. That was a game that really needed balance and honing because marking and grid movement and how many rounds you can set a guy on fire and successfully moving all the enemies in a room together so your cleric can hit them with a big thunder blast and knock them all down actually was super fun. Roll dice like a hundred times, whatever, I want to see how a bunch of different actions iterate over time.', ""Now, don't get me wrong. I do like running 5e, and I do like playing it as well. Just, when you're thinking of encounters, don't do the easy thing. Don't base anything at all on things like challenge rating, suggested number of traps in a dungeon, whatever. Throw in what seems right, not what they tell you is right. \n\nI just ran a session with 3 PCs and 3 assisting NPCs, all level 1. They took down a mummy with only minor difficulty. Sure, on a good roll (let alone a crit) it could have one-shot any of them... but it only got 4 chances to even attack. But it was good, it was fun. There was a real sense of danger.\n\nSo, what I'm really saying is, OP is basically right. In 5e, throw your players in against threats that absolutely CAN demolish them. Don't necessarily be going out of your way to murder them, but always put them at a disadvantage right from the start. Because, as the rules of 5e teach us, that's the only way to cancel out the advantage they already have. "", ""I think it's better to work out how one or more PCs can actually die, in case your 'unbalanced' dungeons are actually kid gloving the players without you realising it. 'Unbalanced' can just as much fall into cakewalk territory (that's what unbalanced is) - just because you don't try to balance it doesn't mean it's going to definitely be dangerous somehow."", 'The combat math in 5e is as fragile as a piece of straw, the CR system isn\'t really designed to *create* balanced combat so much as it is a means to *prevent extreme imbalance.* 5e is designed in such a way that the vast majority of abilities are strictly numeric/linear, this tends to mean that any abilities that aren\'t numeric are extremely powerful. The CR system can\'t account for things like resurrection, summoning, or teleportation, so the players can use these abilities to win most if not all encounters that are even slightly reasonable.\n\nSo yes, disregarding balance in encounter design is certainly something that can be nice in 5e, but as with most things in RPGs your results will vary by your group. You have to be cautious with such a mentality: what if they don\'t have access to any of the quadratic abilities, how punishing is any given hit, do your players expect standardized encounters, etc.\n\nAnd no, disregarding balance during encounter design isn\'t really analogous to the OSR. The OSR doesn\'t really believe that encounters should be ""designed"" in *any* sense outside of simulation.', ""Isn't playing boring, once you know the DM has planned encounters that you should survive?\n\nIsn't a lot more fun to discover stuff that just exists in that specific world and just try to find out how hard is it?"", ""It's really not surprising that these situations tended to result in the characters surviving. I mean, the players are heavily motivated to survive and are probably doing everything in their control to survive the encounter and the GM also would prefer that the PCs survive in this case, and to the extent the GM has influence on what happens, Matt's likely to choose things that are plausible but will tend towards that outcome, on balance. In addition, he's said he's not above fudging a roll or two here and there to make sure the game experience is exciting and fun for everyone. So, yeah more often than not they find a way to survive."", 'Here\'s the thing I\'ve noticed about 5e as a veteran player, and DM, of 3.5 and Pathfinder for some 15 years. 5e is easy. Not just easy to get into, not just easy to play. It\'s easy. The rules, the classes and subclasses, the entire new TONE that 5e has that previous versions didn\'t. Every single little bit of it favors the player just that little extra bit that means, no matter what task they undertake, they are solidly more likely to succeed than to fail. \n\nTake the ""If it meets it, it beats it"" ruling. Applies equally to both sides, so it seems fair. Balanced. But the DM sees everything from overhead so to speak, and a lot of creative energy goes into running all of the pieces of the world. The player, on the other hand, sees the world head on, and they get to put every single bit of creativity they have into the one piece they control. That means that overall, player characters will be trying more things, taking more actions, putting together more unexpected solutions, than any singular creature under the DM will except for the stand-out villains the DM gets to play like a player. So, since the Players are the ones taking the most actions, and ""If it meets it, it beats it"" favors the active party over the passive party, the players take it more often than they don\'t. \n\nTake advantage/disadvantage. Because the DM is running the world, and the players are acting in it, no matter what the DM does (short of railroading) the players are the active party in every event. Even setting up an ambush for the players, because it is the players who decide where to go and what to do, and the DM organically has the things already happening in the world respond to the players actions (or inaction as the case may be), the DM is always reactive, the Players active. And anyone who knows anything about strategy, in games or in life, will tell you that the reactive party loses more often than it wins. Because is is the active party who most often sets the terms of an engagement. So with smart planning, or even just awareness of their circumstances, the players can put themselves in positions where they will have advantage over any but the absolute most hazardous and unexpected beings or conditions even when the encounter comes as a surprise to them. \n\nTake Death Saving throws. Three losses is death, three wins is life, all on a flat roll above or below half. Sounds perfectly balanced. But getting hit is only a lost roll, getting healed gets you up, and there are tons of restorative abilities. But that\'s fine, it applies to both sides. It\'s just that this means death saving throws are really just a countdown of the rounds you have to get to the player and get them healed in. But a smart party stays more or less together, and spreads healing ability across each member. Healing will almost always be directly at hand, whereas, if the enemy wants to disrupt player formation, they have to go at it from multiple sides, or else match it. And going at it from multiple sides spreads the enemy out, making getting healed harder, while matching player formation just makes it a straight contest sure, but leaves the enemy open to area of effect abilities, of which players will usually have more and a greater variety. Because the enemies which have those (take dragons, for instance) are generally built to be a higher level of difficulty than a player needs to be in order to have access to them. But when fighting other creatures with class levels, the DM needs to be conscious of local themes and adjust likely enemy composition. The party is by nature generally a group of outliers because they have less need to do so. Which doesn\'t even touch on the fact that the Players are more often good or neutral than evil, and as a party have intrinsic motivation to keep one-another alive. The enemies will less often have that same motivation (less often than basically always being anything less than basically always) and that\'s doubly true because that means they will most often be neutral or evil. \n\nAll of these factors intertwine as well. Each makes the other make things even easier. But even in cases where none of these are factors, where even being outliers bound by no traditions or codes gives no advantage - combat with other groups of adventurers or special task forces, which are some of the toughest types of encounters FOR THOSE REASONS - the other group is limited by their own motivation. If that motivation is to kill the Players, then that puts them back under one or more of the disadvantages outlined above. If that motivation merely interferes with the Players motivations, that group will be less motivated to destroy the Players than will be vice versa AND the opposing group will be distracted by their primary motivation. If the players motivation interferes with the opposing groups motivations, however, the players unpredictability comes back into play, the dynamics of creative energy and action/reaction. On top of all of that, there\'s always a greater chance that the players will somehow turn the opposing group into allies than there is for the reverse. \n\nClever, dedicated DMs can overcome all of these problems with effort... but that\'s just the thing. It takes cleverness, effort. The players enjoy these benefits almost automatically. If they start getting clever in turn... the DM has almost no choice but to turn up the difficulty beyond what\'s recommended, abandoning the system of balance present in 5e entirely.', ""Doesn't the DMG specifically say to NOT strictly use CR for balancing encounters? Instead there's a formula involving creature XP, CR, player level, and the number of creatures vs the number of players? Even then it also refers to understanding matchups, vulnerabilities, etc. In practice I'm not sure that's much better, but it's a bit more nuanced than just looking at CR."", 'Encounter balance isn\'t an idea new to 5e, or to modern games, so I\'m a little confused what the premise of this discussion is.\n\nThe D&amp;D Basic box set (which, as near as I can tell, is what a lot of OSR gamers are tying to get back to,) has explicit language in it about how the dungeon should be deadlier as you get lower. There\'s rules for what monsters live on what dungeon levels. ""Balanced"" encounters have existed as an idea almost as long as D&amp;D has.', 'What is ""balance"" could be picked part, but if CR ratings are ""balanced encounters"", then I like the use of CR\'s.  However, if I have a party of level 10 players, I don\'t throw CR 10s at them for every encounter.  Sometimes the hero needs to strugg, but other times they need to feel larger than life.  I mix them up to give both experiences.', 'It has, but never previously have the rules as written compounded on top of it in the way 5e does. Pointing out how that already favors players was the foundation of the point I was making, and would be the foundation of several such strings of player-advantage I could point out, which are present in 5e and less present, or not existent, in other editions. ', 'Not to be contrarian, but telling the players that the world is unfair when it is, is fair. Telling the players it is fair when it is not, is unfair. Basically, many player have an implied assumption that any encounter that is prewritten (such as a dungeon crawl) is not going to wipe you if you play reasonably well and roll reasonably well. You can see here, the crux of the issue is that suboptimal play AND suboptimal luck put a wrinkle in the objective ""fairness"" of the game right away.\n\nPlayers obsessed with fairness, should still be aware of when their luck is turning and act accordingly. Let\'s say that the average number of player rolls in a combat is 60  (5 players, 2 rolls per turn, over 6 turns): let\'s say that optimal PLAY allows for a 50/50 success ratio (success here is measured as rolls above the median/average possibility, because they are making perfect decisions, only their rolls are a deciding factor on their success or failure), that means they will need 30 ""good rolls"" over 6 turns to ""win"", they should be aware on turn 4 that they only have 10 good rolls, and start preparing to flee. If they don\'t they are using the gambler\'s fallacy (throwing good money after bad in the assumption that over time the numbers will eventually favor the player). The biggest thing I notice is that players obsessed with ""fairness"" make an assumption that means winning in an inevitability. If I make my encounters PERFECTLY balanced, (and that is a big if), that means losing is a reasonably likely outcome and they should plan accordingly.\n\nIn a way, balanced is almost harder, because it implies safety that cold hard dice rarely reinforce. Almost every DM I know flubs rolls to adjust the difficulty on the fly, because fights that are too easy OR too hard aren\'t fun.', 'I always prefer to start with ""monsters by terrain"" first, and then kajiggle the CR from there.  \n\n\n', ""&gt;he'd often create encounters or sessions having no idea how his PCs would survive \n\nAs long as he isn't going aggressive on his players, its not the gm's problem to figure out how players are gonna solve a thing.

If you foreshadow opposition so that the players 'get it' then your fine.\n\nYou don't just level Strahd down because the players decided to go straight to his castle at the start of the adventure. You don't balance the encounters around them. The players know when you say this guy is a vampire lord that made a pact with dark powers that he is bad news.  If the players don't go and slay the heart in the castle, you don't just turn off his extra hp buffers. If they don't deal with his steward you don't just leave him out of the fight. "", 'I got into tabletop gaming through 5e and recently started taking a look at other systems, and one thing I noticed is that there\'s a shitton more newbies to tabletop RPGs (like me, once upon a time) in 5e than other systems. That might have something to do with most sessions seeming easy compared to what I\'m used to, since the group I run with is full of 3.5 veterans and a DM who makes a hobby of converting older modules.  Anyway, some things I learned from that group:\n\n* **Don\'t be afraid to require win conditions that aren\'t ""defeating the enemy"".** The most memorable encounter I\'ve had so far involved trying to retrieve an Artifact of Doom from the villain before he could activate it, which required him to put some blood on it. It was already partially on its way to activation during the encounter because he was wounded, and causing him to bleed on it more or drop it would have spelled disaster. This ruled out harming him in any significant way, and we could \'win\' while still leaving him alive (even though we all wanted to kill him.) Complicating matters was the fact that he was already in a fight with another NPC, who didn\'t know about the artifact or how to activate it. Suffice to say, the looming threat of one wrong move spelling an instant TPK really helped heighten the tension. There were so many moving parts that we almost didn\'t make it out with our asses intact, so winning actually felt like it meant something.\n* That was a boss fight, so your ""regular"" encounters don\'t really need to be that extreme. That being said, you can still run with this. **Deliberately trying to not kill or injure an enemy is usually more difficult than just kicking their ass.** Another memorable fight I had was in AL, where during a Halloween event, the DM threw a Nilbog and a shitton of mind-controlled kids at us. (I later looked at the stat block and found out that the kids were just reskinned regular goblins, but I\'m not complaining; most first graders IRL are basically goblins anyway.) Word of advice: the nilbog being CR 1 is a goddamned lie. Two of our party members, at level 5, almost died to this fucking thing because of poor rolls and the fact that we were getting the shit beaten out of us by little kids we couldn\'t hurt.  But good fucking god, it was hilarious.\n* Keep in mind that there\'s two ways for a character to be removed from play, more or less: fail something (usually a save) twice or more, or make a really fucking stupid decision. For shitty dice, I give players hints whenever I can that they might want to start trying to mitigate this: before a sea hag uses her Death Glare, for instance, I might tell a frightened PC\'s player: ""she\'s scanning the room, and as she comes to your general direction you can see her smile a bit"". That gives them time to realize they might want to *not* also make a shitty decision. For shitty decisions, you really shouldn\'t feel too bad.\n* If an enemy has lair actions, really cool abilities, or so on, you should totally use them and milk them for all they\'re worth. Have your enemies behave optimally unless there\'s a very good in-character reason for them not to. That being said, if your players are being clever, you should reward that. Just maybe not too much. I would give them an edge that tilts things slightly in their favor if they *continue* to be creative and clever, without guaranteeing a victory.\n* I personally always give my encounters a means for the PCs to make it out alive without fighting. Sometimes this just means running away, sometimes it\'s diplomacy, sometimes it\'s something else. It doesn\'t always work, but if shit hits the fan, it doesn\'t hurt to try.\n* Unless your party is very low level (like 1-2), don\'t be afraid to up the number of enemies per encounter, or encounters per day. If your party has a monk or warlock, you\'ll definitely need to work in time for a short rest. If not...eh, just use your better judgment.\n* Most importantly, making things perfectly balanced is an exercise in futility. However, you should probably just try to avoid making things so grossly unfair that your players feel cheated or like their decisions don\'t matter, and that goes for things being too easy as well as being too hard.\n\nInstead of some nebulous idea of ""fairness"", I tend to just build encounters based on what makes sense for the narrative and setting at the time. Obviously don\'t throw a beholder at a level 1 party, but this mostly works out. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ-yyhZcXQU) talks about how there\'s two ways you can stay more or less balanced: you can be easier in combat, but tougher on the rules, or you can allow for more creative interpretations of the rules while being more brutal in combat. I kind of like the latter approach better.\n\nThe tendency for combat to seem too easy comes from two places, I think: the first is that 5e attracted a lot of new players (like me!) who might not be used to encounter building. The second might be a knee-jerk reaction from veteran players who remember when adversarial DMing was more common - basically, where DMs would count killing off a character or somesuch as ""winning"". But as long as you don\'t view it as a competition, there\'s nothing wrong with being kind of a dick to your players in terms of encounter difficulty.', 'Balance is important to DnD because you need to know what your parties *can* survive to know what they can\'t.\n\nColville tends to be a \'DnD apologist\'. Whatever the latest version of DnD does, he defends it or says ""you can always ignore the rules or fudge something"".  \n\nGreat games don\'t need you to fudge anything - you can always follow them 100% rules-as-written and they work.', 'The only thing the system can balance for is a straight up, unimaginative fight within a closed system.\n\nIn reality, virtually any RPG scenario that doesn\'t suck is not a closed system, the players are imaginative, and they\'ll try to avoid a straight up fight whenever possible.\n\nFor example, in my current campaign the PCs were staging a raid on a huge, underground, technomantic tower which was a major project for the bad guys. After inflicting some casualties, the PCs were forced to withdraw for a couple of days (for reasons which aren\'t particularly important). The bad guys responded by saying, ""Enough of this."" And sent reinforcements from all of their nearby facilities. The technomantic tower was now an encounter vastly beyond the PCs\' level.\n\nWhat did the PCs do?\n\nThey sapped the Tower, collapsed the entire structure, and picked off the survivors as they struggled to escape the wreckage.', 'I and a fellow monk beat a CR6 demon...we were lvl4...now 6.

The point about thieves\' guilds or Robin Hood is pretty effective--when a person or group defines their own moral code that is in opposition to another moral code, then the view of law vs chaos is different depending on which code you happen to agree with. \n\nPut another way, it\'s considered Lawful Good to follow the rules if the rules are good, and Chaotic Good if you break the rules because the rules are bad. But in that case, isn\'t law vs chaos just a judgement call on whether or not the rules being used are good or bad? \n\nAlternatively, maybe you assume that there is a single universal moral code. In this view, Lawful Good means ""strictly good all the time"" and Chaotic Good means ""mostly good, most of the time"". In that case...isn\'t Chaotic Good just Lazy Good? Likewise, if Lawful Evil means ""does bad things for a semi-justified reason"" and Chaotic Evil means ""does bad things for no reason at all"", then isn\'t Lawful Evil just Evil-Lite? This is also why Chaotic Neutral makes everyone immediately suspicious--this would mean something like ""does things, and is good or evil more or less by accident"" which sounds pretty close to ""doesn\'t care if they hurt people"", which is generally seen as ""evil"". \n\nI would also point out the false symmetry of the Law vs Chaos, Good vs Evil dynamic. Most people would agree that putting a LG character and a LE character in the same party is a bad time; a paladin of truth and justice fundamentally cannot work with an antipaladin of greed and pain. But, putting a LG character and a CG character is no big deal because they\'re both good guys, who want to help the innocent. The law/chaos distinction feels a lot more like a change in the flavor of goodness or badness, not a fundamental shift in perspective.\n\nEither Law and Chaos are context-sensitive, in which case using them as a character descriptor is useless, or they\'re context-agnostic, in which case Lawful or Chaotic just become nudges in one direction or the other. A context-agnostic rating system becomes an ethics report card, where Lawful Good is an A+, Chaotic Good is an A-, Chaotic Neutral is a C-, Lawful Evil is a D+, and Chaotic Evil is an F.\n\nThat is what 4e realized, which is Wizards they chopped the corners off and flattened it into a straight line. But gamers are nothing if not nostalgic, so they put it back in for 5e, although they compromised by making it mechanically meaningless.', ""Honestly no matter how you subdivide alignments there's going to be contradictions and confusion. The real solution is to stop tying game mechanics to alignment; they should be at most a descriptor for your character, not a proscriptive choice like class and race.  \n\n\nI'm also iffy on the way the OP here defines the differences between Lawful Good and Good and between Chaotic Evil and Evil. As cliche as they might be, one of the reasons alignment charts with various characters from a property are a thing is because they're a demonstration of the different nuances in moral behavior. Neutral and Chaotic Good certainly never struck me as 'good because you expect a reward'. Han Solo already \\*had\\* his reward. He came back to help Luke because it was the right thing to do."", 'I\'m not very familiar with the Pathfinder setting, and it\'s been awhile since I\'ve played any RPG, but on the mortal level I view law vs chaos as ""civilization"" vs barbarism. The barbarian character may be an exemplar of the laws of their tribe, but the barbarian is an outsider to civil society and is usually required to be a chaotic alignment. Likewise, the fact that a thieves guild has it\'s own laws is irrelevant because thieves are in conflict with civil society and therefore chaotic.']"

rpg,t3_a421hv,"First Time TimeWatch one-shotI'm running a TimeWatch one shot this weekend, and I'm nervous that I'm going to screw up the GUMSHOE aspects dramatically (outside of a playtest one shot of TW I've never played/run a GUMSHOE game), particularly failing to manage the General/Investigative divide correctly and trying to draw on the wrong tropes.  (""Make a Perception test!  Oh, wait..."")

&amp;#x200B;

To make things more/less complicated, my concept is a bit unusual:

* The PCs are local-time natives recruited to prevent a nuclear war.  So no MEMs, no PaciFist, no mesh.  I'll grant them mental-based time travel with some limited temporal range, as the idea is to have them do more localized time travel (stay in modern era) than to jump around to remote historical eras.
* The PCs get no real TimeWatch support, as TW's first effort to prevent the war failed (it was originally shipped nukes that triggered the war, but stopping that just meant that the one of the sources of nukes - a sub - fired its missiles and triggered the war anyway.  The resulting Chronal Stability hit means that TW is too unlikely to send anyone back in time, but they did manage to send a signal that activated a local asset that recruits and equips the PCs with mental engrams of actual TW agents (so the PCs will have access to info they don't normally have, which should work with players that don't know TW at all - the PC would have to consult their new memories just like the player would have to ask me).
* The Erezu are responsible (of course), so the PCs will need to infiltrate a military base to find out which sub is out there and the crew, then jump back a few months to intercept the crew before they depart to discover who the Erezu have taken over and prevent it.  
* I don't expect to do a Time Chase unless it seems appropriate - As a time travel junkie it never meshed well with the various models of time travel I prefer, but I'm open to adopting it in the moment if it seems cool.

I have a limited time span (3-5 hours), so I'm assuming that will fill the available time.  I feel fairly comfortable making crap up on the spot (I do a lot of seat-of-the-pants GMing in various systems) so my primary concern is making sure I adjust to the GUMSHOE differences well.

My players responded that dying was kinda like a little mini-game because you got to make a new character.  That's probably the wisest design move of SotDL being a higher lethality game, is that creating a character is exciting because there's so much experimentation in the choices in later levels.\n\nI also liked creating a global landmark for campaign leveling - despite being separate parties, we still stuck with Shadow's Campaign Level.  For example, the campaign ran on a Shadow of Colossus kill the Macguffins, and the leveling rule was clear.  For each macguffin found and killed, the campaign leveled up.  And at each major level up to Expert and Master and then finally Level 10, there'd be a big event that strikes the setting.  So it was a cool metagame that helped drive the players forward and encouraged them to cooperate with one another.\n\nWe have not played much DCC.  While my players do like it, they simply state they like Shadows better when it comes to that sort of fantasy rpg.  I think DCC may be a little too chaotic for their liking.  And the class system of SotDL really did spoil them greatly."", 'I ran a \\~25 sessions long sandbox campaign with DCC RPG, although most of it was more of an urban crawl in a sprawling city. I\'m planning to do it again next year, because it was a lot of fun - the party ended it at 3-4th level, and had 30 casualties (mostly level 0s). DCC RPG\'s ""quest for it"" mentality is perfect for sandbox campaigns: instead of making cool stuff your players want to have part of the advancement system, just give them a hook and send them on an adventure to earn it. DCC RPG also has spell and mishap results that can change characters or even an entire region in unexpected and radical ways. And change and personal goals what can really move a sandbox campaign forward.', ""I've played neither game, but I'm currently running a West Marches campaign under 5e and familiar with both SotDL and DCC. Personally, I'd go with DCC as I think SotDL is a bit too loosey-goosey for that style of campaign. I think SotDL would work better with a character- and story-arc style of play, using leveling milestone. To me, SotDL is sort of a hybrid of old school OSR feel, with the design sensibilities of a modern game. By contrast, DCC is almost tailor made for a West Marches style of campaign. Definitely old school dungeon crawling fun with a focus on player skill rather than PC abilities.""]"

rpg,t3_a41lih,"Using Real World Places to Inspire Your Homebrew World.Greetings folks. 

I recently started a new video series on making a homebrew campaign from scratch and documenting each step. 

In this video I look at how to use real world places to inspire your homebrew worlds. Check it out here: https://youtu.be/9XIbZuaTbUk

I find that choosing a real time and place (like the Roman Empire, or the Old West) as a starting point for inspiration really helps you get a clear picture of the kind of campaign you’re going to be making. And you can then use this allegory to help describe your game to your players and they will have a better idea of what to expect going forward. 

Do you use real world places and events as inspiration for your games? 

Much love
Anto

rpg,t3_a41bja,"How do I prevent a puzzle from breaking the flow of the game?Hi! I've been dming for about a year, and I really enjoy creating themed riddles and puzzles, and adding them to my campaigns. If you do this kind of puzzles, you know that sometimes they are too easy for players to solve, and sometimes too hard, building this kind of encounters, and making it balanced, is quite difficult.

Anyway, i've been experimenting with different ways of setting up this puzzles to try to not break the flow of the game, when the party gets stucked for hours on a mandatory puzzle or riddle, immersion is lost, people get frustrated, sometimes you even end up calling it a day. In the end, if you have to give the players the solution because the encounter was too hard, it feels bad for me as a dm, and for the players aswell.

So, in order to solve this, the first thing i did was making puzzles ""side objectives"". Things like solving a riddle to open a journal with information, or solving a puzzle to open a wizard's armory. You can do it and get good rewards from it, but you can ignore them if you want and continue with the campaign as if it wasnt there. This is fine, but what my group did was take a look at the puzzle and if they couldn't solve it in five minutes they'd just move on. I know i should let the players do more or less what they want, but i worked hard on some of this puzzles and I want them to at least give it a good shot.

So, what i'm trying next, is placing this puzzles where they can't avoid them, but with the option of brute-forcing their way through them. I think this would allow me to make even harder puzzles with even greater rewards, and if they give up, they could just destroy whatever obstacle is blocking their path. The problem i forsee with this alternative, is that i might have to start the campaign with a disclamer, telling them that this is how puzzles are going to work, but at least i won't have to give them the solution mid-game. Also, at some point they might think they are on ""a puzzle room"" and try to destroy things where i didn't intend them to do.

I'd like to hear your thoughts about this, how did you solve this problem? Any advice is welcome!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a41bja/how_do_i_prevent_a_puzzle_from_breaking_the_flow/,"[""If your players don't like anal sex stop trying to stick it up their butts.\n\n* Switch to players that are interested in puzzles.\n* Give them all the clues.

I told everyone ""feel free to leave at this point but if anyone wants to stick around and solve it I\'ll be here."" The thinking was that they\'ll most likely solve it in-between sessions but most of them stayed and solved it in the end.', ""Some of the best puzzles I've used in games had a couple features I'll talk about, and then I'll talk about one of the best puzzles I've experienced as a player. \n\nSo, the way I see it, if you make a puzzle a larger part of a story, dungeon crawl or plotline there are a couple ways to make it more exciting for all players. \n\n1. If the puzzle room is a trap that the PCs have to escape or be severely harmed or surely die, all the characters become quickly focused when the walls are literally closing in. You might want to give them a couple possible ways to escape the trap in this instance incase they screw up the main puzzle to stop their deaths, or just be open to player improv. Its also okay to offer false-hope for escape, a trap door that when pryed open only makes things worse by now flooding the room with acid for example. \n2. Make the puzzle a thing the PCs can come back to, make other stuff going on to investigate either as a distraction or something to give the more combat-focused players to go deal with. I remember one game where I simply had a regenerating imprisoned Dragon in chains in a nearby room, the players were fascinated by the undying dragon and were dealing with it and some other monsters in the area, while 1 or 2 PCs tried to figure out the main puzzle problem. Also you can make it so that if the PCs take too long solving the trap, certain mechanisms open, one of the situations I used released a small army of undead were released by clockworks when one part of the puzzle was solved, then the others had to fight off the horde while the Wizard was solving the rest of the puzzle. \n3. The keys to solving the Puzzle or Puzzles is spread out through multiple areas, each area has something interesting to explore, maybe some monsters to fight or even cool magic items or something the PCs can use to help them through it. This means finishing the puzzle isn't just halting the adventure, it requires you completely explore the areas and fight the enemies while working towards a larger goal.\n\nAs for being a player, the best Puzzle that I remember in a Fantasy game, was an ordinary sort of D&amp;D game up until we reached this part of the story. It was a large white tower that once we went inside we trapped in. We basically had to find a Phylactery that held the soul of our main rival evil NPC and destroy it so we could harm him, otherwise he was an invincible monster. The Phylactery was on a raised platform in the center of the room and we had to explore and interact with various different mechanisms, suspended platforms and different rooms and halls, occasionally encountering a guardian monster at each area or Mimics pretending to be the mechanism we needed (ever lockpicked a lock that's not a lock? Its how you lose fingers). Anyway, while this was all going on and we were all working so hard to solve the puzzle to get the prize, none of us even suspected what was actually going on. The DM was keeping track of who went off alone, during our search of the place, one of us happened to encounter an old scroll or something: mentioning the place was guarded by a Doppleganger. And that's the rub, one of the PCs was replaced by a Doppleganger during the puzzle solving process and we didn't know who. The DM was having us all roleplay our characters as normal, but we got more and more paranoid. Finally I was helping another PC, encouraging us to go off alone together - since we didn't trust the others. Turns out I was the doppleganger all along and attacked him when he was alone - almost killed him. The other PCs slayed the doppleganger and then searched where I went off alone the first time - eventually found my character tied up in a crevice someplace. But anyway, that scenario was excellent. We were all so distracted with the complex puzzle, we didn't realize there was a shapechanging creature in there with us... "", 'Something I’ve found is important for puzzles is to be absolutely sure that they are intuitive enough to be solved without outside knowledge unless you put a piece of the solution in an obvious location that they would encounter before the puzzle.  For example, the players find a cube with varying numbers of divots on the sides (d6 with pips).  Later, they find a door with square hole(s).  If they look or feel into the holes, they find an arrangement of buttons on the back wall of each hole.  This puzzle can used with two solutions: either the cube(s) must be placed into the hole(s) in such a way that none of the buttons are pressed (buttons line up with divots of the d6) or the cubes must be placed into the holes in such a way that all of the buttons are pressed.\nThis puzzle makes it easy to use tactile and visual elements, as you only need a few d6s and a sheet of paper.  In addition, you can expand the puzzle by adding holes and scattering cubes around the dungeon, which could give uninterested players something to do while the others try to solve the puzzle.  If you want to alter the difficulty, you can have the puzzle give an observable effect when a cube is placed incorrectly (easier by just having the hole eject the cube, harder by spitting fire/lightning/acid/poison).', ""I don't do puzzles too often anymore because I've been running low prep games that don't work well with them, but when I did, these were some of my favorite types to use\n\n* Portable Puzzles. The player finds a puzzle box or a book or whatever that can be carried around the dungeon with them. That way anyone who is interested can focus on the puzzle while the rest of the party can continue exploring. The key to this one is making it clear that either the solution needs to be applied to a different area or can be applied as soon as it's solved, that way the players won't think they're stuck in the area they found it in. Works well in one of the first few rooms of a dungeon, and can be combined with a scavenger hunt situation where they find clues to solving it in various rooms to encourage exploration. \n\n* The Zelda/Indie game puzzle. You have them solve ever increasingly complex versions of the same puzzles over and over throughout the dungeon. In the first room is the simplest application: there is a lit brazier and a stick nearby, there is a locked door flanked by a lit torch and an unlit torch, lighting the second torch opens the door. Barely a puzzle with the answer spoonfed to you. Then you layer another mechanic on it. Then another and another. The players already have the answer from the first room, light both torches to open a door, so the fun comes from the planning, teamwork, and execution of the puzzles. This requires the most planning as you have to holistically build the dungeon in a way that teaches the players without holding their hand and makes them feel accomplished instead of railroaded. These sorts of puzzles lend well to thematic dungeons. \n\n* Sandbox Puzzle. This is similar to the zelda/ indie game puzzle, but a little more freeform. The players find some sort of item that interacts with the world, then find that the dungeon is the perfect playground for this item. Think the later levels of a Portal game or the sand wand dungeon in LoZ: Twilight Princess. The item does something fun and tactile to increase the parties mobility, but by the nature of an RPG isn't the only way to progress. Sure it's way cooler to make a bridge of sand to cross the gap, but if you really want to you can just use your rope and grappling hook to climb up to that door anyway. This sort of item gating works well if they explore the dungeon a bit before finding the item, because it throws the contents into a new light when they find the item. That's why there's so much sand below those doors in the middle of the wall, or white walls on the other side of grates, etc. The things to be aware of from this one is trying to make it too linear because the players may choose to sequence break, and coming up with an item that works with multiple copies or have a way of giving the other party members something to do while one player uses it so they don't get bored. Also you must be consistent with what the item can and can't do because players will test its limits in ways you won't expect. \n\n* Fragile Puzzle. Sure, being able to brute force your way past a puzzle is a good alternative to getting stuck on a puzzle, but it's not very interesting. You smash the puzzle wall and go to the next room and fight five orcs, meh. Make smashing the puzzle easy and viscerally rewarding as well as dangerous. Describe the delicate crystal vials full of bubbling liquids, the precisely arrayed lasers creating a laser pentagram around a cheery imp, the pipes with meters indicating pressure well into the danger zone. These puzzles have at least two methods of solving them, long and delicate or quick and chaotic. The bubbling liquid expands into a rampaging ooze on contact with air, the imp is freed and wreaks mayhem if the pentagram is interrupted even by millimeters, the room is near instantly filled with dangerous gases. The players have solved it but have put themselves in a more precarious position than if they took the long route, but at least they're not bored! The important thing to remember about this one is to make the consequences fun, it's not a punishment for not finding your puzzle entertaining, it's a consolation prize for not getting to spend more time on the puzzle."", ""Portable puzzles can be good if you just like making and giving them puzzles to do.  For example let's think of the purpose behind the puzzle on the wizard's armory.   Maybe it's to acquire some fancy magic items.  Okay so let's make it portable.  The armory is open, inside is a chest with a puzzle lock on it.  They can take the chest and work on the puzzle as they go.\n\nThe puzzle isn't the only thing to do right now.  This is like a portable puzzle, but basically there's other stuff they can do while they stew on the puzzle.  For example, there's a door with a puzzle lock on it, but there's other pathways to explore too.  So they can work on the puzzle as they explore other parts of the adventure.\n\nIf you haven't seen it, remember the [Three Clue Rule](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule)."", ""Wouldn't a brute force option be the same issue as when they look at the puzzle for five minutes then give up and move on? Now it'll be looking at it for five minutes then brute forcing it.\n\nHow long in real life do you want them to spend on your puzzle? Maybe you need to restrict the amount of time you spend on making them to start to relatively match how long they spend on it."", 'a long corridor at the left is the puzzle on the wall and you see ""..."" at the end of the corridor. that will make them continue if they fail to solve it, then make them back track so they remember the puzzle at the end of the dungeond', ""When I try to hit a bad guy in the game, my GM doesn't make me try to hit him in IRL. I just make a combat roll.\n\nSo when I come across a puzzle, it doesn't make sense for me to solve it IRL. I just make the appropriate INT or whatever roll for my character.""]"
rpg,t3_a415i1,"Isn't there a paradox between sandboxes and level progression systems?Hey, I've got a question,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really interested in hexcrawls and other sandbox exploration games. But the vast majority of them seem to be played with Dungeons &amp; Dragons in mind, or with other rules based on various D&amp;D editions, from Pathfinder to various OSR games.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, D&amp;D and its direct followers are unique for the large difference in character power: characters of different levels will not be able to face the same kind of dangers. While most games have experience progression, it's rarely as central as in D&amp;D. I feel it's exacerbated in more recent editions (say, D&amp;D3 to 5, including Pathfinder), because there now are methods to calculate how hard a fight is supposed to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that PCs are supposed not to get straight into dangerous combats, but it can be very hard to evaluate, and there are few ways to correct mistakes. I feel that in D&amp;D, running away is usually difficult without the right magic, so punishment will be death.

&amp;#x200B;

This experience progression forces linearity on campaigns. If low-level PCs go to the wrong part of the sandbox, they will all die. It can be mitigated by giving them a lot of information on how dangerous this or that area are, but again, punishment for getting it wrong seems to often be death. This is only partly a problem in video games such as Baldur's Gate or Morrowind because, yes, Durlag's Tower and Molag Amur will kill low-level PCs, but dying and reloading is always possible.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess my questions are: am I missing something? And what would be better systems for exploration sandboxes?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a415i1/isnt_there_a_paradox_between_sandboxes_and_level/,"['Part of the OSR style of games is that parties should know when to *not* get into fights, because it should be dangerous even at an appropriate level. It seems like you\'re talking yourself out of entirely appropriate solutions: let players see that certain areas are dangerous because there are huge monsters roaming around, or signs like trees toppled over, or make the most dangerous creatures be intelligent and warn the adventurers away. Have them run into a single Lizardman scout that they can barely defeat together, so that they know not to mess with a whole battalion of Lizardmen over the next hill. As they level up they can progress from having to avoid dangerous regions and creatures, to being able to fight them.\n\nI\'ve played Hot Springs Island using Dungeon Crawl Classics, and while a number of our characters died, that was largely how it worked: the creatures in the jungle were dangerous but the Ogres and Fuegonauts (an army including salamanders, fire elementals, and obsidian golems) were downright deadly, but they were either giant ""fuck-off"" signals (if you see a large-house-sized creature made of black glass and blades in the distance and you decide to head towards it, that\'s on you) or were obviously dangerous and just told us to fuck off unless we found something they wanted and could negotiate with. When we did attack an obsidian guard (because the Ogres wanted us to prove we could), it was a big deal that involved a full session of planning, luring, and (barely) execution, but we had leveled up and gotten better equipment by then.\n\nedit: Also, to be clear, this is not the only way that a sandbox can be run, but it\'s the only way that I\'ve played one so it\'s a style I can talk about from experience.', 'Yes if PCs get into combat with and fail to retreat from dangerous or powerful creatures they tend to die.  This is a feature.\n\nCaution, rumor collection, negotiations, retreat and trickery are all important to non-linear tabletop role playing.', 'Sandboxes are made to explore, and it\'s perfectly natural for a party to run into something they can\'t face head-to-head. In the campaign I\'m in, our party has been surgically striking at high-level targets, and at one point turned two high-level groups against each other, then mopped up the remains. We pretty consistently punch about two levels above our own, just because we\'re crafty bastards who get lucky once in a while. I started with OSRs, and I\'m new to D&amp;D, so the whole CR thing baffles me. It\'s set up so we can win every fight? What is this, a button-masher game?\n\nI think the part that you\'re missing is the ""run away"" part. As a GM, you need to not force fights; if the PCs have a chance to see what they\'re getting into, let them! And as a PC, don\'t be afraid to run away from a fight! It sucks leaving behind a lot of treasure, but when it\'s that or your life, you learn to live with it. Until you can stock up on magical items and a level or two, and come back and blast right on through.', 'OSR games usually have a lot smaller power differential between levels than a lot of D&amp;D editions.', ""the power curve in 2e was definitely flatter. a 5 level difference in party members wasnt a big deal.  They also had non unified xp tables for each class, so by the time you hit 1.5m xp, your thief was hitting 17 while your mage was hitting 14.  It may be nostalgia goggles, but I seem to remember 'running away' was much more 'doable' in 2e than in later editions."", ""In older versions of D&amp;D, and most OSR games, levels mean a lot less. Random HP, overall lower stats, and little power increase is normal. Same goes for monsters. Instead of 200+ HP a dragon may have 68 HP. \n\nThe game also operates with the understanding that players will have hirelings and henchmen, so PC parties can expand to 20+ characters pretty quickly.  \n\nThey also assume a fair amount of player skill. You will hear about the dread necrodragon before you ever see it, and people will tell you where it lairs. This means you can avoid it if you want, or dare it's wrath."", 'Problem? No, that’s kind of the point. It’s the trade off that makes a sandbox appealing. You get more freedom, which means you might go places you shouldn’t. If you take away that danger, it starts feeling really artificial.', 'You don\'t need to start new characters on level 1 and can keep a particular level range that adjusts to the current state of the campaign.\n\nOften the exploration and danger of a sandbox is the thrill of it.  You go into a new area, get killed, but that\'s fine you just make a new character.  Each new iteration of the party has additional metagame knowledge to leverage.  In a way the traditional sandbox plays like a video game, you can as players actually get better at playing that campaign.  A well made sandbox is like a big puzzle box that can be solved in different ways.  And so the measure of success is changed.  The survival of any individual character is not the primary standard for progress in the campaign, it\'s the collected knowledge and slow conquest of the sandbox over the lives of many characters.  So in a traditional campaign, the singular party might be the measure of success to the players.  But perhaps in a certain Sandbox, the survival and development of a frontier outpost is now the primary measure of success, and you can reinforce that by tying things such as Starting Level and other benefits to that outpost.  The outpost now becomes almost a ""shared character"" for all who play that campaign and serves as a legacy from all the fallen characters.\n\nI find the best systems/styles for sandbox play are ones that don\'t frontload a character with a lot of baggage.  You can create or generate a character in a couple minutes and get right to playing.  I also like systems with lower HP inflation as that\'s often the primary cause of the Level Gap problem.  I also tend to go with systems with less predictability.  Predictability often kills the spirit of exploration and taking risks.  For example in Pathfinder, you can often measure with a fair degree of accuracy your chances of winning any particular encounter.  But that means there\'s no reason to take risk without calculations.  Whereas in Warhammer, there\'s always a slim chance you might win even if you throw yourself against the worst odds.\n\nMy favorite systems so far for sandbox play: Warhammer Fantasy 2e, Stars Without Number Revised, Shadow of the Demonlord.\n\nI have used DnD5e and even Pathfinder for sandbox play, but kept the party within +/-1 level of the ""Campaign Level"".  The campaign level went up based on the average of the party.', 'If everywhere you can go is a place appropriate to your power level, and there’s no chance of going somewhere way too tough or too easy, then that’s just boring.\n\nLevel progression means that different zones have different danger levels and it’s important to plan and research your trip.\n\nAnd as you level up the more you can risk short cuts to cross the map quickly, or go deal with problems you’ve known about for ages but been unable to resolve.\n\nHex-crawl works better with levelled systems than unlevelled systems.', ""When I was doing 4th edition I just always used custom monsters and scaled them to the party's current level no matter where they went. It was actually part of an agreement I had with the group that I would keep everything level appropriate and they were free to follow whatever story threads sounded interesting. Most of the enemies weren't even monsters, they were custom named NPCs. The group eventually just got bogged down in one particular town that had a lot going on and the campaign stalled out when I had to take a break for work."", ""In a nutshell: yes. D&amp;D-style games with vast power gaps between levels are not really designed for exploring, but for linear progression.\n\nBUT Sandbox only states the idea that the players choose what they do. It does not necessarily mean that you pre-load the map with random level encounters.\n\nAs a DM you could still prepare the main roster of the monsters to be in the level range of the players. I.e. if they find a drow outpost, it doesn't need to be always an outpost full of level 18 drow fighters. A crypt full of undead can vary greatly in level, but it is still a crypt full of undead. And even the red dragon in the mountain can be of different sizes.\n\nSo there are ways to get around the level progression issue. But be carefull to not make it too much Oblivion, where bandits suddenly have obsidian armor, due to level progression."", ""Well, it should be on the players to be careful and not get into situations they cannot handle, but since a lot of players are used to only being given challenges that they are able to defeat, you might want to hold their hand a little. First of all, warn them that they won't be able to beat everything they encounter. Then, if they encounter something they think they can beat that they really can't, you can have them make intelligence (or something) rolls to see if their characters know better."", ""Why would the area for low levels be linear unless you made it linear?\n\nSandbox doesn't mean you can go anywhere as if you're a tourist.\n\nIf you want exploration as first priority maybe don't use levels, it'll get in the way of what you want."", ' So here\'s how the DM who ran the best sandbox campaign I ever played in. \n\nFirst, make sure that they know that running is definitely a thing they might need to do, and give hints to it when it comes up. \n\nSecond, have a world map that shows some things, but not everything, like topography, but certain towns/cities, and roads, but not everything like far off keeps, dungeons, monster camps etc.\n\nThird, and this one made the game great, lie. \n\nYeah, lie. \n\nThis game was not actually a sandbox, it just appeared that way. He had an order of events planned out, but they were largely setting agnostic, the owlbear nest could have happened in any of the wilds, and then when we went to sell stuff from that quest in a big city, he could put the thieves guild plotline in, no matter which city were chose.  Throw in a few, ""Hey guys, this looks a little too big for you"" encounters intentionally to create the feel of that being a possibility. \n\nOh we can take these two quests, but because we didn\'t take that one, we weren\'t there in time to save the village. Doesn\'t matter, had we taken the other quest, it would have been the other village we did save, and now we have a hook into this over arching Orc warlord quest. It\'s personal, because we need to avenge those we lost. \n\nThink of it as level scaling ala Oblivion. Go straight to Kvatch, and you fight scamps. Do other things, and guess what you\'re still there just in time to be the hero, only now you\'re fighting Dremora. ', 'A simple level cap can eliminate a lot of these problems and make the world as a whole feel a lot more believable. Set the max level at 5-6 and go really easy on magic items and D&amp;D starts feeling a lot more like Lord of the Rings instead of WoW. Specifically for 3e D&amp;D there were some rules called ""epic 6"", presumably there is something similar for 5e.', ""I think a sandbox would be rather boring WITHOUT a level progression system. Equipment and point-based progression systems generally don't change the overall power level of the game significantly enough to make a sandbox campaign fulfilling.  \n\n\nThe trick is to make sure PCs understand what the risks of each area are, as well as their options for GingTFO if necessary. Just like most people are not dumb enough to go pick a fight with a dangerous street gang without back-up, equipment, and hopefully the training and the authority of the law behind them, most people in a D&amp;D world will know you probably shouldn't wander into Land of Rampaging Orcs or go sightseeing at Tarrasque Falls."", ""A good place to start is by obviously not giving the PCs a reason to go there. If they get money, favors, plot advancement, etc. from going to an area fit for their level they're more likely to go there. Obviously not foolproof, but still good. "", 'GM: This is a open world. You can go wherever you want. Zones A, B, C and D are available.\n\nPlayers: What we know about that zones?\n\nGM: Well, if you go to zones B to D you probably die.\n\nPlayers: Ok, we go to zone A.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat´s not a sandbox game, it´s a railroad one disguise in a sandbox form. For me the problem is any system that use hp and level progress together. If you really want to run a sanbox game, you must avoid this two things.']"

Last night I run combat encounter where party fought **20 wolves**. Tracking turns, abilities, health is easy because I use [improved-initiative](https://www.improved-initiative.com/)  


Problem is how to track health foe each enemy on the board with minis ? ( not to mention how it got even tougher when one of the player cast faerie fire )  


How do you do it ?  


( I would like to hear for solutions beyond mark each mini with color. Or put coins with numbers.  That is quite obvious )",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a40hnh/advice_on_how_to_track_health_in_a_game_with_lot/,"['Whenever you plan on running more than 8 or so enemies, consider if it makes sense to have them come in waves.\n\n8 wolves initially. 4 more after turn 1. 4 more after turn 2. The last 4 after that.\n\nAssuming they take a few down each round its just mathematicaly less to deal with. Plus as a DM you have the ultimate say in how many come out per round and how many total, which allows you to dial down or dial up the numbers if the party needs more or pess challenge.\n\nOther than that, id say keep it as clean as possible, and use a subtractive cumulative method so theres the least amount of work to track. For wolves that have 20 hp to start, write down only their new hp beside. Lets say wolf 2 takes 4 and 8 damage. Then wolf 5 takes 13. Cross out or zero dead wolves.\n\nW1 20\nW2 20 16 8\nW3 20\nW4 20\nW5 20 7\nW6 20\nW7 20\nEtc.', 'I\'m not really a fan of hp, and I mostly run Savage Worlds games, tracking initiative with cards, therefore I don\'t know how the app works.\n\nHowever! I would apply a simplified system to track health when you have a lot of minis (but no one of them stand as ""more important"" than the others). Instead of hp, your wolves have Significant Hits (on the app, if you can, sign SH instead of HP). \n\nA Significant Hit is a reasonably high damage that can threaten an enemy, and ranges in fraction of their health. For example, if a wolf has 30 HP, losing 1-2 or even 3 HP (a low roll) poses no real danger, while 4-8 (a normal roll) damage takes a fifth (circa), of his life. Therefore, doing 5 attacks that causes 4 to 8 damage each will kill the wolf. We derive that the life of a wolf is 5 SH. Also doing 3 attack that causes 9 to 14 damage each will be enough, meaning that 9-14 equals to 2 SH.  15-21 equals to 3 SH, and 22-29 4 SH. Simplifing a 6 or similar number is SH, and each multiple a corresponding SH (12 or similar 2, 18 or similar 3, and so on...).\n\nThis is something you decide before the fight, in order to determine how many SH an enemy has, and how much damage a SH is:\n*a wolf has 5 SH and each SH is 6 or similar*\n\nDuring the fight, you discard every roll that is inferior to 6 or similar (you may accept a 5 sometimes), and remove a SH from the wolf, 2 if the damage is 12 (or similar), 3 when 18 or similar, and so on. \n\nYou don\'t have to be consistent, if you are the only one tracking the life of the foes: sometimes you can accept (remove 1 SH) a 4 when they needed a 5, or consider 21 equal to 18 to determine 3 SH instead of 4 SH.\n\nIt might sound unfair, but you players don\'t have to know that their low roll don\'t mean anything in the grand scheme of things. Because this is actually the hard truth: 5 turns of 2 HP damage equals 1 or 2 real, significant damage. You don\'t kill a fericious beast with small papercuts. You find an aperture and strike the fatal blow.\n\n*But small damage over time, like poison or magical fire?*\n\nThe poisoned foe takes a SH once every two or three turns. \n\n*Note: use this system mostly for ""small"" creatures that fight as a pack/group. Your single dragon should use his hp... or you can adapt it for the dragon, granting more SH or increasing the value of each SH*\n\n(Boy I do hope no one realizes that this is a wound system a la Savage)', 'I use labelled paper tokens when its going to be difficult to track.', ""I use a health pool system. Usually it's between 5-20 standard minis with 0-3 special enemies. The standard minis get a total health pool (usually the average hp times the number of minis) and the special ones get tracked separately. Any time the health pool takes enough damage to kill a single enemy, the one attacked dies. It keeps things simple overall, and has tidied up one of the tedious aspects of mass combat."", ""If you are trying to be as accurate as possible, in other words not coming up with alternatives such as grouping, you should go with labeling.  You can also distribute the work and have players track the labels.  Players tend to be very good at tracking positive stats...so have them track the damage dealt to the monsters.\n\nYou can also label in your notepad as it becomes relevant.  For example, if you have 20 identical wolves...but only 3 have been damaged so far.  You only need to track 3 wolves.  Even if you use variable hp, generate the HP when the wolf is damaged.\n\nMy overall solution though is to chunk the wolves in your head and also use them in small groups in the combat.  Basically subdivide the big mob into enemy formations.  It's easier to keep track of, Group 3: Wolf A.  Instead of which one is Wolf L.  Many times in my notepad, the group name is the name of the PC I've decided that group will go after.   Combine this along with the track only when it becomes relevant to ease up the mental labor for yourself."", ""Mark your minis so you can know which one is which. I'm planning to put numbers on the bases for my minis, although I didn't need it yet because I didn't have too big battles since I started using minis."", ""Steal a page from Savage Worlds and use tokens to mark HP, conditions, etc... Just put those tokens right next or under the miniature. Litko makes a whole line of plastic tokens that are great for table top mini's."", 'In mass combat, i find myself either writing how much damage each target took on the mat next to them, or in groups.  \n\n\nI also use tiles that have colored numbers, so I can designate blue 1, blue 2, purple 3, red 4, and can track HP that way.  Labeling your miniatures in a similar way (slip paper under them with a unique identifer can work) can do the same thing.', 'This is a very common problem people come across. You want to have your group face a difficult fight, but you want to zerg them instead of having them fight another really strong ""boss"" type monster. \n\nThe easiest way to ""track hp""? Don\'t use hp as you typically think of it. \n\nTypical hp is for boss type enemies, or at least those that individually pose a little threat without mass numbers. Mooks (aka 20 wolves) do not deserve typical hp. They are fodder for hero fun.\n\nInstead, give each wolf simplified hp. Each has 3 hit points or less (ideally they have only 1hp). Every hit they take of any kind reduces that hp by 1. If you have a heavy-hitter in the party, maybe they do 2 damage instead of 1. \n\nBasically it comes down to this: mooks are meant to die in large numbers so the heroes can kill a ton of them. It makes players feel badass and shows them how far their characters have progressed since beginning the campaign. It\'s a huge tool to use as a DM, but it also requires simplifying the load on you, the DM, as much as possible. ', 'If the problem is keeping track of which wolf has which HP, I\'d put a dice next to each mini, so you have wolf #1, wolf #2, etc. (Note: The logical extreme of this is to get rid of minis altogether and players just fight dice.)\n\nIf the problem is you don\'t want to keep track of 20 different enemy HPs, considering abstracting them into ""wolf packs"", which is flavored as multiple wolves but mechanically a single creature.', 'Use a red marker to draw a line on the mini for each damage it takes.

rpg,t3_a40f19,"Need help with Werewolf 20 damage/healing/regenSo I have been reading Werewolf: The Apocalypse 20th anniversary edition and I am really, really confused by how damage and healing works. The section on healing from the book says this:

&amp;#x200B;

*Healing*

*Werewolves heal at an incredible pace. A Garou regenerates her worst bashing or lethal health level every turn. Homid- and lupus-breed Garou can regenerate a health level each day while in their natural forms if they are in critical condition, but doing so doesn’t let them do much more than sleep. If they’re conscious and moving around in their breed form, they heal as humans do. Metis are blessed with full regeneration in every form.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Garou cannot regenerate aggravated damage with anything like the same speed. A character heals one health level of aggravated damage each day, as long as she spends her time resting in a form that normally regenerates.*

&amp;#x200B;

The second sentence (""A Garou regenerates her worst bashing or lethal health level every turn"") and the 4th sentence (""If they're conscious and moving around in their breed form, they heal as humans do."") directly contradict each other. Garous either heal one bashing/lethal every turn, regardless, or they heal in special ways depending on their form. It can't be both. The paragraph about aggravated damage also has the tag about ""a form that normally regenerates"", lending more weight to the idea of some forms being able to regenerate and others not. But that idea isn't carried through all the book.

&amp;#x200B;

In the earlier sections on damage, the book doesn't say anything about needing to be in a non-breed form to soak bashing or lethal, nor does it say that you need to be in a non-breed form to regenerate this damage.

&amp;#x200B;

In the section about lethal damage, there's some more context. Here's the book text:

*If your character falls to Incapacitated from lethal damage, she can channel her Rage to remain active. If she doesn’t, she falls unconscious and reverts to her breed form. She remains unconscious and regenerates that health level after an eight-hour period. If she takes a level of lethal damage when at Incapacitated, she dies.*

&amp;#x200B;

So when you are incapacitated from lethal damage, you either channel Rage or revert to breed. Once incapacitated in this way, you are unconscious for 8 hours as you regen. I think what the game wants to go for is that after that, you remain unconscious and heal another level for every day of rest (probably 8 hours of sleep, the rest in light activity; or just a full day of unconsciousness as per the healing rules above). If you want to wake up, you have to make a Stamina + Primal Urge check. That would let you shift to a form with different regen rules.

&amp;#x200B;

However, that second sentence in the healing section flies in the face of all of this. I can infer that once you are incapacitated from lethal or aggravated, your regen shuts off until you wake up. But that's not clearly stated at all. And that sentence would mean that once you do wake up, you just start regenerating, regardless of form.

&amp;#x200B;

There's another discrepancy regarding death. Here's the book:

&amp;#x200B;

*Death: If a werewolf is at the Incapacitated health level and takes one more level of lethal or aggravated damage, she dies. A character who dies is removed from the game; the player must create a new character if she wishes to continue play.*

*An incapacitated werewolf may also be killed by massive amounts of bashing trauma — any blow that deals two or more health levels of bashing damage is enough to kill a dying werewolf. This damage overwhelms the Garou’s regenerative capabilities.*

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you are incapacitated and take 2 levels of bashing, you're dead. However, this glosses over the specifics of being incapacitated by different types of damage. That's ok, it's a general vs. specific rule. The problem is later on in the bashing damage section.

&amp;#x200B;

*If your character falls to Incapacitated from bashing damage, she falls unconscious but remains in whatever form she was in. Any additional bashing damage “upgrades” an existing bashing wound to lethal damage. If this additional damage upgrades her Incapacitated health level to lethal damage, she reverts to breed form and may use Rage to remain active (see below). Once she’s Incapacitated with lethal damage, another level of bashing damage kills her.*

&amp;#x200B;

This section says, at the end, that once you are incapacitated with lethal damage, one level of bashing kills you. That's directly contradictory to what was said above.

&amp;#x200B;

So, all that said, here's what I think the game wants. This is all with the note about needing to roll Stamina (diff 8) in stressful situations to regenerate.

**Bashing Damage**

* Soak in any form
* Regenerate one level per turn while conscious in a non-breed form (if metis, in any form)
* Heal as a human in breed form
* if incapacitated, character falls unconscious
   * Additional bashing upgrades to lethal
   * Can roll Stamina + Primal Urge to wake up

**Lethal Damage**

* Soak in a non-breed form
* Regenerate one level per turn while conscious in a non-breed form (if metis, in any form)
* Heal as a human in breed form
* If incapacitated, channel Rage to remain active or fall unconscious in breed form.
   * 2 levels of bashing or 1 level of lethal or aggravated will kill you
   * Regenerate 1 health level every 8 hours, remaining unconscious until fully healed
   * Can roll Stamina + Primal Urge to wake up

**Aggravated Damage**

* Fire, Wyrm-poison, teeth/claws of Garou, supernatural attacks
* If in a non-breed form, silver does aggravated damage. If in breed form, does bashing or lethal as appropriate. Metis take non-soakable aggravated damage from silver in all forms.
* Soak in a non-breed form unless damage from silver. Only soak silver aggravated in breed form (Metis can never soak silver damage).
* Heal one level aggravated damage per day spent resting (8 hrs sleep, other time in light activity) in a non-breed form.
* Heal as a human in breed form. Metis can heal in any form.
* If incapacitated, channel Rage to remain active or die.

Garou only die if ALL of their health track is full of aggravated damage. If the health track is full of lethal damage, additional damage will simply upgrade it to aggravated until the werewolf is dead. \n\nI also believe that you cannot roll Stamina+Primal-Urge to wake up if you have taken lethal damage - my impression was that that rule is only for bashing damage.

rpg,t3_a3yugj,"Marketing a free gameHi everyone,

After the tribulations of r/RPGdesign and quite a few ups and downs over the years, I'd like to present Empire of Ash for your approval.

There's art and we have 5-6 groups playing it right now. After floundering a bit in the marketing department, I managed to find a publisher... that could get us out there by 2021. That's just too far off for how far along we are so we're making a go of it.

**Where we are**

I'd really appreciate it if you'd take a look, it's all formatted and there's art. Old version got a 4/5 on Drivethru and I got compliments from the writers of 13th Age, Honey Heist, and Timewatch. Even got a shoutout from Lindybeige on facebook! It's easy to play on Roll20 because of how Attributes and powers are set up.

I pinned the current version of the full game, character sheets, and wiki on a new sub.

I left out a dedicated 'current events' section so we could put our heads together and build it via a metagame. If you're interested, come check it out just got started on the sub but I'm there daily:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/EmpireofAshGame/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmpireofAshGame/)

It's technically still in beta but overall the game is being met with enough positivity from a small fanbase to really make something out of this. We're a team of two with a ton of content and a good amount of art. Releasing a full size game is tough with a small team but we have the content. Your attention is a valuable commodity and I'd be honored to have it.

**Vanguards**

*Do what they want you to do. You’re the figurine on their war map. Make sure you seem like the type that can be manipulated. Be the bendable, movable doll they want. Be (or seem) poseable. The opposite is disposable.-Advice given to Vanguards*

It's a game where players take the role of Vanguards, agents ""volunteered"" to go toe to toe with insanity in a medieval industrial world. Everything is based on the Late Bronze Age collapse with a bunch of inspiration from the ending of WW1. There's a bunch of options for campaigns and such. Fleshcrafting, Deviants, and immensely powerful Cursed among the enemies. Working for the 'evil empire' (though that title is arguable).

Vanguards are not knights in shining armor. Avoiding conflict or dirty tricks are a necessity. Planning combat or attempting to bring it to a quick conclusion is important. Even the toughest warrior can be killed by a lucky farmer's pitchfork. Vanguards are the expendable assets of a capricious government. If you can navigate unreality of the shattered twilight, warring nations, and agents of the Autocracy, it's possible to restore some sense of normalcy.

They are caught in the middle of a struggle between a totalitarian state that grows less stable every day and the [malignant shards of what is not real](http://empire-of-ash.wikia.com/wiki/Aberrant_Events). If they can navigate the all too human intrigue between supposedly dutiful security services and hold back the growing madness these unsung (and coerced) champions can secure a future for mankind.

**Mechanics**

* 3d6. Three six-sided die are all you need to play.
* Depth of gameplay. Active and Passive attributes govern actions, giving a larger array of options for players and the ability to chain them together for bonuses.
* Scenes and Attributes: One Passive can be rolled at any time in every scene.  Do you keep your score for assurance or gamble to get a higher roll?
* Circumstance. Use role playing to your advantage, there are solid mechanical benefits to clever players that fit any occasion. Blind the enemy, give social proof to your party's charmer, or boost a teammate.
* Cooperation. Helping other players will give a bonus to the helper. No one is useless.
* Vanguards. Players are given a plethora of options, sign a contract to get a limited power over probability or receive bizarre powers by utilizing the boons from the Misanthropic Principle.

I'll have to take a closer look at the game later.\n\nOne thing to think about when you're releasing the game is how Stars Without Numbers and all of the Sine Nomine Games do things with a free version of the game. They always have a basic version that's free that has everything you need to play the basic game, then a paid version that includes extra stuff that you can add to the campaign. If you do don't do one of those no art or eye bleed versions to try to force people to buy the paid version, it will just annoy people and they won't play your game. If the free PDF is nice they'll think well now I wanna see what comes with the paid version.\n\nAlso not a bad idea to get one of those groups you have doing a podcast, Twitch stream, or YouTube video of the game being played. Blades in the Dark did beta playtesting on a Twitch stream/YouTube videos and it did a lot to help build popularity and generate interest for the final version. It's a lot easier for people to decide if they want to play a game if they see a bunch of other people having fun with it.

Also, since you\'re aligning all page numbers to the right, I\'d suggest using tabular figures so they align nicely (this is partially a matter of preference, but it\'d look better)\n\n* Consider adding a bit of shade on the background graphic. As is, it makes certain parts of the text hard to read.\n\n* pg 4. under section ""Cursed"" the first paragraph is doubly indented. I\'m assuming this is a typo.\n\n* Speaking of indentation, the typographic convention is that you either separate paragraphs by a vertical space, or you use an indent... NOT both. \n\n* If you use indentation, it\'s rarely necessary to indent the first paragraph (not a big deal though)\n\n* Be consistent in your design. I noticed that sometimes you include the bold headings with a colon at the end, and the new paragraph is in a new line; but sometimes the paragraph continues in the same line after the heading. I\'m not sure there\'s a reason for that.\n\nHope this helps :)', 'Have You tried getting people like JP or Steve Lumpkin to feature this in one of their shows?', 'You want people to be able to spark interest with as little effort on their part as possible, because we\'re lazy and busy and fickle and we\'re browsing this sub at work.\n\nI backed the Unity RPG on kickstarter and I remember exactly how it got my interest.

What really hooked me though, was that there was a PDF I could click on (people don\'t want to download stuff or go through multiple clicks or logins) that showed in 1 page, well laid out, an example of combat. This allowed me to become interested in the mechanics without having to actually read and learn them like I would if I was already committed to learning the game.\n\nSo your mechanics sound interesting and I want to know more, but make it really really really easy for me to see what sets them apart and whether they\'re right for me. Build a staircase of mounting interest and effort. The lowest step is a piece of artwork that shows that this is a gritty flavor of RPG. The next is a comparison to an existing RPG.

It can also serve as your platform for communication if you are moving towards a commercial release.\n\nGood luck! At a quick glance, the PDF looks good.

rpg,t3_a3yx8o,"System for (somewhat) Supers in a Medieval Fantasy SettingI always wanted a game mostly set in a Medieval Fantasy world where PCs and some Main Villains got some kind of magical super powers, **but are still mortals**.

Some somewhat relevant examples :

* Princess Elsa of Arendelle from Disney's Frozen; she has some neat super-power like abilities (including creating golems and kingdom-wide snow storms), but could be killed by a single crossbow dart or a sword.
* Princess Rapunzel of Corona from Disney's Tangled; another Disney example here, with over-the-top healing powers. Also easily subdued.
* She-Ra from Netflix's She-Ra and the Princesses of Power; or maybe the Original She-Ra as well. She has great physical power and quite a few magical abilities, albeit Etheria is way more sci-fantasy. She could take down small armies but was defeated a few times by lesser foes with better planning.
* Also basically most female character from the Netflix version of She-Ra.
* Marvel's 1602 series; this is cheating, but Marvel Comics did super-heroes in the 17th Century, and they are kinda mortal (X-Men are in there, and guess who doesn't make it?).
* Superman: Kal, from DC Comics; basically Superman in Arthurian England. Not exactly what I want, since Superman is the opposite of ""Mortal"", albeit it's quite close. Other notable DC Comics examples are League of Justice, JLA: Riddle of the Beast, and Batman: Dark Knight of the Round Table.

The closest thing from this I've played was AD&amp;D2e's Birthright, where PCs have some special bloodline powers but can still be easily killed by a well placed attack from a mundane foe.

The main plot for my game would be PCs being ""cursed/blessed"" with such powers, and having to deal with an evil empire (which also has some supers of its own) that is basically conquering everything. PCs may have their own kingdoms to take care of, but are far from gods and are dealing with overwhelming odds against them.

rpg,t3_a3y629,"Army vs army problemI'm currently running a game of Open Legend in the setting of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. They went to Falkreath and offered themselves as mercenaries to the legate of the Imperial army. Their company currently has 11 soldiers, but they can get more soon (for now around 50-ish). I want to do something with these soldiers in the form of a battle were it's Stormcloaks vs Imperials, but Open Legends combat system isn't really made for that. Another problem I think I might run into is that 1 player (the commander of the mercenary company) as to do a lot bc he has to run the army while the other players sort-off do nothing. 

Do you guys have any ideas and suggestions on how I can go about this, maybe there is a system I can borrow from for these kinds of battles.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3y629/army_vs_army_problem/,"['Abstract the battles. Stat up each side as a character, using the basics of composition to decide on stats. So maybe each fighter is 1hp, they are all armed with a spear and shield, so you give damage and defence based on that. Then you play out a fight using those characters, with turns taking longer (on the order of minutes).\n\nGive the players options to help certain actions which will give a boost to their side. For example, maybe the players want to storm the gate. So you play out a small fight for that (or do a skill challenge if that seems too detailed). If the players succeed, then they have taken the gate, which is a bonus to their side.\n\nAlternatively, you can abstract players even more. Decide if they want to take a risky action, a safe one, or a cowardly one. They say what they will be doing and then make a roll at a different threshold for each of those (obviously a risky one being more difficult). If the player succeeds, then the next roll is made with a bonus, which again depends on the type of task. A failure means that they take some sort of injury (which depends on your system, I guess). A cowardly action will reduce the chance of injury, but will negatively affect morale (even if they succeed).\n\nExamples of different actions:\n\n* Storm the gates (risky)\n* Engage an enemy captain (risky)\n* Command your archers (safe)\n* Lead a flanking action (safe?)\n* Rally the frontline (risky?)\n* Stay back and shout commands (cowardly)\n* Cast long distance magics (safe)\n\nMight be something workable there.', 'D&amp;D has attempted to tackle mass combat a few times. You might want to get your hands on the ""Heroes of Battle"" tome, which has guidelines for military campaigns. 4e treated mass combat as a series of skill challenges and small skirmishes. A friend of mine ran an epic-level one shot under 4e and the 4e approach worked pretty well for our group\'s playstyle. And finally, if the Unearthed Arcana page has rules for mass combat.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that the PCs are the heroes of the story. Their successes or failures should have marked effect on the outcome of the battle. If you want your players merely to be swept along in the tide of battle, you might be better off just throwing waves of low-level mooks at them and seeing how long they hold out.', 'Depending on the size and danger of the battle roll a number of d6,for each dice:\n\n* 1: A dead ally\n* 2: A wounded ally\n* 3 and 4: Nothing\n* 5: A wounded ennemi\n* 6: A dead ennemi\n\nThe party with generic advantages such as numbers, position, training and equipment get a number of rerolls.\n\nFor more out there stuff like magic or what not then 3 and 4 can have effects.\n\nE: Do this every round.', 'You basically have to make this into a ""skill challenge"" -- decide what would happen if the PCs weren\'t involved in the battle at all, and then allow each player a few chances to do something to influence the tide of the battle.   Generally, I would AVOID engaging the actual combat system because that tends to take a long time relative to other types of actions, and unless they\'re fighting an enemy champion or something, the results should probably just be ""Okay, you kill one soldier, big deal, moving on.""\n\nThis definitely counts as Advanced GMing in my book, because it\'s almost always heavily improvised.', 'Break the army up into squads with players each leading a small group and abstract the player into the group as a whole.

They roll as they would and army follows their lead. Outnumbering the enemy? Get a hit and damage modifier. Equal fight? Just do a regular roll for each side and whoever gets damaged more rolls for casualties. Either that, or roll for casualties on every critical.\n\nAlso I would make those ""soldier"" that each player commands an extra skill set. This way once per turn player can get unstuck (free from a trap, or whatever) by his comrades, or can order his flock to charge/fall so that he can do whatever else when the enemy is distracted.\n\nIn general this is something you need to make up rules for.

What are they actually doing and what do they expect, when they don't involve themselves with this mercenary army?\n\nMaybe they are interested and it is just not enough to do. So write a list of all the commando tasks you can find in a mercenary company. Then write a job name besides every task (i.e. quartermaster). After that is done, assign these jobs to your players. Now that you have a list of tasks for each job, it should be easy to come up with lots and lots of skill challenges to keep them busy."", ""GURPS has an expansion about mass combat, and there's an article about leadership mechanics in SJG's Pyramid.\n\nThere's a huge amount of rules involved with these though, so I would only bother with them if the whole campaign is going to be mass combat oriented."", 'I usually do mass combat narratively, rather than wargam-y, unless my players really want to geek out on the tactics/strategy.  \n\nBy this, I mean that I take all the inputs (side strengths, morale, equipment, key planning decisions, terrain, etc) and come up with a general narrative, like I would with any other story.  Then I turn the PCs loose and see what they do to change that story (or completely rewrite it, as PCs are wont to do!).\n\nThis way the PC general does have some input on the, well, inputs to the battle, but it leaves the emphasis on the PC party running around doing heroic stuff that affects the outcome of the battle.

Feel free to contribute, I will probably add some more pattern in the future.

If you want to collaborate you might be better just starting with a plain text document in google docs, that people can comment on, rather than a PDF.', 'If anybody is confused, Design Patterns are constructs often used within software engineering that describe commonly acceptable solutions for particular problems as well as providing a common language that engineers can use when discussing software engineering problems.\n\nOne example of a design pattern is called the Strategy pattern. The Strategy pattern solves the problem of choosing an algorthm at run-time (on the fly if you will) while making the rest of the code agnostic to how the algorithm actually works.\n\nFor example, let\'s say part of my application needs to send a security code to a user if they do a password reset. Your code might look something along the lines of:\n\n```\npreferences = getUserPreferences()\nresetStrategy = lookupResetStrategy(preferences)\nresetStrategy.sendResetCode()\n```\n\nBased on my preferences I might want the code texted to my cell phone, I might want an email sent to my primary account, or I might want a circus clown in a clown car to deliver the code to me personally to my home address. The algorithm for doing each of these things is different, but the rest of the application doesn\'t care. It just wants to send the reset code by whatever method the user chooses. This being the case my `lookupResetStrategy` part of the code is going to examine the user\'s preferences and based on those return a specific strategy. Each strategy implementation has that `sendResetCode()` bit implemented in a different way. For example:\n\n```\nSendEmailResetStrategy\n-sendResetCode() : send an email to the user\n\nSMSResetStrategy\n-sendResetCode() : send a text message to the user\n\nClownCarResetStrategy\n-sendResetCode() : send reset code to nearest circus clown, send clown to user\'s address\n```\n\nNow engineers will simply say to each other something along the lines of ""we should probably just use strategy for handling the sending of the reset code."" The engineers instantly have an idea of how to solve the problem.\n\nIn RPGs, the _Five Room Dungeon_ pattern would be an example of a GM adventure creation design pattern. _No, but..._ would be an example of a GM behavioral pattern. As we can see, these patterns already exist but any effort to formalize and catelog them is certainly admirable.\n', ""Very interesting! I've been trying to write a pattern language for dungeon design for a while now, based on Christopher Alexander's work.\n\nI strongly disagree with some of the design patterns, though.

If they chose something, don`t try to railroad them towards what you want. If they want to split the group, let them! A group split in two is the perfect setup to apply pacing techniques.', ""If you don't mind me asking what is your primary language?

rpg,t3_a3wv5z,"Have you tried ""interview"" sessions for people to join your group? How did it go?I'm thinking about trying out individual one-shot sessions as ""interviews"" to see if the person fit my style of GMing and the general tone of the game. Any tips?

For the one-shot itself, I was thinking about having them use a pre-gen character, who has to get to the ""guild"" that their real character will be in, and tell them a message to kick off the actual campaign.

But maybe getting a beer together before playing, or having the new guy come and check a game session to see if the style fits it's all right."", ""One-shots with potential players is a solid idea, though some problems only rear up with time. Even so, it's a good place for you to lay out expectations as DM.  You might want to design the one shot to include a tough combat. See how they react when a fight gets stressful.  Include a social encounter - do they try to interact, or do they sit back or get impatient?  Limits on how much you can do in a one shot of course, so focus on what is important to you.  "", ""This is what i always do, and it works wonders for me. Mostly for potential players that haven't roleplayed ever, but it's good for people who come from another system too, and for people new to the table. We focus heavily on roleplaying, so it's a way for them to figure out if they'll like our style too. \nFor my one-shot, I make them play as theirself, and make them go through some crazy situations, it's all scripted and on rails, but you get to see how involved they get and such things, you should try it"", ""I send prospective players my Session Zero packet, which covers expectations, campaign premise, character building guide, house rules, etc, and I'll even do Q&amp;A if the player has any questions.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't devote a special session just for that one player.

I always interview, but I haven\'t tried an interview one-shot yet.  \n\n\nAs an aside, I don\'t agree with the comments that say interviewing is pretentious. RPGs don\'t work when the wrong GM matches with the wrong players. Every game I run has a certain tone in mind, so I want players who ""get"" what I\'m going for. I also want to know what the players want out of my game, so I can plan accordingly.   \n', 'I\'ve found interviews to be necessary to my ability to enjoy gaming but don\'t do them one on one. And for that matter don\'t let on that this is some kind of audition for anything. \n\nMy method: Get a group of 5-6 prospective randoms together for a one shot. Complete the one shot and take note of who you gel with and who you don\'t. If you only gel with 2-3 of the prospective players then invite them back for the next game you run. Repeat process until you have 4-5 stable players who are all on the same page. \n\nLet them make their own characters, I find looking at what players prioritize while building tells me a lot about how they\'ll play the game. This isn\'t a knock against min-maxing mind you, it\'s just more to gauge preference. High Op characters tell me this player likes to feel competent in their role for example. Also having rules about character creation helps me figure out who\'s good at following direction. \n\nI say don\'t let on it\'s an ""interview"" because people will adjust their behavior if they know they\'re trying out for something. You want a clear idea of how they\'ll play in the long term, not how they\'ll play when they\'re trying to impress you and/or on their best behavior. ', 'I did not. But wow, given the horror stories I experienced trying to find good gaming groups, in the 1990s, I sure wish I had. It is like blind dating. I think it’s a great idea. And honestly?

I gmed a vampire:the masquerade campaign for a hot second a while back and they have individual pre sessions, typically where the pc gets turned into a vampire. Theses individual sessions I tried to make as close to the tone of the overall sessions. Those sessions were weird intense and intimate. I also gm lots of seventh sea and that has a 20 questions section for players to answer which helps pick up plot hooks related to that character and define certain personality traits. The 20 questions section has really helped develop characters for players who don’t really role play and now I use it as a stand in if a system doesn’t have some means of defining personality for a character. I also try to be with my players when they make characters, at least over a chat service, because I know them and how much to trust them. ', 'I use ""interview"" sessions both for online and offline games.  I think it\'s very useful to use these especially if you have an ongoing game that you are bringing a new person into who may be unfamiliar with both the game and the other players.\n\nIf anything the one-shot introductory session is a favor to the new player because there\'s no campaign baggage.  It saves them from the ""overhelpful"" veteran players.  I\'m sure anyone who has run games long enough knows this horror story.  They have a new prospective player.   They bring them into the existing game.  Other players start quarterbacking them and info-dumping the new player ruining their first experience.  Also they have to build a level 5 character without any context of how the game works.  Utter Nightmare scenario.\n\nOverall though my preferred method has been to just align the new players first session with the first session of a new campaign arc.  But I can see that this wouldn\'t work if I was still running very long campaigns as opposed to shorter 12-16 session campaigns.', 'Interviews are way too pretentious for game night imo. When you have a potential group why not just run a one shot for everyone and you can see if they work well together? You may like someone, but they may not click with the entire table. Then if they get along and youre content to run for the group still actually make a more substantial commitment.\n\nBasically - go on dates not job interviews.', 'my group and i have talked about doing this if we for some reason decided that we wanted more players. we currently are not in the market for more players though, and have not ever really been in the market for new players, so it is not something we have ever actually done. \n\nwe had some interview-esque stuff when i joined, in a roundabout way, but moreso training and study instead of an interview. we did huge amounts of freeform together to get me up to speed and on the same page about practices and everything as the rest of the group before i ever played at the table.']"
rpg,t3_a3wmui,"GM Tips to Live ByI find that a lot of newbie GMs come here looking for advice. So here's my two cents (stolen from an old post over at [paizo.com](https://paizo.com))

 

TIP 1: Generally speaking try to stick to the rules. The rules of Dnd/Pathfinder/whatever game you're playing have been play-tested for months/years/decades. Chances are if you give them a chance you'll find them a really good template for a good game. Most groups - however - find that they do some things differently, which brings us to ...

TIP 2: HAVE A LIST OF HOUSE-RULES. Nearly every group does something that isn't in the rules. It's a good idea to try to have these in a list so people can look at them and access them easily (give everyone a copy, either on paper or a digital copy so that they can refer to it when they need to). Generally speaking this will be the GM's list, but it's a good idea to sit down together before you start playing and talk to the players about which rules they do/don't like. Maybe they'll come up with another rule that you can add into the game. Again this is a group game, so any rule that helps everyone enjoy the experience is a good rule.

TIP 3: DON'T ARGUE DURING THE GAME. It's inevitable that something will come up that the rules (and your house-rules) haven't covered. Or that could be interpreted different ways. Or that one person is just straight up wrong about. If this happens, you can call someone on it, but if it takes longer than about 10 seconds to resolve the dispute, ask the GM to make a snap decision. This decision will be binding for the rest of the session, but you can talk about it after the game has wrapped up and decide as a group how you'd like to handle this ""rule"" for future games (and add any new rules to your list for people to refference).",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3wmui/gm_tips_to_live_by/,"[""Chris Perkins’ DM Survival Tips. I believe these were from a podcast circa 2008ish. I find them a good set of quick touchstones:\n \n1. When in doubt, wing it.\n\n2. Keep the story moving. Go with the flow.\n\n3. Sometimes things make the best characters.\n\n4. Always give players lots of things to do.\n\n5. Wherever possible, say ‘yes.’\n\n6. Cheating is largely unnecessary.\n\n7. Don't be afraid to give the characters a fun new toy.\n\n8. Don't get in the way of a good players exchange.\n\n9. Avoid talking too much.\n\n10. Save some details for later.\n\n11.

Some DMs here seem to think they have to train players or act like every game session is serious acting. Neither is true. This is a group of friends coming together to have a good time. While that can be subjective, it pays to remember the whole point is to relax and play a game.

rpg,t3_a3whpt,"Backstory Writing TipsI have a bad habit of immediately going with something like ""My family was murdered"" and I wish I could be more creative. What kind of stuff do you guys do when you write backstories?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3whpt/backstory_writing_tips/,"['Build connections. \n\n* Isolating your PC from everything and everyone is easy and ""safe"", but it\'s cheap and ultimately not much fun. You *want* your character to be connected to the world via family, friends, enemies, and favors owed and earned. \n\nGive them something they want... \n\n* Give your character something they\'ll chase after because they desire to. It might be a physical thing (""I must recover my family\'s heirloom sword""), or a person (""my brother is out there, somewhere. I\'ll find him.""), or even an abstract concept (""all my life, I\'ve longed to belong somewhere""). Make it something important enough to them that they\'ll go after it, even if it\'s risky or dangerous.\n\n...and something they need.\n\n * Maybe it\'s something they know they need, maybe it isn\'t. Again, it might be physical, but it may also be emotional or conceptual. Make it threatening, but not immediately dangerous; it\'s a looming hunger, always in the backs of their minds, whispering dark things in their ears.\n\nKnow what they fear, hate, regret, and have failed at.\n\n* Characters are interesting because of their flaws and weaknesses. Pick a vice, something your character knows is self-destructive but that they can\'t help but indulge. Pick something they\'re afraid of, and figure out why. Pick their greatest shame; the most important thing (in their mind) that they\'ve failed to do or get or earn. Again, this could be a task (""my best friend died because I couldn\'t protect him from those goblins""), a circumstance (""I wasn\'t there there day my order was wiped out, and I\'ll never forgive myself""), or even a belief (""no matter what I did, I could never make my father love me"").\n\nBut most importantly, leave blanks.\n\n* A comprehensive backstory may be interesting, but it also isn\'t very useful. Instead, summarize and highlight, leaving enough space between the details to fill in later. Have an idea, an outline, of what happened and why, but leave the close examination to be done during play. It\'s MUCH more interesting when everyone at the table discovers these things together.\n\n', 'I focus on 3 things - Background, Motivation, and Personality.\n\nFor background, I really don’t go into any detail beyond previous occupation and significant relationships. Usually there is one big event tied to their motivation, but I figure that stories about their past will be more interesting and fit better if I decide and tell them in character as they come up.\n\nMotivation could also be called Goals. Why is the character adventuring? This one I consider the most important because it determines the stakes the character has. For example, my character in a game I’m in right now is trying to get his wife back from his warlock patron, who kidnapped her to coerce him into doing a few specific tasks. Ultimately he wants to just get his wife and retire, and he doesn’t really care about the impending apocalypse. If he gets his wife before that gets fixed, he’s gonna just go back home and be a locksmith like he used to be.\n\nPersonality is the aspect I put the most effort into. I usually pick a couple major values that help guide their decisions, then think of some likes/dislikes, habits, and mannerisms. Then I figure out why they think/behave that way. It usually goes back and forth a few times, and usually they character winds up pretty different once I start playing them. Planning it out is mainly a starting point from which the character develops.\n\n\nTL:DR, the main things I try and figure out are what they do and why they do it, with a few iterations for good measure.', 'Dont write one. Discover the PC as you go. Or if you *must* write a ""backstory"" make it fit within the confines of a magic mouth spell. \n\nYep, I know its an unpopular opinion. But its mine. no one has to like it. \n', ""The background is one of the ways of expressing what you want the story of your character to be about. What it does is giving you a reference for portraying the character and giving your GM hooks to build on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn general, I try to create backgrounds that contain elements such as:\n\n* Relations with other PCs and with NPCs that I may explore in play. One or two, typically. They should be people I can interact with regularly; a friend, mentor or family member who is far away doesn't count.\n* Something to motivate my character. A belief, a value or a goal to pursue. It needs not be a main goal for the whole campaign; rather something that drives and shapes the character's choices.\n* Something that hurt my character or something they ran away from. A horrible event, a secret, a responsibility they didn't want to take. That's an emotional problem they need to overcome and the central theme for their evolution. \n* Something to kick my character into action. A short-term goal or a sudden problem they need to overcome. It may be something that won't matter in the long run, but it gives something to do (and to pull others characters into) during the first session."", 'Think about ongoing conflicts and how it can be tied into the active game.  Backstories are boring and kinda useless when they are entirely wrapped up in the backstory.  This is sort of why I encourage players to hold off on backstories until we start playing.   I think having the context of playing and what\'s going on can help with fleshing out a character.  Also I find that the party tends to care more about each other when the backstory comes out naturally over time just like in a normal story.  Rarely do you read a story where a character will suddenly stand straight up and state their backstory from birth to current time.\n\nHere\'s a couple ways to approach backstory in a retroactive fashion.  This will involve some negotiation with the GM of course as you figure out what\'s ""reasonable.""  It can help to talk with the GM ahead of time so they know you\'ll be doing this if it\'s not their usual method.\n\nPick something in the game you are playing.  Such as NPC/Place/Object.  Come up with a backstory element and connect it to that thing.  Now not only are you developing your backstory in a way that the other players will listen, but you help create active links to the game.  GM will judge and offer adjustments if the idea is too small or way out there.  So instead of ""My Family was murdered"".   It is now  ""My family was murdered at (Town Name) and just so happens that\'s where we\'re headed.  I think we need to spend a little more time there asking around about these disappearances""\n\nCome up with a session objective that helps reveal more about your character.  What is it you will attempt to accomplish this session?  A goal oriented approach can help you build your character\'s backstory and current story bit by bit rather than trying to create a fully detailed character right off the start.  Again, this not only helps you make a complex character, but others will care about who your character is because you are actually making your story an active part of the game.    ""My family was murdered"" becomes  ""This session I will try to find a lead who knows about the massacre.""\n\nThis method doesn\'t work with all players, but for me as both GM and Player it works wonders.  I find that I have an easier time and just more fun discovering more about my character session to session.  And from the GM perspective, it\'s just a lot easier to integrate your background into the game when it\'s actually built with parts of the game.  With frontloaded backstories, it can be very difficult and they are often ""selfishly"" written backstories making it hard to integrate the party.', 'Some people already did exhaustive list and stuff that seem cool so to save a long comment, I’ll be to the point. Don’t write a character who’s already had one of the most important things that will ever happen to them happen. That just takes the opportunity for you and the gm to do it at the table. Give you’re character something to do, some thing to chase, or work toward. I hate inventing something for my players to work toward. I’ve seen so many dead parents at the table with me both gming/playing and I’m sick of it because half the time they don’t even have names behind this loss. Try to have unresolved things things in your backstory. Personality is more important than having a fuck ton of things that have happened. ', 'Some games have pretty cool built in backstory or ""Life Path"" generators for characters, the new ""Witcher"" rpg by R. Talsorian is a good example of this. But usually I just tend to give my characters A. A habit or hobby that sets him apart when I RP, B. A general backstory of where he\'s from and why he (or she) is doing XYZ with the group, C. Something weird or strange or interesting about their life. And that\'s about it. I might make a Blacksmith who likes to craft tiny spoons and comes from a family of illiterate sheepherders who have exiled him for learning to read. Or whatever else.', 'I guess I try to get as much information about the setting and type of game that I can and write what would make sense and give them a reason to explore.  \n\n\nI played the same Swordmage for two different 4e games. In the megadungeon crawl, his wife had died and he was going into the dungeon because he was led to believe that he would be able to bring her back if he made it to the bottom. Same character in a game about a huge war, he asked to join the irregular forces because of his skills and joined to keep his wife and family safe.  I guess the point of this example is to try and make the backstory fit and give them a reason to pursue whatever the main goal of the campaign is.', 'I once noticed that same murdered parents theme in my group and actively started going against it. I figure out who the characters parents were and how he ended up being whatever class. It helps form what kind of childhood he had and how he may interact with certain PCs, NPCs, or parts of the setting. ', ""Most important tip I've found? 3-4 'mysteries'. They don't have to be big, just write into it things your character doesn't know. Why was the family killed? Who by? Why was your character spared?\n\nThis is important as it gives the GM wiggle room to incorporate your story into the plot, rather than the other way around. If baron Snorville killed your family, the GM has to include baron Snorville. If an unknown armored figure did it, the GM can reveal down the line it was the son of the BBEG trying to prove himself to his father."", ""When writing remember that you don't need to make a whole page or paragraph of stuff if you don't want to.\n\nYou can keep it thourough enough with a simple bullet point and a few words to make an associatian.\n\nFi Tor\n\n* Hear the Lamentations\n\n* Always looking for a fight\n\n* Conan the Barbarian but blonde\n\nThat kind of thing, and if eventually you want to flesh it out, you can always write more."", ""Throw out some Tarot cards and guess wildly. Extrapolate from your skill list. Be vague as you like. As mentioned, try to offer up some links with other characters.\n\nFlip it around? Someone else's family was murdered and you adopted the sole survivor, now you're on a quest to bring the killers to justice.""]"
rpg,t3_a3wfp2,"Is there a difference between American and European priorities for RPG art and graphic design?I'm kinda interested if this is a pattern other people see or if it is just me. As I have bought books over the years, and though there are exceptions to every rule, it has always seemed like RPGs coming out of Europe put a bigger emphasis on having quality art, layouts, and even just more consistency in the overall aesthetic of a book or game line. The mega companies WotC, Paizo, and Fantasy Flight all do this well, but once you step down to the level of say Onyxpath, Monte Cook Games, and Green Ronin there seems to be different priorities when it comes to art than their European counterparts like Modiphius (not to mention the publishers like Jarnringen or Free League that have teamed up with them in the last few years) or Cubicle 7. If I'm not just imagining it what accounts for this difference, is it something their market demands more? or maybe its just their developers feel art needs more focus? or is pulling great art together easier or cheaper for them?

As a side note I don't want to seem like I am shitting on Onyxpath, Monte Cook Games, and Green Ronin, a lot of the art in their books is genuinely great, but as a whole it just doesn't seem to me that they rise to the quality of their best stuff all throughout their books.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3wfp2/is_there_a_difference_between_american_and/,"[""When I worked at a game distribution warehouse I came to notice that in general, European produced rpg's and tabletop games had the most overall polish.  from things like better binding, to more expensive paper stock, to heavier box cardboard it just seemed like euro game companies took production quality and presentation very seriously.

rpg,t3_a3tmht,"[Update] I started a DnD club in my school. Someone's character died in the first encounter.I posted here a couple of weeks ago about starting a new club in my school and that I was a little worried about DMing for the first time. We are running the Lost Mines of Phandelver starter set.

I listened to as much advice as I could. I searched a lot of online resources and came up with some fun rules. I rolled in the open so that the students could see the outcome.

Bad news: a character died during the opening encounter.

If you haven't played the campaign, there's an encounter right at the start involving goblins. I decided to use a fairly straightforward battle system for the first go and we'd discuss the actual rules for rolling in the next meeting.

Everything was going well until I rolled very well and one kid rolled very not. The halfling rogue took some big hits and was at 1 hp with one goblin left.

I decided now would be a good time to add some spice. The goblin offered a game of chance: I roll a d6 and the goblin attacks whichever character the die picks. Each character was assigned a number and the rogue was second in line.

I guess you know where this is going.

I rolled a 2 and the kid was just dumbfounded. He took an arrow to the face and died.

Now, I'm not heartless. The wording in the manual says that if the party is incapacitated, that they can wake up and find they've been looted but left alive. I read it in such a manner that it leaves room for it to apply to single characters. He'll wake up after the battle having only lost the healing potion I gave them all to start off with.

I did spend the afternoon ragging on him for it. We called him Pincushion for the rest of the day.

The kids all loved it. They were totally into the battle, strategizing how to move their characters and how best to handle the attackers. And you have never seen a more focused group of students than when I rolled that d6.

It all turned out well and they're all very excited for the next meeting. Thank you everyone who offered advice or words of support.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3tmht/update_i_started_a_dnd_club_in_my_school_someones/,"['Um.....when they hit 0, they don’t die.

This year the wild card was actually not all that wild, DnD5e, which we just played for a very classic game to shake things up as we've been doing some weird campaign styles.  My preference for a system is that it has simple mechanics, but still in the realm of tactical combat/play as opposed to narrative system games.  The system also needs to be easily modify it to fit custom settings without driving me nuts with prep."", ""(GM) we're playing pathfinder because I didn't want to have the fight to get them to play another system.

I single-handedly killed it.  One of the players asked to take over GM duties after Runelords.  I was asked if I would want to play.  I inquired about the system.  Sadly, I cannot give you the name of the system.  Hero-something or Rune-something.\n\nWhat I *do* know is that I heard how the system works and bluntly said no thanks.  The system was like a 5th edition D&amp;D game with the GM having even MORE control, and the rules being even MORE fast &amp; loose.  The GM would make the characters and hand them out to players.  The players wouldn\'t even know about spells/powers/feats available upon level up.  Instead, you would negotiate with the GM to learn about things that sounded good, and if approved, get something.\n\nSo the GM made the world, the GM made the characters, the GM decided if/what you could learn as you gained power.  The players, it seemed, were mostly irrelevant and at the mercy of the GM.  AND the guy who wanted to be GM... had *exactly* the kind of personality that would enjoy a rule set intended to make only the GM happy.  I said something like, ""So the players don\'t do anything but show up and say \'Please GM may I have a boon?\'  No thanks.  I don\'t even want to waste my time on a single game day of that.""\n\nWhen I said that, I saw that I had instantly killed it for everyone else in the room.  I don\'t know if they were thinking the same thing and they were grateful that I was blunt enough to say it, or maybe they were excited to play but when I hated on it so hard it just soured everyone on it.  What I do know is that the guy who wanted to be GM dropped it after that.\n\nTo be fair, I *did* say they should play it without me.  I said I\'d love a break from our game nights and they should not allow my opinion to stop the rest of them.  But it was maybe too late.\n\nAnd I know that the game system is popular.  I don\'t recall the name but it\'s not like the made-by-a-single-dude-as-a-hobby-project thing.  It\'s from a real company and it has lots of players.  I guess people like it.

So we've agreed to give online play a try (the Pendragon group I'm in meets online and it's worked out very well for me). I showed the players the big list of games I'm interested in running, they each picked their top three, and we went with the one game all players' lists had in common, The One Ring."", ""I currently play in a campaign. It's set in a homebrew fantasy world and runs on Fate engine. Our current GM (my wife) had a fun idea for a game, she pitched it to the group and we were interested.

And, after 13 sessions, I'm sure it's a good fit foe this game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also run short adventures for my work colleagues, two sessions each. The group is mostly complete newbies and the people who are not have only narrow experience in terms of different games. Because of that, I run each adventure in a different game, trying to cover a wide range of different styles - so that later they may decide what their preferences are, knowing what they can choose from. We played Mouse Guard, Dogs in the Vineyard, Strike and now Nobilis. We'll probably try two or three more games, including something GM-less and something from the PbtA family."", ""As GM I decide on a game I'm passionate to try out and bring it to the players.

We just don't do one-shots because that's not the one player's vibe, but commit to short to mid-length campaigns."", ""For my group, when we started, 5e wasn't out yet (otherwise I would've started them on it), so we started with Pathfinder, since I was familar with 3.5.  For the most part, it stuck, although even after years, I'm still teaching/reminding them of many mechanics.\n\nWe've also delved into other systems, like Shadowrun (which they had a blast, even being *completely clueless about the system*) and Cypher (didn't click, nobody cared for it).  If I ever get a chance, I might run Rhapsody of Blood for them at some point, but I gotta wrap my head about PtbA stuff better first."", 'I DM 2e because I\'m a cheap bastard and don\'t want to buy a ton more books just to play a newer version when 2e works just fine.

rpg,t3_a3taj8,"Newish GM, what is the best way to develop and keep a story flowing when it is narrative focused?HellO!

Okay, so I am newish to GMing. I have run a few campaigns in the past but it was mostly with action focused RPs with systems that had and allowed for that sort of thing. My experience was mostly with D&amp;D and Warhammer Fantasy 2E. 

This time around, I am developing a story heavy game set in the World of Darkness. I am planning for the opening arc to be a Mystery type thing where the players discover a horrible thing happening in the town and a conspiracy, and several underground organizations. Something where the players interactions and development while solving everything takes priority. 

As the WoD encourages solo sessions if need be to set things up and lead to development, I tried with one of my players, also to get a better handle on the actual game system that way as well. Little test ran for about an hour, and during it I felt like it was still fairly action focused compared to what I actually wanted. 

So I was wondering what are some good advice for keeping everything flowing and on track with less action. To set up characters and NPCs for the players to interact with instead of just attacking. To sorta... I don't know, give the world a little more depth. The fighting made sense in the prelude as the PC I was playing with, his character was a night guard down at the docks, so that fit in with his character getting involved. Still though, I don't know. 

I just really want to make this chronicle the best possable one I've done and I have so many ideas. Just not sure of the best way to keep it on track and to develop things in the roleplaying focused direction instead of action focused. Stuff like descriptors, giving the players things without giving away too much, etc etc etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3taj8/newish_gm_what_is_the_best_way_to_develop_and/,"[""One big problem with mystery games is that players can't figure out what's going on and spin their wheels. In order to deal with that have the bad guys be more active. If the PCs start stumbling around incompetently have them try to shut the PCs down to keep the mystery hidden. That way the PCs get more clues in the form of figuring out who's obstructing them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust look at the basic pattern of any Dresden novel."", 'Welcome to the wonderful World of Darkness!  I\'m going to focus on your questions about adding depth and making NPCs.\n\nMy advice is to start asking questions. Get nosy. Get *really* nosy.\n\nStart with the player characters. Ask the players what their character\'s life is like, who their friends and family are and what\'s important to them. Then you can start using that information to flavor the game. Start with little things. After an investigation scene, the player gets a text from their wife asking if they\'re going to be working late again. Make their lives feel real.\n\nCreating plot NPCs is the same. Start with the practical stuff: What do they know, who are they working for, what can the PCs learn from them.  Then think about their personality and quirks.  Lastly, decide if they\'re going to be a recurring NPC or not. Even if they\'re not ""useful"" anymore, they can add to the world building.\n\nGenerally speaking, if the players are smart they won\'t try to kill NPC informants. That\'s how they lose information and open themselves to getting counter-attacked by the enemy powers that be.\n\nAs for antagonists, remember that the mid-to-high level enemies aren\'t dummies. They usually have witnesses, bodyguards and contingency plans. If they fight they probably do so by sending out minions and thugs who they can disavow later.  And don\'t forget, if the PCs are too careless the antagonists will find ways to punish them.\n\nLastly, don\'t be afraid of action scenes! The system has rules for gunfights and car chases for a reason. The key with WoD is making sure the action scenes have stakes and consequences.  Always ask yourself ""What\'s on the line here?""\n\nI hope at least some of this tirade is hopeful, be sure to let us know how your game turns out!', 'I had some players that defaulted to murder hobo whenever we played, but reminding them of the reality of the game\'s fiction usually made them less murder happy. They were just used to video games where there aren\'t any real consequences for killing an NPC to take it\'s hat or whatever. \n\nWoD gives you the advantage of reality\'s consequences. If they are in a city and murder someone or attack someone, the cops get called on them. If they kill people and don\'t get caught right away, suddenly there\'s stories of a serial killer out there murdering people and night and the whole city is under curfew as a result.\n\nIt helps to slow down the game, if they want to do something that seems like it\'ll lead toward a kind of game you aren\'t into or that goes counter to your story, then make them aware of the sever consequences that come with the action. It\'s like the ""yes and..."" technique with improv. Yeah you can attack that guy no problem and when you do his body guards will open fire immediately, or yes you can attack the guy and since you weren\'t hiding your face on the way in your face will end up suspect #1 for this. Make them aware of the consequences and give them a chance to come up with a new approach. \n\nA lot of times when you explain the potential fallout from their actions they will rethink it. If they don\'t rethink their actions, then you let the consequences take place and let the fiction of the game play out the way you said it would.

I'm not a math person, but I know that there's **got** to be a way to translate between one system of dice rolling to another. Is there any rule of thumb for how to convert? Like, one dice in d10 is a..... +6 to succeed in a percentile system?     

Any help would be appreciated, thanks!    ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3s8t0/how_to_convert_d10_dice_pool_ruleset_to/,"['Hi, mathematician and homebrew dungeon master here. I’m not sure I totally understand your question but I’ll try to answer it.\n\nIf you roll 1d10, there is a 10% chance of getting any particular number. If you have a 40% chance of success, a good way to do this is to say you must get 7 or higher on the d10. If this is too much math then think in terms of failure (60% chance of failure, 6 and lower fails).\n\nIf you have percentiles between 10% intervals, you can add a second d10. Rolling 2d10 gives you 1% intervals. The d10 should look different. Choose one to be tens place and one to be ones place. If you have a 27% chance of success, you have a 73% chance of failure. Anything 7 or lower on the tens dice and a 3 on the ones dice fails. \n\nEvery d10 you add gives you another point of precision. 3d10 gives you 0.1% intervals, 4d10 gives you 0.01% and so on. If you had a 83.8572% chance of doing something, not sure why, you need 6d10. \n\nThe last time I played with d10s I was playing Scion. In that game you roll one d10 for every point you have in a stat. A 7 or higher is a success. You count up successes to see if you succeed in the roll. For example if you had a 5 in intelligence and you roll 5d10, and you need 3 to win, and your roll is 2 3 7 8 8, you would succeed. There’s more rules about critical success and critical fail that you can find online. I use a system similar to this with d8 in my homebrew game. \n\nThe problem with this system is the more dice you have in your hand, the closer the average will tend towards one thing. If you need 7 or higher, the more dice you have, the more likely it is that about 40% of your roll will be successes. Depending on how the dungeon master scales difficulty as players improve stats, this can go disastrously wrong. This is because of something called the Law of Large Numbers in statistics, and if you want to play with this system you should read a few paragraphs of the Wikipedia about it.\n\nI’m not sure I answered your question. If you clarify I can give a better answer.', '&gt;I\'m not a math person, but I know that there\'s got to be a way to translate between one system of dice rolling to another.\n\nSure. You can calculate the odds with something like anydice, create a conversion table and refer to the table during play.\n\nThe chances of getting at least 1 success (8 or greater) on a given number of d10 dice is as follows:\n\n|Dice count|Chance of at least 1 success|\n|:-|:-|\n|1d10|30%|\n|2d10|51%|\n|3d10|66%|\n|4d10|76%|\n|5d10|83%|\n|6d10|88%|\n\nIf you want to include stuff like exploding dice (keeping the success at 10 and re-rolling it), and differentiate between one and more successes, this becomes more complicated. But maybe the ""social meneuvering"" rules don\'t need as much detail - I\'m not that familiar with WOD.\n\nThe basic formula in [anydice](https://anydice.com/) is\n\n    output [count {8,9,10} in 6d10] named ""6d10""\n\nGood luck with the conversion.', 'I\'ve read your question, and the answer is ""no,"" there is no rule of thumb. It all depends on the dice pool system you\'re using. There are two core issues: (1) do the number of successes required change and (2) does the target number change? Most dice pool systems use one or both of these methods to alter difficulty. The higher the target number required, the harder the check. The more successes required, the harder the check. \n\nFor example, if you only need 1 success, and you roll 1d10, that\'s easy. The conversion is whatever number marks a success. If you need a 7 or more, a single d10 is the equivalent to +40% (in a roll under system) or +60% (in a roll over system) because you have 4 numbers you could roll out of 10 which yield a success. But if you get to roll 2d10, you still have a 40% chance of success with the first die, plus a 40% chance of success during the 60% of the time you fail on the first die. That comes out to a 64% chance of success (+24% over the initial 40% chance). As you can see, the percent chance of success is not increasingly linearly. Each additional d10 has a diminishing return. If you rolled 3d10 the total chance of success is 78% (a little more, actually, but I\'m ignoring the space after the decimal). That means the first dice added +40%, the second dice added +24%, and the third dice added 14%. This is what I mean by diminishing returns. \n\nBut what if you the target number can change? If the target number is 9 (on a d10), you have an 20% chance of success (2 numbers out of 10 yield a success), 2d10 is 36%, and 3d10 is 48%. That means that the diminishing returns are now +20% for the first dice, +16% for the second, +12% for the third. This is not even remotely proportional to when the target number was 7. \n\nNow, what if the number of successes can change? 2d10 is 64% against a target number of 7 and 1 success. But it\'s only 16% against a target number of 7 and 2 successes (16 combinations out of 100 yield 2 successes). 3d10 is only slightly better - I think it\'s like 28% against 2 successes and a target number of 7. \n\nIn other words, dice pools don\'t add constant increases in success chance. So each dice in a dice pool system is impossible to convert to a flat bonus in a percentile system. \n', 'So is your target number 6? Or 7? Is a 6 a success?\n\nBecause AnyDice can help you make huge tables or charts, but this little number will set you up for one pool at a time: http://www.unseelie.org/cgi-bin/dicepo.cgi', 'The problem is that each successive die doesn\'t increase the chances of getting a success linearly.\n\n[Look at these results in Anydice](https://anydice.com/program/a3b/at_least/graph).

I always ask my new groups if they want this to be a Vote in party?\nThe idea is people are always welcome to bring new players but at the end of the game (usually I just message people afterwards for a yay or nay) we vote to see if we want to make the new player permanent. Seams to work pretty well and let's people decide on new players. "", ""For me session 0 is all about getting the players to buy-in (a lot of which is basically building hype, getting players excited, etc) and making sure everyone is in a position where they are ready to go come session 1. Now, a lot of how I run my session 0 is based on what has happened before it which is normally:\n\n1. A system to play in has been agreed upon (D&amp;D 5e, B/X, Lamentations of the Flame Princess, Savage Worlds, etc)\n2. We have agreed on a setting\n3. We have agreed on a style of campaign, this is often tied directly to the setting but we get somewhat specific as to amount of combat vs RP vs social encounters to be expected, if it will be a hex crawl, dungeon crawl, sandbox, railroad, etc.\n4. Inevitably some of my players will have already decided on a character and gotten most of it built beforehand (it is always just some, and so I work with them in advance to make sure it fits the world and make sure that they are ok with changing some stuff based on info that will be dispersed during session 0)\n\nThen, at the session 0 itself I give anyone new to the system a rundown of how it works, go over the steps for character creation and get those who haven't already generated one started on that process so they can roll some dice and write numbers down while we go over some game details. A lot of the session is spent working with the players to build their characters and explaining in greater detail what the campaign is going to be like. I like to make sure that the players have a clear understanding of what to expect in regards to the style of play, level of magic or tech or what have you in the setting, and if we have agreed that the players will share a background or know each other in advance then we'll flesh out what needs to go into that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce people have a workable character concept and have the basic parts generated we go into question and answer time. This is where I try and get players to think about random aspects of their characters that they might have overlooked, and it gives players to have somewhat less of a nebulous background. My questions are normally really targeted and force players to come up with things on the spot that will remain true for the campaign, also since I let players have full control in their answers this will often also build out more of the campaign world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince I normally run low prep games a lot of the setting and backstory is malleable so anything said during the Q&amp;A is the truth of the land from then on. Also a lot of the time I'll tie a couple of questions together to have players expand on ideas they started previously. The sort of questions I've asked are:\n\n* What kingdom/town/country/planet are you from?\n* Follow up: How did you feel when it was destroyed and you knew you would never be able to go back?\n* How did Player A's character meet Player B's character?\n* Follow up: What did Player A's character do to make Player B's character swear an oath to protect them from harm?\n* When did you lie about who you were when you joined The Company, and what was your actual reason for joining?\n* Follow up: What happened when your lie was discovered?\n* When you were working in Psyops for the government, what was the most horrific thing you had to do, and why didn't it make you quit?\n\nNote, some parts of the questions are based on aspects of the character that the player determined, but sometimes I impose a new fact about the character on them in the asking of a question (ie. your home was destroyed, or you have a sibling, things like that).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as questions I like to get asked, the only thing I can think of is when a player has a really cool idea that they can't figure out how to make work by the ruleset, and working with them to figure out how to make their concept work mechanically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd lastly, for what I want to accomplish by the end of the session, I want everyone to be excited for the campaign, be ready to start come session 1, and have a solid grasp of who their character is (not so much having a huge backstory with tons of history, but I want them to know the character's personality and one or two key points of why they are the way they are).""]"

rpg,t3_a3q65z,"Why All the GURPS hate?I like GURPS.  I've been playing it since second edition and it's my second favorite system, after Call of Cthulhu.  I've noticed a lot of people in the gaming community pile a lot of hate on it and am curious as to why.  The system is pretty simple, there is a wealth of material for the game. and the generic aspect means you can plug whatever campaign you'd like to play into the system and run with it.  No, it's not a rules light system, but there are players out there who don't mind, and sometimes enjoy, a more crunchy game.  (I'm a Rolemaster veteran, so I definitely don't mind lots of charts and rules!)  So tell me, why do so many gamers stay away from GURPS?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3q65z/why_all_the_gurps_hate/,"[""Honestly? Steve Jackson Games. It's not like it's some protest against them, but they've done a terrible job presenting GURPS.\n\nFirst, the core rulebooks make learning the game much, *much* harder than it has to be. As a toolbox, it's fantastic for creating the game you want. If you're using it to learn the game, it's awful compared to many other games. It feels like you need to read the whole thing and cut out the bits you don't want, rather than starting with a simple core and building up. GURPS Lite helps solve the issue a bit, but that's practically hidden away. Personally, I would go with a Savage Worlds approach, with a cheap slim core rulebook, and put the rest in expansions. Speaking of expansions...\n\nThey had a reputation for churning out too many needlessly specific books, and didn't really do much to combat it. They still put out GURPS content at a fast clip, and while that's great for the content creators, it's overwhelming for a new player, especially when they don't make it particularly clear that the Basic Set really is all you need, and the expansions aren't necessary to play a genre. Speaking of content creators...\n\nThey completely dropped the ball competing against D&amp;D 3e. The OGL meant there was a TON of content being produced for D&amp;D, and seeing how much extra stuff was out there was a selling point. It didn't even have to muddy the waters with the core products, since you knew they were from other publishers (granted, WotC really did churn out content themselves). Instead, GURPS was entirely too precious about their game, and neither released some basic version of their game under the OGL, nor did they try particularly hard to use their *generic game engine* to make games for licensed properties. There's Mars Attacks, which is just about it. (I know.) I honestly think they could have been a major contender if they just tried to put the system out there. Speaking of putting the system out there...\n\nThey do not advertise GURPS. Period. Seriously, I'm not exaggerating. Remember Free RPG day? GURPS had the recently released GURPS Dungeon Fantasy. They could have put a little quick start in there, or GURPS Lite with a little note card about Dungeon Fantasy, or heck, some dice or something pointing people to their new product. You know what they put in instead? A Munchkin card. Then they complained that Dungeon Fantasy wasn't selling as much as they had hoped. George R. R. Martin has been an outspoken fan of GURPS for ages, and they never tried to do a Game of Thrones tie-in, even when it would have been easy. There's a podcast called The Film Reroll that uses GURPS to play through movies, and as far as I know, they've never gotten so much as a message from SJG, despite the fact that they honestly do more to advertise the game than the company does.\n\nSo, to sum up why people stay away from GURPS:\n\n* They have no idea it exists.\n\n* If they do, they think it's been out of print for like a decade.\n\n* If they don't, they think you need a dozen books just to play the game.\n\n* If they don't, they think the rules have to be really dense and crunchy.\n\n* If they don't, they think the game is hard to learn and set up... and they're not wrong.\n\nHonestly, to get someone into GURPS, it's on *you* to be their guide, and explain why it's worthwhile, where to start, and how to do it. Meanwhile, SJG will do nothing and say GURPS isn't selling because RPGS as a whole aren't selling, and haven't been since like 2005. Grr.\n\n/rant"", 'I love GURPS, and I miss the days when it was well respected in the industry, even if you didn\'t play it.  Back in my day (cute dinosaur walking past) people would recommend GURPS books as research material for both setting and make-a-fun-rpg tips even for non-GURPS games.\n\nToday, the problems are:\n\n* Barely supported by the creator (more on that below)\n* Too inaccessible (How often do you see GURPS books?)\n* Too hard to get started - GURPS is actually easy to play, be starting a game requires a ton of effort, and the book is 60-80% invalid material for any given campaign/setting.  My dream app is where the GM selects which adv/dis/skills are in play and maybe a few dials on rule granularity and can get a custom book with just the relevant material.  Otherwise, the normal (to me) RPG experience of flipping though the book/PDF for inspiration is replaced by distraction and frustration.\n\nAbout SJG:   I won\'t claim I\'m not crushingly disappointed by their minimal support - disappointment that gets renewed every year.   That said:\n\n* I truly appreciate that they haven\'t killed it.  e23 continues to generate new material, and given that SJG obviously believes they make more money for each dollar spent in other areas, I am really glad that decide to send some money ""inefficiently"" keeping GURPS on life support.  That\'s not out-of-character for SJG, but that just means they are more awesome, not less.  Many a great game has been killed for less in countless other companies.\n* Their decisions make (financial) sense.  GURPS hasn\'t been a top-5 game in decades (it really was at one time!) and while I think it could find a means to compete with the currently popularity of narrative games in a world where the gamers of old are now possessed of families and/or a lot more entertainment options, I have a hard time saying with 100% confidence that that would be financially a win.  Saying it would be MORE of a financial win than the money-printing Munchkin empire is likely a flat out lie.', 'I bought 6 books and started working on a cyberpunk setting. Despite liking the benefits and bell curve of the 3d6, I quickly realized getting multiple people to read and understand the combat rules would prove too difficult.\n\nThe system has a lot of strengths, buy requires a lot of upfront prep both for campaign and sessions.

First, some people just aren\'t into it and get tired of seeing it recommended all the time.  Enough people are familiar with it that there will always be a few naysayers when it comes up.  Fate has the same problem.  Second, I think that GURPS reputation of complexity is well earned, and some claims around it\'s simplicity are rather misleading.  Personally, I don\'t like GURPS, but I try not to nay-say when it comes up.  But since you asked...  \n\nOne thing that bothers me is the insistence that GURPS is as simple as you want it to be.  I always see people say that GURPS is just ""roll 3d6 + modifiers under skill level"", but that\'s like saying that D&amp;D is just ""roll 1d20 + skill level vs difficulty"".  That\'s just the roll mechanic, there is tons of complexity around the roll that makes the system complicated.  Sure, I could resolve D&amp;D fights by simply having someone roll + attack bonus vs TN 15, if they succeed they win the fight; if they fail they lose 1/4 HP.  But that doesn\'t mean D&amp;D combat is simple and there is nothing in the books that suggests or supports that I should run combat that way.  As far as I can tell, the same is true for GURPS, but I keep seeing this insistence that this is a core trait of GURPS.\n\nI see people insist that GURPS is modular, so a lot of complexity can be removed for simpler modules, but that\'s not really true either.  It starts complicated and has lots of modules to make it even more complicated (with a few exceptions like wild card skills).  My primary experience with GURPS has been with GURPS Lite, and it\'s still one of the most complicated systems I\'ve ever encountered, up there with Shadowrun 3e and D&amp;D 3.5.  Sure, the page count isn\'t that long, but it\'s extremely dense and detailed.  They\'re like pages from a calculus textbook.  You\'ve got things like swing vs thrust, complicated parry rules, multiple defense types, etc.\n\nGURPS is generic and universal, but also repels abstraction.  It\'s built from the ground up with detailed simulation in mind.  So when you try to abstract the more detailed subsystems away, it causes problems as related subsystems lose the detail they needed to work.  I\'m not interested in counting every lbs of equipment or every dollar of wealth, but I don\'t want throw them out completely.  Other systems provide abstractions to make tracking that stuff easier, but GURPS expects you to track it in detail you have to come with your own abstraction that conflicts with the detailed lists GURPS provide.  It\'s more work for less.\n\nGURPS is too ""noun-based"".  There are many precise lists of precise things that have similar effects, but are not quite the same because the real world equivalent are not quite the same.  I prefer effect-based systems, where you have a list of mechanical effects, and you simply assign the appropriate ones to the thing you are trying to emulate.  It\'s a lot simpler and flexible, in my opinion.  I\'ve found other systems make it easier to build what I need without having to comb through as many extensive lists.  I feel like I can do a lot more with less effort in a system like BESM than I could with GURPS.\n\nIt just takes too long.  I had a discussion with one GURPS fan about the merits of rules-lite narrative and improvisational play.  How you can get to the action and drama quicker and things like aspects give you quick hooks to get into character.  I gave the example that I could have players create characters, decide to be adventures exploring an ancient temple, and run that entire thing in a single session with no prep beforehand.  His counter response was that he\'d spend an entire session just roleplaying interviewing potential pilot candidate NPCs and it would likely take multiple session for the PCs to form and buy a comprehensive list of supplies for the trip, so he had plenty of time to prep the actual temple.  He told me it often took players 12+ session to even figure out what their PC personality is like, but the extra time investment made it more worth it.  I just don\'t have that kinda time.  Most of my campaigns are done within 12 sessions.  I\'ve got too many different campaigns I want to run to dedicate decades to a single campaign.\n\nI\'m just not a big fan of realism.  Even if I like a bit of hard sci-fi, I still like heroic action movie style play.  GURPS starts too realistic and takes too much time to customize towards my tastes.\n\nThere are too many source books.  I have several universal games that I could run anything I could imagine from the core book.  I\'m sure you don\'t really need all those extra books, but yet I always see references to all these extra source books if you really want to run a specific genre of GURPS or have access to a specific rule that solve a specific issue.\n\nUltimately I don\'t think GURPS is a bad game.  It just doesn\'t do anything I want and does a bunch of stuff I don\'t.  Similar to how some people just don\'t like Fate after trying it several times, I\'ve just never been able to get into GURPS despite multiple attempts.', 'Skill proliferation.\n\nIt makes character creation fiddly, and the more you add supplements, the worse it gets.\n\nThis gives it a narrow range of character effectiveness where it works well, and the scale does not handle growth well.\n\nThe idea of being simulationist is better in theory then it tends to play at the table.', ""I use GURPS when i want a deadly, gritty world.

rpg,t3_a3p4ls,"A non-combat, non-statistical systemHey guys,

So I've never GM'd before but I'm thinking of running a game soon. I was thinking of basing my world around the animal kingdom and having the PCs be sort sort of mid-food chain kind of creatures, put together and sent on a quest to save the natural world.

I really don't want the game to be about 'levelling up', looking up rules or statstical bonuses and stuff like that. I want the characters to be mostly solving problems of new terrains, new dangers they encounter and survival issues (food and water) using a mix of their chars natural abilities, their wits and their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Not just fighting things other than for food or when forced to.

 I've only ever played some D&amp;D editions and Labyrinth Lord before, so I'm a little worried I might fail to keep the player's attention or that I might not plan it out enough. 

My main questions are:

1) Are there any good systems I could use as a basis? Or how hard would it be to make my own basic system?

2) How do I keep players interested outside of combat? How do I keep the challenges fresh and interesting enough to keep the excitement? Again I want to avoid everything just being 'well roll a D20 and see if you succeed' - I'm looking for more stimulating puzzles. Any advice?

Any other general DMing advice would be helpful too 🙂",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3p4ls/a_noncombat_nonstatistical_system/,"[""So, definitely read some non D&amp;D systems to get inspiration. I really like using Fate Accelerated Edition, which is a very streamlined game meant to emulate adventure fiction. It treats the players more like the authors of a story rather than having them act solely as their characters, which some groups love and some just can't stand, but as an example of a simple system that works, it's definitely worth checking out. "", ""Well, if you're looking for a game about Animals, without too much combat and easy on the rules, I'd suggest reading The Warren.  It's about bunnies, but I daresay you could tinker it up to some sort of slightly higher up the food chain critters.\n\nIt's just about NORMAL (more or less) bunnies though, not about like, bunnies with swords or something, so if that's what you're after (I can't tell) then it's probably a bad idea."", 'I think that sheetless roleplaying would work well for a campaign like that, with a basic d100 or d20 system underlying it. The simplest approach: assign characteristics (the players don\'t have to know them; they should just have an idea how they compare to others) from 3-18. Give them specific skills which add plusses. Don\'t let them have any of the numbers; you want them to think of their characters as personalities and ""people"", not as numbers on a sheet.\n\nThen when it comes to things like combat or skill use, have them describe what they\'re doing and how they\'re approaching it.\n\nI wrote an article on sheetless roleplaying a while ago that you might find useful: [http://runequest.org/sheetlessrpg.htm](http://runequest.org/sheetlessrpg.htm)', ""Fate is a good suggestion.

PCs roll 1-3 d6, where the highest value dictates how well they do; they'll only fail if someone opts to roll a single failure d6 against them.\n\n\n\n&gt;2) How do I keep players interested outside of combat?

There are eight Dangers and eight Augments, general bad possibilities like injury, losing equipment, and ending up in the wrong place, or good possibilities like lasting effect, insight, and positional advantage. It helps you break a complex situation down, and makes traditionally simple rolls with binary outcomes into much more compelling events. Exploring, looting, arguing, managing, building... everything has costs and bonuses, and can be resolved in an interesting way.', 'So other people have talked about everything else, I\'m mainly going to address the part about trying to make game challenges into puzzles, rather than ""roll dice to win"".\n\nSomething that you might want to consider is having players actively roleplay using their own abilities, rather than relying on those of the character. This approach is common in OSR games, and can work very well, especially in games that don\'t rely a lot on fast, detailed actions (e.g. fighting).\n\nThis usually makes for more engaging social interactions and environmental problem solving (exactly the kind of stuff you\'re looking at), but requires more work from the GM (writing up all the relevant details for how a particular obstacle works is a lot harder than deciding what number is required on a die roll).\n\nAnother thing that you need to consider, if you take this route, is deciding what to simulate (players describe actions to resolve problems) and what to abstract (characters use abilities to resolve problems). In general, there are three reasons to abstract an activity:\n\n1. If you don\'t want to spend time on an activity, but doing so is optimal for the players (e.g. haggling over prices at a market)\n2. If you don\'t want advantage/disadvantage players based off their IRL abilities in this activity (e.g. distinguishing the different between poisonous and edible berries based on plant description)\n3. If an activity cannot be adequately represented at your table (e.g. climbing up a crumbling castle wall)\n\nI can probably answer any more questions you have about this approach, as I\'ve made lots of microsystems for personal use based off these principles, and it\'s definitely the approach I would take for the kind of game you\'re talking about.']"

Here is an example mystery I\'m just going to create to hopefully give you some idea what I\'m talking about. Lets say this is your typical fantasy world but we\'re building a Mystery at its heart, the players start in the small town of Kotha, along an arctic pass in the High North Mountains. The town is small but has your usual fantasy trappings, a blacksmith, a wizard tower, etc. The players discover 3 challenges that they don\'t know are related. 1. The Town Blacksmiths, Merchants and most Townsfolk are fiercely superstitious and they do odd rituals constantly to ""ward off evil"" 2. The Town is frequently attacked by Monsters at night during special celestial events, shooting stars, full moons, etc. 3. The Town is older than they thought it was, it is built ontop of vast ruins, crumbling tunnels and even caves etc. all buried in the snow.\n\nSo we have 3 Clues, 3 avenues of Investigation, each layer of investigation should lead to 1 or more Clues.\n\n1. Investigating the Towns People its revealed they are all part of the same religion, an ancient one forgotten in other parts of the world. Its some sort of Druidism probably. They often hold festivals or weddings on Celestial events (this hints at Clue #2 without saying anything outright, the players may assume the townsfolk are summoning monsters but that\'s not right either). The Druidic religion they follow focuses around nature worship and there is a sacred site they often go in the Mountains, a shrine they make a yearly pilgrimage to offer fruits and bounty of the harvests (maybe animal sacrifice). If the Players go to this site they find ancient standing stones covered with the same kinds of wards against evil the townsfolk use, they might fight a monster or two nearby. They can learn from the Stones a ritual to make their own Ward against Evil (The monsters that attack the town are not exactly evil by the way and the PCs can learn that by finding out it won\'t stop them).\n2. The Monsters seem to come during festivals or special times in the village and they attack fericiously at anyone in their way, but they seem focused on the Wizard\'s Tower. Most of them are large dangerous animals or monsters from the Mountain (some creatures aren\'t as dangerous or focused if encountered in the wild). They have learned another Clue though, whether or not they figure it out - someone is sending monsters to attack the Wizard\'s tower. If they think to venture to the Standing Stones during a village festival, they may encounter several Druid priests performing rituals in secret and wearing robes, these men are not from the village but live further up in the Mountain Wilds, they speak a different language and will be hostile to outsiders. (They are the original owners of the land the village stands on though the PCs won\'t know that without reading old history books by investigating the language on the stones or some other method you devise).\n3. The Tunnels below the town are filled with evidence of a once thriving and ancient city with rituals and carvings that match that from the Standing Stones in the mountains (if the PCs have encountered it). The tunnels are infested with undead, people who are wearing the robes and jewelry of the Druids that they might encounter investigating #2. The idols and shrines in the underground city are all smashed or defiled, though the dungeon is filled with typical loot. The undead never venture up into the Town above, if one chases the PCs, have one of the local ""Wards against Evil"" stop them and prevent their ascent. \n\nSo how do you resolve all these clues? Well they\'re all pointing the same direction without coming out and saying what\'s going on. The truth is, the Wizard in the town\'s tower is a disguised Lich, he never leaves his tower and has things brought from the village to him (turns out the Wards against Evil make him a prisoner too) he killed the original Druid masters of the city hundreds of years ago and cursed them to rise as undead and ruled over the people until they became the town that stands today. The surviving Druids live far in the mountains and try to get their revenge by sending monsters at the Wizard Tower every so often. So you have some clues that don\'t force them towards one route or another, but make up pieces of a larger puzzle the players have to put together and hopefully make the right conclusion. They could just as easily miss all the marks and kill the Druids, feeling they slayed the badguys.', 'I sometimes take an opposite approach. Often players will discuss with each other at the table what they think is going on. Often it\'s not right...but it\'s even coolerthan what I had in mind! If I can work it in or tweak my plot to make their suggestion work, that\'s exactly what I do.

rpg,t3_a3nkxw,"Our group just has to kick ""that guy"" out of the group, and it sucked because he is/was a friend. [Rant/Bemoan &amp; Group Conflict stories here, I suppose]First of all, sorry if my writing is janky, I'm on my phone and I suck at phone typing. 

So I've been playing with roughly the same tabletop rpg group for five years (D&amp;D mostly, but other systems too) and this week 5 of our 6 members finally broke the news to Mr. 6.

Overall, I've been blessed with a very stable and rich group experience for most of my tabletop career, but I've gotta say, this is easily the worst experience I've had in the last 11 years with RPGs. I came here to vent and warn you all... communication is key, but some differences are irreconcilable.

4 of our 6 players, including me and my fiance, work together. Mr. 6 is also in that group of 4. The other 2 are old friends from college who moved back to town after graduating. They're return acted as the catalyst that led to this week's events. Before that it was just the four of us, scrapping up fun on short, ramshackle campaigns. Some were good, others fell apart. 

Our standards were low, and while gaming was overall a positive experience, this group's campaigns were never anything too memorable. The problems with Mr 6. started back then, but with only 4 players, we simply endured.

Now that the foundation is set, let me elaborate about our issues with Mr. 6.

1. He absolutely cannot roleplay. At best he identifies a single character trait that his character has, and only pursues that one angle. In other words: he plays a gimmick. Also, because he can't roleplay, all of his character knowledge is player knowledge, unless we police him.

2. He's a min-maxer. Almost every single character option he chooses has a numerical benefit that aids in his gimmick mentioned above. He also cannot recognize the fact he min-maxs everything. A recent character of his was defended with his logic that ""My character is balanced because he has a really low stat to even out his really high stat!"" Completely unaware that is pretty close to the definition of min-maxing.

3. He gets upset anytime his character underperforms in battle or anytime his plot or puzzle assumptions aren't correct. So if he misses more than twice in a row, he checks out. If he assumes a certain NPC is up to something and he's proven wrong, he checks out. If he doesn't ""get"" a puzzle? Checks out. Basically, if he doesn't do awesome, he gets grumbly and jumps on his phone .

4. He cheats. (In fairness, He's gotten better through the years). He used to reroll his dice if he rolled poorly and he thought the dm was distracted and didn't see him roll. Hes been confronted about this though, and now tends to rely on rolling behind debris on the table and scooping up his dice before we can confirm his roll, or ""forgetting what he rolled"" after scooping his dice back up. He's also been fond of inflating modifiers, but I tend to shadow calculate his rolls and call him on it when it happens, so he's backed away from that method.

5. He cannot stay focused. In game he will regularly start interrupting combats or roleplaying with anecdotes relating to recent news or pop culture events. This mostly happens when a different player/character has roleplaying challenge where he is not directly involved, or during a combat where he is doing poorly.

Ok. *sigh*

While issues 1 and 2 are probably the most frustrating with our group, I want to make it clear that those are valid forms of gameplay. Some people can't roleplay well, and some campaigns or systems really expect you to number-crunch for every advantage. We get that. It's just unfortunate that our group has really grown into roleplaying and storytelling, and he just doesn't mesh with our group anymore. Its almost not his fault, he's in his 60s, he grew up with OD&amp;D and AD&amp;D 1st edition. He's Gygaxian. 

While issues 1 and 2 drag the fun down, he's still a coworker and friend, so we could tolerate it... in theory. The bottom line when it came down to deciding he's out are issues 3 and 5. It's not just his in-game performance, it's his around-the-table attitude. (Honeatly issue 4, the cheating, only happens once every few sessions, so that's our lowest concern). 

It's just that 2 years ago my college friends came back and they introduced some honest-to-goodness standards into our group, and our entire groups roleplaying has really taken off! Except Mr. 6. It's gotten to the point where we all are having fun, until he interrupts the bard's intense infiltration/bluff mission with an anecdote about ""how political correctness is ect. ect. ect."". Or he's just start trying to share funny cat videos during combat, those sort of thing. He's dragging the mood down.

Well, this last shift change (our shifts change every 6 months), he couldn't make it work and bowed out. And our group realized something around 10 sessions in... we are having way more fun now.

So it was decided that we would break the news to him this week. Unfortunately, communication was... poor. And essentially he was told 3 separate things by 3 separate players, all at different times. One told him that he just wouldn't fit in the current campaign, and maybe something would work 6 months from now. Another player went with brutal honesty and told him he just can't roleplay and doesn't work with the group anymore. I had told him something in between those two answers. 

It was a mess. None of us wanted him to get hurt, because at the end of the day he is still a coworker and a friend. In our defense we didn't pull this from nowhere. He's been talked to numerous times over the years, the cheating, the interrupting, the lack of roleplaying... none of it has changed with him.

It just felt so good playing without him. Without the constant immersion breaks. But now I feel like crap. And I can't sleep.

How did/do you deal with problem players? I would very much like to hear your experiences or opinions on these sort of events?

Lastly, I was going to post this on r/dnd, but its not really about that game in particular... am I correct in assuming this belongs here? Sorry, new to this sub...

Gygax said, in no uncertain  terms, that players like that should not be tolerated at the gaming table, because that's not what the game was about.  \n\n\nI'm going to follow that by saying you did the right thing.

From what you're saying, it sounds like he's not having much more fun with it than any of you are playing together anyway. "", 'From a player perspective, I had a DM for years who I considered a friend that just turned nasty when I brought up issues with the game. When we started playing, we had a group of people who were interested in playing a RAF game where we could laugh and joke around.  We all had a lot of fun until the DM started imposing penalties on us for not being serious and in character at all time. He would also just push through group and NPC interactions in order to get to the battles. \n\nHe was also a rules stickler who didn\'t actually know the rules. He didn\'t own a DMG until dndbeyond came out, he borrowed mine for years but didn\'t actually read it, preferring to just assume 3.5 rules would translate to 5e. If anyone pointed out to him that he was doing it wrong, he would deny it until you put the evidence right in front of his face and then he would grumble and downplay the importance of his mistakes, belittling those who brought up the mistakes.\n\nOnce we were forced to be serious, players started dropping out of his game to find better things to do. He slowly replaced all the players with people who shared his vision of how DnD should be. Eventually I was the only hold out of the initial group.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, I realized this wasn\'t a fit anymore. The game was too serious and pretentious for me and all of my friends had been replaced by 3 power-players and a guy who just sat there drawing his character and de-railing every combat because ""it\'s in character"". \n\nI quit the game shortly afterwards, telling the DM that the game was too far from what I originally enjoyed about DnD and that I preferred a more lighthearted approach. He basically attacked me through text, belittling my concerns and telling me I was the only player that disagreed with his style and rules. No shit Sherlock, all the players that agreed with me quit! He wouldn\'t let it go. I finally replied ""I already quit your game, what more do you want from me?"" \n\nTL:DR: had a DM that refused to run a game that was enjoyable to his original player group and slowly drove off his original party, replacing them with power players.

Hopefully, I can offer some help based on what\'s worked for me. \n\n1. Yeah, this can be an issue that can really drag down more role-play-focused groups. It\'s a legit concern. My suggestion would be to work around this with him. Ask him to switch up his character, and work with him to make a gimmick *that directly ties into and supports the goals of the party*. If he\'s focused on directly pushing the story forward in a way that matches what the party is trying to do, then it might be less of an issue. \n\n2. I\'m going to be straight-up with you on this - I\'m not getting super-great vibes about your take on min-maxing. Yeah, you acknowledge that it\'s ""a legitimate way to play"", but if I\'m reading your words right, you seem to be tying min-maxing into ""well, it\'s a learned thing because some systems require it"", as if you\'re excusing a negative trait, when some people just like the power fantasy of their character being able to do the things their character is good at, at a really consistent rate. Min-maxing isn\'t a negative or a positive, and it in no way means the person is *less* of a roleplayer. That said, min-maxing towards a gimmick can really, *really* exacerbate issues with people who aren\'t good RPers, so I can get where you\'re coming from with this. It\'s not itself an issue, but it makes the other issues worse. Again, if you help direct his min-maxing into a character that uplifts the group and pushes them forwards towards their goals, this could become less of a problem.\n\n3. Yep, I struggle with this. I get it. You want to run around and feel powerful and do awesome things, and when you can\'t, it sucks. For me, a huge part of the issue is the lack of control over my character. As such, something that really, really helped me is being the one to describe *how* my character fails. Simply being given control of the ""coolness"" of the situation really minimised most of the issue for me, as I now feel like I\'m ""allowing"" my character to fail. \n\n4. Yeah, that\'s not cool. You did say it seems like it\'s gotten better, and it may well tie into issue 3 - if you can solve issue 3, you may see this go down. \n\n5. This is just straight-up an issue. I draw the in-game events between my turns - keeps me quiet, and most DMs don\'t have an issue with it, plus it\'s non-verbal, so I can take in and process the dialogue going on during the other turns - but I don\'t know if your player has a similar method he can use to deal with his distractibility. \n\nOverall, I won\'t deny that it seems like he really is dragging the group down, but I\'m also feeling a bit bad for this other player. I don\'t know how much you\'ve tried to talk with him about these issues, but if he didn\'t know that they were actually issues that were affecting the group until you kicked him out, then that\'s kinda a poor move on your part, especially with the poor communication. I was kicked out of a group over the summer with almost zero communication about the issues beforehand, and it was one of the most frustrating experiences in my life. I don\'t like making games less fun for others, and I would have loved some actual communication and an opportunity to, you know, just *not do* the behaviors that were making the game less fun. \n\nYes, he is causing problems. And you and the rest of the group owe it to each other to deal with the player and the problems he is causing, because no one deserves a negative gaming experience. But if you hadn\'t made an effort to address them head-on with this chap before you kicked him out - and I mean, head-on, laying out exactly what the issues are in a one-on-one conversation, then yeah, I don\'t blame you for feeling guilty. If this is the case - that you haven\'t really talked to him prior to making this decision - and if you want to salvage your relationship and actually deal with the problems he is causing, I would first suggest that you apologise for the poor communication and the way the whole thing was handled. \n\nFrom there, lay out the problems, exactly as you have here. Talk to him about *why* he\'s doing these things - and I mean really dig deep to figure out why. From there you can figure out *together* if it\'s worth making changes to help his continued participation in the game, or if it could be better for him to find a group that fits his preferences. The good news is that a lot of these behaviors tie into one or two problems - gimmicky non-roleplay, and the frustration with poor performance - and those two problems can potentially be addressed with a couple small changes. If he doesn\'t see why his behaviors are a problem and reacts poorly to being addressed on them, then that\'s on him and you shouldn\'t feel bad about that.', ""First and foremost, people sometimes just don't click with a group — and that's okay because the interpersonal issues are very complex.

rpg,t3_a3njw5,"Abilities of a demon of sloth, need suggestionsHi!

So I'm creating a campaign in a country where there's a civil war and as they go along they'll find out the lands have been infected with demons possessing people. They choose people with traits  they can exploit (think seven deadly sins) and amplify them. The players find out how to deal with it and yada yada.

In this case there's a bored lord in a sleepy (which is more depicted as a passing by area) town whp throws parties to amuse himself, which builds up as a sort of escapism, which the possessing demon exploits. Soon enough people (NPCs) find themselves staying longer than they should, don't get anything done etc. The PCs are invited to come over and over again, and the lord will try to hook them with something interesting when they feel doubtful about it. They find clues, people are going missing, stuff like that.

My question is then what would a demon like this have for combat abilities (note, while not a combat oriented demon such as wrath or pride he still is dangerous to a degree) once the PCs discover that he is in fact a demon?

Cheers!

Particularly ones that reduce movement speed and reflex, drain energy/mana/HP, slow time, and decay things slowly. \n\nThe more powerful the sloth demon the more abilities their aura had and the larger it was. Sloth demons were also one of the most heavily armored since they could afford it's reduction in dexterity and remain effective.  "", 'Maybe some mental debuff?', ""I'd try to tie the demon's abilities to its own slothfulness, and then create a mechanic whereby it has to do something active in order to deal with the adventurers. \n\nGive it an idol of rest that glows whenever the players attack, and make it clear that it's absorbing the damage. If they steal it from him, he has to move to get it back, and engage with whoever has it, and in the meantime, he's slightly more vulnerable. His powers decrease in potency the longer he's away from it, but he also becomes less slothful and better at retrieving it.\n\nYou also bring up followers. It'd be possible to tie his powers to them - the more of them he activates, the weaker they are, because he's sacrificing sloth to enable their actions. You could use this to rationalize an escalating battle series, where there's a throng  of weak enemies, a handful of reasonable ones, and a champion before they reach the demon itself, who isn't a capable combatant in his own right. (You'd have to rationalize it as proportional sloth rather than absolute sloth, but that might make things even more interesting. Once his champion is defeated, he is 100% slothful rather than 50% slothful. They have to arrange to defeat him while his charge is alive, or else he's invulnerable.)\n\nAlternatively, focus on the players.

rpg,t3_a3kxdu,"Struggling to find a superhero system for my group that enjoys D&amp;D 5e and the Fantasy Flight SWRPG.Hello /r/rpg! have a group of three players that I would like to run a super hero rpg for. While I have personally played D&amp;D 5e as a DM for about 5 years now, this group only has about a year of experience with it. It's been a pretty big hit with them, though I would consider all of us pretty casual rpg players.

We tried the Star Wars RPG from Fantasy Flight, and it was a pretty big hit with them. However, they just aren't as into Star Wars as I am, and preferred 5e, because of the fantasy system.

Some issues I've seen sprout up with 5e is that this group isn't as good with more complicated rules. When they get above level 7 or 8 or so, turns start taking a long time, due to them having to deal with the rules for the spells, their abilities, the movement/combat mechanics, etc. I feel like it can be a little overwhelming for them. They seem to have more fun at lower levels when it's less to take on.

Here are some things I think they really liked about 5e and the star wars rpg, and some things I'm looking for in a new system.

1. They liked having ""health"". They were a bit confused by and didn't like the swrpg system of health being both wounds and strain, the way critical hits worked, and such. I think this is something they could easily deal with and isn't a deal breaker ofr a new system.

2. They liked having the option to roleplay as much or as little as they wanted. One of them doesn't really like to roleplay in character, and will do a minimal amount. The others roleplay more, and do enjoy it.

3. They like rolling dice.

4. They really like having cool abilities.

5. They love how quick and deadly the fights are in the Star Wars rpg.

6. They enjoy the dice in the Star Wars rpg with the success/failures and advantages/disadvantages.

Here are the systems I've looked into and my concerns about each.

City of Mist

* The ""tag"" system was so loose and flexible that it was a bit overwhelming for them. I think they were okay with the FATE-inspired system in general, but they really disliked the tags. I think in the end the system felt a little too ""loose"" to them.

GENESYS

* My main issue with GENESYS is there aren't defined rules or supplements for superheroes. It feels like I'd have to design the system from the ground up or use a partially-baked system a fan made up from the GENESYS core book, which makes me a little uncomfortable. I really dislike the magic system in GENESYS too, and I'm worried it won't translate to superpowers well either.

Savage Worlds with Super Powers Companion

* Complaints I see about this system is that it asks a lot of the players with respect to rules. We'll play once very couple of weeks for about 6 or 7 hours, and I'm worried this might be throwing too much at them. Additionally, I'd like to do a mix between Worm and My Hero Academia, and people have complained it doesn't do cosmic-level powers well. People said it's more suited for a Daredevil type character rather than a Green Lantern, for example.

Mutants and Masterminds

* I guess this is the one I'm leaning towards most right now. It's very similar to D&amp;D, which is a good thing, since it'll be an easier transition. But I've heard the fights can be very long-winded, and it's still a very crunchy system that requires a lot of knowledge from the players. In general, my players tend to not like longer fights. Part of what they really enjoy about the star wars system is the quick and deadly fights. They tend to enjoy mystery-based campaigns with fights and moral quandaries mixed in.

* ICONS

I haven't looked into this one too much, but I was hoping people could let me know if this sounds like a good fit for our group? I don't have too much experience with FATE. My only PBTA game was City of Mist which didn't go super great due to how loose all the rules/powers felt, and I'm a little worried this might fall flat for the same reasons.

I'm open to suggestions, and just because I've criticized a system doesn't mean I'm not open to trying it! Of these, I've only played the SWRPG, City of Mist, and D&amp;D 5e.

If they learn the rules (which aren't hard), you can try out other genres with them without requiring them to learn new rule sets."", 'First of all, thanks for referencing *Worm*: I\'m not a native English speaker, and discovering these gems is always a pleasure for me, I\'m totally going to read the entite webcomic!\n\nI want to talk in defense of Savage Worlds and its Super Powers Companion (note: I have the Deluxe Edition of the core rules, and the second edition of the SPC).\n\nThe requirements:\n\n1. SW is a system with wounds and levels of fatigue, in order to keep the combat fast. Toughness is what you raise if you want to have an equivalent of ""more hp"".\n\n2. Roleplay as much or as little you want: you have super hero work to do!\n\n3. At least two dice every time they roll... and you roll a lot during fights! Your heavy hitter might enjoy rolling 7d10 of damage against that giant robot!\n\n4. Superhero and shonen tropes start with the superpower (ex: One for All) and then the various abilities (One for All grants Super Strenght, Jump, Endurance...). With SW you start from the concept (I want a Deku type of character) then you choose the powers (Super Strenght, Jump, Toughness, Attack - Melee, Attack - Ranged) *because* the character has that superpower, and add the trapping and flavour you prefer. Both Deku and Bakugou have Attack-Melee, but Deku kicks are a question of strenght, while Bakugou lands explosion powered punches. You can fly thanks to wings, jet-pack or psychic power, but Flight is a single power. What makes the single powers cool is the aspect that the player give them.\n\n5. Initiative is card based: the Master deals the cards covered, and then calls them from Ace to figures to 10 to 2, and with a Joker you can act whenever you want (annd receive a bonus to roll and damage): the excitment on a player face when he suddendly reveals a Joker to stop the villain from attacking an ally is a precious event! A round can take few minutes, but a skilled player (one that has played 3-4+ session of SW) can take less than 30 seconds to destroy a troup of enemy minions with an area attack (ranged? Entangle? Mass paralysis? Matter control? Telekinesis? Tornado? Earthquake? All of this are possible area damage powers!). Your characters can use the terrain to gain advantages, do tricks, trap the enemies and so on... And yes, a fight can be deadly: a lucky roll can deal 4+ wounds to a player character, causing him to go unconscious and start bleeding, in a race against time for his life!\n\n6. Savage Worldshas 3 basic results: failure (a roll under the Target Number), success (a roll above the TN) and success with a raise (4+ above the TN) which causes additional effects.\n  I don\'t know the mechanics of advantages/disadvantages in Star Wars, but if it is similar to adv/dis in D&amp;D, Savage Worlds has Bennies, a meta currency that can be used to reroll dice and soak wounds. \n\nRules: Yes, Savage Worlds has some rules as a system *and* as a super power system. But it has setting and situational rules and you, Master, can decide which and when apply. \n\nA Super Strong character can\'t make huge jumps if he doesn\'t acquire the Jump power (remember: being All Might *justifies* him having Super Strenght and/or Jump, but doesn\'t *grant* him these powers if he doesn\'t spend Power Points om them). HOWEVER! Spending a Benny he can mometarily change Super Strenght in Jump or Speed or every power he can justifies for the situation.\n\n*For example, Bull-Head is a super strong superhero dealing with a pycocinetic villain. He pands the final blow to Wildfire, but with a grin, before being incapacitated, the villain reveals that he set ablaze a hospital! But the hospital is to far from the place of the fight! Therefore Bull-Head spends a Benny to change all his Power Points in Super Strenght in Power Points in Jump, achieving the longest jump possible: he will throw himself in a straight line using his powerful muscles, landing nearby the hospital. After the jump (and/or three turns), he reaquires his Super Strenght without spending Benny, just in time to enter the hospital and grab as many patients as possible!*\n\nYou can also use Bennies to do powerful combos:\n\n*Bull-Head, Steel-Punch and Wildfire have to cooperate against a Frost Giant. Alone, they can\'t make enough damage, but Steel-Punch has a plan: he spends a Benny and acts with the other two. Bull-Head (super-strenght) grabs Steel-Punch and throws him to the giant head, while Wildfire set ablaze (control of energy: fire) Steel-Punch\'s fists: with the throw and the flaming hands, Steel-Punch deals a powered Melee Attack to the enemy\'s face, causing maximal damage! (it depends on the power points of his companions in Super Strenght and Energy Control, plus his base damage).\n\nThe power level depends on how much Power Point you gran them. With 10-15 you can do Daredevil with ease, and Green Lantern with 35-40. Yes, with 70+ Power Points  most superheroes will be indistructible and one shot many enemies, but you just have to change the level of threat. No more thugs, here you are Galactus. Or... can they really punch the president that wants to ban supeheroes? A political threat can\'t be win with superpowers alone. And remember the example above: mot only there is a villain to fight, but he puts civilians in peril, how can we fight him and save them at the same time?\n\nHowever, for the Power Level in My Hero Academia, your charactes can start with 5-10 PP, and receive 5 PP for Rank (to a maximum of +25 PP for the fifth and last Rank). I have to try building him, but I think that All Might has 40-50 PP (only All for One probably has 100+ PP, but he is a NPC villain, he screws the rules!).\n\nLastly, I suggest testing Savage Worlds with one or two one-shots without the Super Power Companions, just to grab the basics. Then, after a quick glance at the core books and the spc, your player will be able to create almost every possible hero they desire (remember: trappings!).', 'Champions, the granddaddy of Super RPGs.

rpg,t3_a3jxhb,"Searching for game systemI tried /r/DnD and the usual preliminary Google searching, no luck yet.

I'm pretty sure I remember being exposed to a small press or indie tabletop fantasy game that was designed to be a single player game that takes you through the experience of creating a villain (or villainous group) and building their dungeon/lair. You would expand it over time, defend it from threats, possibly recruit new allies, and so on. The idea was that you could stop when you felt like it was appropriate to do so, and you'd have ended up with an antagonistic force and their home base, suitable for use in your DnD game.

It's not helpful for every kind of game, though.\n\nIf you're looking for additional game recs: Do you have much of a game collection yet (so we know what not to suggest)? What games have you already read or played that you enjoyed? Knowing you like narrative is a good place to start, but there's a couple different ways that can go down.

(For example: I know Basic Fantasy RPG is like $5 printed, but it's a pretty traditional dungeon fantasy style game and doesn't sound like your thing. FATE Accelerated is around there too and that leaves you plenty to pick up some fate dice and some settings/maybe a toolkit.)\n\nMy game buying advice is: pdfs for things you just want to check out, hard copy if you definitely 100% are going to run something for sure.

But that's all it does, of you want to then go and play a cyberpunk game or a dungeon crawl your going to have to look at a new system and spend more money. However, something like Savage World's gives you the tool kit you need to run a huge variety of games all with the same system and all quite well. That said if your group is already running dime games with GURPs or Basic Fantasy or Savage Worlds then something like blades or tales from the loop is awesome because they do that one specific thing so well that it gives you an interesting and focused experience for that one game.\n\nSimilarly if you already play a bunch of a system like PbtA and you just want to run that system for a new style of game Disney within the system can be great.

Also I know a lot of people that struggle with PbtA games for longer term campaigns but find it ideal for one offs and short campaigns (~10 sessions).

rpg,t3_a3iuqf,"Too much lore kills the lore ...If a too big amount of rules can be detrimental to a game, so can be a too big amount of lore.

Before you go any-further, keep in mind that my criticism only apply if you go by the book. If your go to method is usually to do whatever the fuck you  want as a GM, well you're not wrong, it's not like I'm your mom or something.

You see I have grown tired of all the lore heavy games such as oWoD, CofD or L5A for the following reasons :

* The first problem is that unless you manage to have your players at least one or two times a week to play, it's not even worth bothering to read the game.The main point of such game is to explore this big universe, like you would explore a big sandbox, but the sheer size of said sandbox makes it impossible to have short campaigns because there's so much information for both the GM and the players to assimilate. Also you'd better not have a hiatus in your campaign or all you have learned will be lost and probably no one will remember what the fuck was the campaign about in the first place. In other words if you already struggle to plan your games, don't bother.

* The second problem is that such games will oftenly put unecessary layers of complication on the plot, the most guilty of this problem would probably be WoD. You see it usually goes like this : there is a conflict between multiple factions (Camarilla VS Sabbat, Chaos  VS Everyone Else etc) but wait ... said factions are usually divided into multiple ""clans"" with different goals. But wait! The clans have conflits going on inside of them which divides them and splits them into multiple ""subclans"". But wait! Major character X who was part of clan Z betrayed his kind for clan S but it was actually a ruse so he never betrayed clan Z ... until it is revelead that he was actually a Double Reverse Quadruple Agent working for the evil faction,  even if it was previously stated before that he was impossible to corrupt now he totally is for plot convienience. In other words authors commit way too often the sin of uncecessary complicated plot with retarded plot twists just for the sake of it. 

* The Third problem is that when you make a campaign, it's easily 95% of the game's lore that usueless. If 95% of the lore is useless then one might assume that he can just ignore it but WRONG! WRONG! WRONG!The lore of a game must be seen as a whole, you can't just ignore a massive amount of the book and just take what fancies you because every parts of the lore is usually interconnected. You might start a campaign with partial information about the lore only to find out that you whole campaign is now irrelevant by regards of the lore because of an information you weren't aware of but now you're fucked since your campaign already started.

* The fourth problem is that the bigger a lore is, the more restricve it is. An easy way to spot a game that has too much lore is when you realize that a substantial amount of your campaign ideas will be hard to realize if not impossible in the lore of said universe. I mean hell, If a GM bothers to read your fucking lore it's to give a kick to their creativity, not to have their creativity murdered in cold blood. A campaign that's usually impossible in the lore of such games is when players want to create their own faction from the ground up, unless you build some adamantium-rate plot armor they will usually be oblitarated if you go by the book because they will make of every important characters and ennemy, and even if they manage to build their faction it will end up in something along the lines of world war 3. 

* The fifth problem is that when you play with players who already know the lore of such games, they will  often go out of their way to tell you how wrong you are and how you understand nothing to the game and how ""no X isn't the leader of Y"" or ""No W city can't be under P's control because it's already a part of V"". In other words they'll try to GM themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3iuqf/too_much_lore_kills_the_lore/,"[""Writers get paid to write, usually by the word. They're not going to shortchange themselves.\n\nBut the solution to your problem is very simple: take what you need, change what you want, ignore the rest. Just because there are 8,000 pages of lore doesn't mean you have to use every scrap of it. In fact, for exactly the reasons you outline, attempting to use all of it is usually a bad idea.\n\nBeyond that... is there something you want to discuss, or are you just complaining for the sake of complaining?"", ""This was one of the key reasons I started homebrewing settings; existing settings have too much lore to effectively roleplay them. You want your lore to fit into a postage stamp, not have expansive anecdotes covering the last three geologic epochs of your world's history."", '[deleted]', ""I find it's best to say that, in your game, you're putting your own twist on the game world. Ask them to think of it the same way you might think of a superhero cartoon or movie. It's fine to change things a bit as long as you get the important elements of a setting right."", ""It also depends on the game you're playing. White Wolf is **incredibly bad** about lore. *It's boring as fuck to read*, but you absolutely need to know it to run or play a game. \n\nThere are some games/settings where I know there's lots of Lore, but I only need to read a little bit of it to get a cool idea. I love 7th Sea. I only needed to read a little bit of the Sorcery and setting lore to get an idea that I want to go to Vodacce and fight the one of the Merchant Princes as a bravo. Same for Eberron. I see two pages about Aundair and I want to go to Arcanix. \n\nFrankly, the Honor system in L5R is what keeps me from playing it, more so than the Lore. You can kinda skim it until necessary. \n\nThere's also a difference in lore existing to be read and enjoyed for its own sake, and existing *expressly to be used*. Telling me there's a conflict between two factions for given reasons is a great plot hook, but describing the history of a faction without relating it to anyone else is useless.  Eberron tells us that all of the other Dragonmarked Houses are jealous of House Cannith for its ability to have a hand in every pie manufacturing good. That's a good hint that there's going to be espionage between these corporate fantasy overlords. "", ""I take a different approach.

What I do is read the book in small chunks, and when I find something that really sparks my interest, I write it down with the page number. I collect a couple of the things that I not that work well together, and come up with a scenario that deals specifically with them. I reread those sections and maybe a couple of things that might come up in the game (nearby towns, etc) then I run the game.\n\nIt makes it so that you can really delve deep into parts of the setting that you love, without stressing about knowing it all.\n\nNumenera, for example, has such a evocative setting that I literally flip to a random page of the setting description and read the first section that I see. Usually, I have ideas bubbling up from just that, and I am ready to go. I have never read the setting all the way through, just bits and peices. And I have had some great campaigns of Numenera that way, and I really do feel that we were able to deeply explore the setting."", 'It can be really fun to dig into lore though. I think it\'s better to format it as ""This is the important stuff and this is how it is usually"" to accommodate both sides of the divide.', ""I mostly agree with your core points except for 5. The problem isn't playing with players who know the lore. It's players who know the lore and weaponize that knowledge instead of using it to enhance the game."", 'That’s why you should never go by the book with lore-heavy settings.\n\nBy the way, now CoD is lore-heavy?', '&gt; The fifth problem is that when you play with players who already know the lore of such games, they will often go out of their way to tell you how wrong you are and how you understand nothing to the game and how ""no X isn\'t the leader of Y"" or ""No W city can\'t be under P\'s control because it\'s already a part of V"". In other words they\'ll try to GM themselves.\n\nIn contrast, when I did GMless freeform RP, we\'d *only* use an established setting if everyone was familiar with it, since you *had* to, essentially, GM yourself.', ""It really depends on the player, some games assume the PCs are already pretty familiar with the Lore, but this does create a high bar for new players to that game. World of Darkness games are especially bad, memorizing all the titles and what they do is hard enough in LARP game though was much easier in online games where you could sit and reference the rulebook. Some players eat this stuff up though, it lets them see how the world narrative works and they can more easily find a place for themselves in it. There are some games that seem to need more Lore and leave too many gaps for my taste, but that's a different story. Now, what I find annoying is that the Lore of WoD games and some others is really just a formatting issue most of the time, you have to read 5 pages of flavor text to get to that 1 important page of rules you needed. So the trick is to not put so much flavor text in your book that its impossible to find what you need easily."", 'I completely agree. \n\nThe solution I\'ve found is to begin each and every game whose lore is not mine with the disclaimer that what we\'re about to play is a parallel world version of the one the lore describes. It\'s quite similar, but not the same. Players are OK to assume things as long as I don\'t veto and override an assumption. The more prominent facts are likely unchanged (Vader is likely not Luke\'s aunt, though you just can\'t know it until you hear it from them personally -- how would your character know anyway?), but the farther away you get from these beacons the more differences you\'ll see. (There were in fact ten times as many rebel commandos shipped onto Endor than what you assumed, and it was them who beat the Empire\'s elite there, not the ewoks. The ewoks do exist and they fought bravely, sure, but that\'s it. Another example: In the oWoD, the Sabbat and the Camarilla do exist in my take, but those specific personalities and their deeds that you\'ve read about in sourcebooks and novels? They simply don\'t. You\'ll just have to find out who the Prince of New Orleans or whatever city we\'re using is from me, because this is my WoD (ok, make it ""our WoD"", but you mind you character, I mind the NPCs, ok? :))\n\nA similar and simple take is to play as if a core book got released only yesterday. We\'re going to play V:tM like it\'s 1992 and we haven\'t bought anything else (of the 1st edition) but the 2nd edition core book! Yay! Fresh world!', 'I agree with the OP. Too much lore makes it hard to tell your own story. I like self-contained lore that is more adventure-specific as compared to extensive names and places and timetables world building. ', 'Agreed. Word for word. I absolutely adore old white wolf games, but I hate playing with my fellow old guard because they usually insist on using all the splats and whatnot. Rediculous. ', ""You cannot manage a game world based upon the published Lore for that setting.\n\nAs I'm sure others have already stated Lore is written by writers who get paid by the word.  They are also briefed to produce what is often called 'colour', which loosely speaking is verbal/visual imagery aimed at encouraging customers to open their wallets.  \n\nBut in practice much of this is what I like to designate as 'fluff'.\n\n'Fluff' in my categorisation is information that characters in the game world believe to be true, but which isn't necessarily accurate or factual.  \n\nIn other words its important that the appropriate NPC's and PC's under stand it and beleive it. But it might not be the actual way the world works.  \n\nThis became a vital principle when I was running my WFRP world which was based upon Game Workshops Warhammer Universe, because GW had a nasty habit of changing the Lore related to their intellectual property whenever they thought it might open a few more customer wallets, and so if one was trying to manage a game world based on the Warhammer Universe using their current published Lore then it was going to be in an almost constant state of inconsistency and flux.  \n\nWhich in turn impacts on its 'Realism'  in the eyes of your players.\n\nI found the trick was to read the 'fluff' (because basically as a GM you don't really have much choice if you are basing your world on that particular setting)  and then engineer your own 'meta-phsysical' explanation of how the world works that allows all of that fluff to exist, and be plausible enough for your in game population to beleive and argue about.  But which was flexible enough to be ignored or discounted if needs be.  \n\nAs for your Fifth point....I made it clear from the very start of my campaigns that my game was 'based upon' the Warhammer Universe.  It wasn't the definitive cannonical simulation of the Warhammer Universe, and so they can argue till they a blue in the face about what some trivial scribbling in Lore book says, but this is my world and what I say is the Lore.  The trick being to make sure that 'How the World Worked' did not render any of the canonical references impossible, merely made them controversial, or implausible.\n\nI found this approach worked perfectly for my game, and the only time it caused problems was when I visited WFRP forums and ran into a bunch of 'Lore Hores' who thought that because they had memorised every issue of White Dwarf they were somehow gods authority on what is allowed within the game and what people playing it should be allowed to think."", ""To me, lore is there for the GMs to ensure they have a general answer off the cuff. \n\nTo the players, the world is only what they see and where they (planned to) go. Everything in-between can be a dark void of nothing for all everyone really cares about.\n\nThe reason why GMs may want the lore, the maps, the information is to answer the general questions. What do they see? Where are these travelers from? What hook can you bring out from the stories and make the players care about?\n\nI'm running a prewritten adventure, I have handouts of locations and history for my players in condensed point form which I'm willing to bet my players never read. However, all that lore is for me as well. When they find something interesting they like, I can tie it into some history, suggest more information, etc."", ""In general for me you run into trouble when there's a big gap between player knowledge and character knowledge. This isn't a big issue in Vampire if the PCs are a clutch of new vampires as neither they nor their characters know shit about the world (unless you have a WoD nerd who knows all kinds of shit their PC shouldn't know) so having them be confused about everything and stumble around a bit makes sense. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis often makes fantasy worlds work OK if the PCs are from a little town in the ass end of nowhere it makes sense that they don't know about the world so the knowledge of the PCs and the characters align.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this makes sci-fi campaigns a real headache to run since any civilian would have a ream of knowledge about everyday tech and how it works since the players don't have that knowledge.""]"

Exactly what does sawing off a shotgun do besides increase the spread of the pellets? And is gunsmithing the relevant skill? For now I am just planning on allowing the shotgun to be treated as pistol for the purpose of draw speed (-5 counts) and range modifiers.

rpg,t3_a3hdqp,"Arkelon Chronicles - A Science-Fantasy TTRPGHello everyone!

I have been working on a Science-Fantasy TTRPG with a very small team for quite some time now, and wanted to put it out there to gain a little visibility, since we will have a demo Playtest coming in February on DTRPG, to gain some insight outside of the development team(and also because we like our project, and want to share it with other people that could like it as well!).

&amp;#x200B;

**Welcome to Arkelon**

Welcome to Arkelon, a world of progress, conflicts and incredible diversity.

Following the discovery of an old Alien ruin in the frozen wastes of the North, technology jumped hundreds of years into the future in a very short time frame, allowing the many inhabitants of Arkelon to explore their vast and intricate world. In the wake of this incredible discovery, more primal races struggled to find their place in this new world, their spirituality and way of life being challenged by the new technologies, while others thrived due to these new opportunities. Gods are slowly forgotten, as machines and technologies are able to replicate their miracles.

In this golden age of technological progress and discovery, many adventures unfolds as corporations attempt to gain control of valuable resources, corrupt politicians take control of cities, daring explorers find marvelous archaeological sites, self-proclaimed heroes and villains are worldwide phenomenons, and unseen forces seeks to corrupt the very soul of Arkelon itself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Our Goals**

**Dynamism.** When designing the game, we wanted to allow players(and creatures) to react to their environment, allies or enemies, even when it is not their turn, to keep everyone engaged at any time. We also wanted them to be able to perform multiple actions during their turn, especially at higher levels, whether you are a magic user or a fighter.

**Customization and diversity.** When working on the game, one of our main goal was to allow everyone to make a compelling and personalized character, by also keeping it realistic and grounded in the setting. The many options of the game allows for a good diversity in races, cultures, personality and classes, and two characters will rarely be alike, encouraging creativity and flexibility in your progression.

**Bring fresh air to common fantasy archetypes.** Although it is possible to play as Warriors, Druids, Elves and Orcs, we tried to bring novelty to those classics, either by giving them unique visuals, culture or mechanics. We also created new races and classes to join those classics, creating a complete and unique universe.

&amp;#x200B;

**Arts**

We have arts currently in the making, and below are some example of what to expect will be in the final Corebook:

[https://i.redd.it/vype31dd80121.jpg](https://i.redd.it/vype31dd80121.jpg)

[https://i.redd.it/qwshhdbc80121.jpg](https://i.redd.it/qwshhdbc80121.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

**Core Mechanics**

Arkelon  Chronicles uses polyhedral dice sets, with a D20 as the main dice used to resolve conflicts, and uses a comparative system for combat and active skills. In combat, both parties roll their dices and the highest of the two wins the exchange.

Our Stamina Points system allows characters and creatures to help allies or impair foes at critical moments of a battle with special abilities, even while it isn't their turn, keeping everyone as engaged as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

We do hope to bring this game to Kickstarter next year, to bring you a fully illustrated Corebook, and thoroughly Playtested mechanics.

rpg,t3_a3h0jx,"Running Sandbox campaign in Rule heavy system (Starfinder)Bit of introduction. Couple of months ago I had wish to run Sci-Fi campaign and was looking for good system to do it.  
Eventually I decided for Stars Without Numbers. But than on a whim i started looking at Starfinder. I never thought of it much. I am big fan of d20 and 3rd edition D&amp;D. But I think 5e was good direction. Still i never liked strange middle ground of it being vague while still  being rule heavy. As for Pathfinder with much respect I consider it just 3.7D&amp;D for nostalgic. And Starfinder ? Probably last attempt to sell some of Pathfinder rules before PF2 kicks in, by making d&amp;d in space. Ridiculous, right ?  


Well I was wrong...It took me 10 pages to fell in love with the game. Rule wise its like taking best of 3.5 and 5e and improving it further without making a new system. If you ever loved d20 - this is the pinnacle of d20. And lore wise the ridiculous ""magic in space"" is in fact Valerian to Blade Runner.   


I would perhaps best describe it as ""More of everything"" I never came across system where Equipment list is so extensive it requires its own book :)

That being said. Its bit insane to make sandbox game in system every NPC has shopping list of skills and abilities, and where even equipment has its own levels and abilities...

What this means is (if you couldn\'t infer it) - don\'t do things that will make myself and others look at you like you\'re retarded. As an example: a friend of ours was going to run a game of D&amp;D, and knowing his preference for serious characters, that\'s what I had everyone make.\n\nHowever, as a joke another player and I also make a bunch of joke characters to tease the DM with. We made three bards and a druid with the plan that our three (small - two halflings and a gnome) would ride on the back of the half-orc druid who was in bear form. Our group was *Riding Bearback* (though it was only mentioned afterwards that we should have been all females and gone with the *Bear Naked Ladies* - truly a missed opportunity), and we all had joke names. We let this go for as long as it took for the DM to give us that, ""are you retarded?"" look.\n\nThis can obviously be both dumber and darker, from people asking to borrow your non-magical helmet so they can go ""scoop up some lava to throw on the door"", to stuff like, ""she\'s passed out? I rape her"" (both of these things have been done/said by players I knew). Regardless of the severity, all of it is a no-go.\n\n**2.** My next general rule (a house rule, since we generally play at my house): don\'t make me regret inviting you. This one is as vague and specific as each and every person imagines it to be. Thankfully I play mostly with friends and I don\'t mind giving them shit for their bad habits (I\'m okay with them not cleaning up the gaming table at the end of the night, but I get riled up when they put garbage in the recycling, cans in the garbage, or recycling in the cans, and all the other combinations therein).\n\nThat said, I have had to deal with situations at other peoples\' tables that simply wouldn\'t fly at mine. People getting drunk, smoking up before playing (and letting that get in the way of play), bringing in outside arguments to the game table, etc. are all no-gos. Just don\'t do these things. You may feel the desire to, but the game table is about more than just yourself. That doesn\'t mean you can\'t have a beer or a scotch while you play, or maybe you have anxiety and need some weed to keep yourself calm, just make sure you\'re not going overboard.\n\n**3.** My last one is that outside issues are dealt with outside. You got a smelly player at the table? Talk to them about it *outside of the game*. Maybe someone is flaky? Talk to them outside of the game (you\'ll probably have to since they\'re a flake). This doesn\'t mean you have to solve other peoples\' problems, but for myself, I like to make sure that these problems aren\'t going to creep into the game. This includes the above-mentioned outside arguments.\n\n**In summary:** don\'t do retarded stuff; be good guests; don\'t do things that will affect the game from the outside; and leave your personal issues at the door.\n\nAs a final note: at the top I mentioned that campaign restrictions are a separate topic, but as a general note on this that can run from game to game, or from campaign to campaign is the level of seriousness you want at the table. This is something that should also be discussed before any game, and can include behavior stuff.\n\nAs an experiment for my current campaign, I have decided not to mention any such behavioral restrictions other than ""I run a serious game"". That wasn\'t a rule that my players couldn\'t run non-serious characters, do silly things (like getting into a ""who has the most pompous hat"" competition), etc., just that the game would have an otherwise serious tone. With that mentioned; phone/device use at the table has been over the top, as has out of game talking (on multiple occasions I\'ve had to tell people to shut up while I was describing stuff), joking, and dragging the game off-topic.\n\nOnce I\'ve finished this current campaign, there definitely will be general behavior restrictions based on this information. Not so much that they don\'t wanna come back, but enough to keep them better-focused.']"
rpg,t3_a3gb69,"On the frequency of encountersI’ve been reading a few different systems lately and I’ve found one interesting quirk: there is a wide disparity in how often these systems, even ones with similar “genetics” call for random encounters.

Just to cite some examples:

1. Basic/Expert D&amp;D calls for an encounter roll (1 on a d6) every two turns in dungeons (20 minutes of game time) but only once per day (!) for wilderness travel, although the GM can call for more, up to 3-4 per day. (My source for this is B/X Essentials, which I’m confidant is accurate.) 

2. Basic Fantasy RPG, which sticks pretty closely to B/X in most mechanics, calls for encounter rolls (also 1 on a d6) every 3 turns (30 minutes) in a dungeon but every four hours (6 rolls per day!) for wilderness travel/camping. 

3. D&amp;D 5e is surprisingly vague about the entire concept. The guidelines in the DMG (p. 86) say “Consider checking for a random encounter once every hour, once every 4 to 8 hours, or once during the day and once during a long rest-whatever makes the most sense based on how active the area is. If you roll, do so with a d20. If the result is 18 or higher, a random encounter occurs.”

  18+ on a d20 is roughly the same as 1 on a d6, so that’s fine, but the rest of the advice is vague to the point of being useless.

  Tomb of Annihilation, which is a great hex-crawl, advises three checks per day during overland travel, which seems about right to me. That makes more sense. Each module in 5e appears to have its own logic for random encounters, which is fine, but it also leads to a lot of confusion. 

4. Shadow of the Demon Lord (p. 189) gives encounter checks between hourly (for extreme danger) to twice a day (for minor danger) with different percentages of different encounter types for a variety of contexts.

5. Lots of systems have barely any mention of random encounters, seemingly leaving that entirely to the module writer or the GM. Lamentation of the Flame Princess doesn’t mention them, for example. Nor does Stars Without Number. (There are encounter generators in SWN, but nothing that spells out their frequency, although Crawford does provide some good general advice). 

It's interesting to me to see how different these systems and assumptions about encounters in various RPGs are. There is a huge range from B/X's simplicity and light tough to BFRPG's overcompensation (I love that system, but six checks a day is a bit much) to the totally vague advice from the 5e DMG. I also don't understand omitting rules for encounters entirely. It feels like a necessary element to me: SWN and LotFP assume that the DM will just hack in something from another system without really addressing the issue, and that seems like an omission.

What are your general rules of thumb for random encounters in dungeons or in the wilderness?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3gb69/on_the_frequency_of_encounters/,"[""In our current sandbox campaign, I roll a d20 and compare it to the party's max level and *base* threat rating of the area they are currently exploring (which can go from 0 for roads to 10 for ratkin infested caves), if I roll equal or under this, an encounter happens.I do this once for each hex they cross  outdoors and once in a while while (each 3-5mins normally) in dungeons or camping. \n\nI finger-pick each encounter from a list I have when they happen, which I rewrite after every session, reflecting the changes in the behaviours of the environment because of player's actions.\n\nAlso getting into certain locations trigger **scripted** encounters I normally have pre-planned.\n\nNot every single encounter i prepare is a fight tho, most are NPCs or some kind of scary teaser (like a dragon shaped lightning during a rainstorm)."", 'Instead of frequency think of quality. Make sure your encounters always are interesting and have a point first and foremost. \n\nThe reason why the 5e dnd dmg does not have a random encounter section is because Wizards is trying to leave the decisions to dms on a play by play situation. Wizards is trying to be less heavy handed than in previous editions like in third edition when everything was mathematically planned out on what to do.\n\nThese design decisions are why there is no table for random encounters, and generally you need to consider if random encounters are actually adding anything. When I just started in 1st ed people got bored of all the random encounters since they brought nothing interesting to the table. Only add random encounters if they add tension. For example, the party is low on resources and they are trying to get a quick rest in. Roll for a random encounter then, but not while they are full up and moving.\n\nI hope that these tips explain why the system is the way it is and help you when planning your random encounters.', ""First I roll 2d12 these represent the am or PM hour in Wich the encounter will occur\n\nThen i roll from 1(safe area) to 3 (very dangerous area) extra d12\n\n* If I get one match it is an easy encounter (some scouts)\n* If I get two it is a challenging encounter (balanced encounter)\n* If I get 3 ( it is an inbalanced encounter you should run from)\n\nThat gives me some special results whenever I roll.\n\nI could get more than one encounter but it would be balanced. If I get 2 encounters is either two easy ones or one medium and one easy.\n\nI get the hours when the encounter happens so the players won't be able to plan with accuracy\n\nGet all the info on a single roll.\n\nI also do similar stuff when rolling for shorter time periods.\n\n1hour divided in 10 minutes is 1d6 then I roll another 1d6 to represent the 10minute section where the encounter could happen then I roll other d6s depending on the level of danger in the area. So I usually divide time in sections that can be rolled by dice and then use the matching system to get the results.\n\nThe probabilities are close to the standard 1d6 roll with small increments the more dices are added.\n\nI also have unique encounters for when the clock dice rolls doubles."", ""&gt; 18+ on a d20 is roughly the same as 1 on a d6, so that’s fine, but the rest of the advice is vague to the point of being useless.\n\nNot useless. It's saying that the frequency of checks should be based on the setting, and done at the discretion of the DM. That's perfectly logical, as there would be areas that are much more dangerous than others.

All I need now is to be able to get a couple pieces of promotional art, probably including a halfway decent logo. Please continue reading and see if it interests you!

# What is METAL WORLD?

METAL WORLD (properly written in all caps)— set on a planet known as Ferra— is a tabletop roleplaying setting where the entirety of the heavy metal aesthetic exists together. If Dio sang about it either with Black Sabbath or solo, it fits. Could you imagine seeing it in a Dethklok video? Sure! The artwork of people like Frank Frazetta, Boris Vallejo, and Julie Bell or anything else you might have seen in the core AD&amp;D 2nd Ed. books or early M:tG, where you didn't necessarily know exactly what was happening but it didn't matter too much because it just looked awesome? Oh, Hell, yes. The general tone of the publication (and movie) Heavy Metal? Sure, why not?

Hell is both a continent and an afterlife. You can just physically go there like you would Walmart, but with probably less suffering on your part. You can get a guided tour, which the MegaDevil himself might even give you while offering you the chance to try the microbrews he's taken to making. On the Howling Plains, there's a self-appointed and demon-possessed lawman— the Fire Marshal— who rides a rocket-powered robot horse while dispensing hot justice with his 666-shooters. There are several Atlantises. An undead ship sails the seas, searching for ships to attack so that it can add the dead sailors' body parts to its own structure. The gnomes of Ferra— called ge-nomes— are mad scientists who compulsively focus on new ways to tinker with the genetic structure of life in general. The crown jewel of balls-to-the-wall over-the-topness is Mount Fafnir, better known as the Dracano. It's a volcano that erupts not only lava but dragons. Some of those dragons get trapped in the flow and become part of the mountain, so yes, the Dracano is a ***volcano made of dragons***.

# The system

Mechanically, I've tried to make METAL WORLD as simple as I could while keeping it a playable system with some definition appropriate to the subject matter. I mean, sure, I could have used something like PDQ, but where's the flavor in that? I wouldn't have been able to have five stats so that I could place each of them at a point of a pentagram on the sheet I'll eventually have. Those stats are Death, Power, Prog, Speed, and Thrash, each named for a subgenre of metal. The system is d12-based because A) going to 11 wasn't quite enough and B) when I started making it a d11 wasn't available. The major points of a character are stats, skills/combat maneuvers, Good Things (advantages), Bad Things (disadvantages), and most importantly overall concept. Much of the finer aspects are explicitly left to the players and Metal Lord to work out, such as ""Doug has the skill Eat Anything and Live, which lets him diminish or even avoid the ill effects of any ingested toxin"", ""Rip-Roar has the Good Thing Born In The Driver's Seat, which allows him to drive any type of vehicle he's at all familiar with"", A character's inventory is pretty much defined by what it should reasonably have given its overall concept along with anything it's explicitly acquired. Similarly, whether a character knows how to do something comes down to the same question, with the difference between basic knowledge and a skill being that a skill gives you a bonus whenever it applies.

One unique thing about the setting's narrative-driven mechanics is that it doesn't even care about travel distance or general continuity unless it's important. How long will it take that Raptorian invasion force to arrive? That depends on if you want the band to evacuate as many of the non-combatants as they can or if you want to give them time to make sufficient preparations to drive back. How long will it take for the band to reach the Temple of the King from here? Do you want to focus immediately on what happens there or do you want getting there to be half the fun? Didn't that cliff side get blown up a few sessions ago? As soon as nobody was paying attention it snapped back to the way it was. Nobody notices any of this because it's just how reality is in METAL WORLD. The Gods™ keep it this way to make sure that in a world where ass is constantly being kicked, it's kicked so there's enough left for the future. Noticeable things only change if it's important to the story or if the PCs have otherwise made a point of it somehow.

As far as character types, there are 11 templates (basically races, but a bit more expansive than that) you can apply to your character besides a standard human. Some of them are stackable with certain others. There are no classes, so you can build whatever kind of character you can work out with the Metal Lord. You can build a cyborg barbarian, a 'shroom-chomping shaman who drives a bitchin' airbrushed van, a robot wizard, a dwarf with chainsaw hands, or a demon hunter graveborn. What's a graveborn? It's a METAL WORLD original— the living(ish) child of two undead!

# The book

Counting illustrations and the TOC, METAL WORLD currently sits at 172 pages, so I'd say it's fairly beefy for a first-time writer/publisher. It treats the subject matter with a mixture of playing it totally straight and humor. After all, metal can be pretty ridiculous at times, so you can't take it completely seriously. Sometimes you have to look at metal lightly or you risk becoming that ""Den ve haaates it"" record store owner in Metalocalypse who's way too elitist and serious about what he's into. The looseness I mentioned above shows in the fact that you can run METAL WORLD as seriously or comically as you like.

I currently have [METAL WORLD: The Rough Cut](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/257412/METAL-WORLD-The-Rough-Cut) available as PWYW on DriveThruRPG to A) get more eyes on it to tell me any last things I need to fix and B) get at least a little residual revenue to pay for promotional artwork. The Rough Cut has all the actual gameplay rules and enough of the setting— including some adventure seeds and parts of Chapter 666: The Number of the Bestiary— to give the reader a good idea of what METAL WORLD is like. I'm currently targeting somewhere between mid-February to March 1st for beginning the Kickstarter so I can get my ducks fully in a row to make as closely to certain I have a successful KS campaign as possible. If METAL WORLD sounds like something you'd be interested in, download the Rough Cut and see what you think. Even better, tell me and if there's something I need to fix, I will^(\*)!

^(\*) Since putting up METAL WORLD: The Rough Cut I've identified that debilitating (as opposed to lethal) poisons didn't mechanically work at all as written, so I've fixed them. I just need to get around to updating the file on DTRPG.

rpg,t3_a3ezwc,"How do you deal with systems that let players know future events?Many systems have one form or another that, if RPGs were a book, would be knowledge of the future that is *going* to happen. But in RPGs even what we as the DM expect to happen may end up being wildly wrong. Most systems account for this with unreliable gods telling lies, or the future being flexible, but I find both of those really unsatisfying both as a DM and as a player. 

So I was curious how you all handle situations where you need to give the players information that in reality may change. 

Have you ever fudged rolls to make a prophecy come true (outside of mechanics for this purpose, like portent in 5e)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3ezwc/how_do_you_deal_with_systems_that_let_players/,"['You need to decide how fungible the future is.

If they don\'t change the ""now"" then there is no reason for me to fudge anything as the driving line of my backlit will just continue along towards where I had planned.', 'I think much of it would depend on player buy-in, the specifics of the system (in some, not all cases), and how much detail we\'re talking here.\n\nI\'ll put this in context of *Blades in the Dark* and its flashback mechanics:\n\n&gt;The players are working the lock to the jewelry store\'s backdoor. A bluecoat comes whistling around the corner and the GM asks, ""What do you do?""\n\nIn Blades, the players are able to flashback and do a thing. They might have to roll for it, and/or spend Stress (a currency in this game that is limited), but one thing is certain: *they cannot change the fact that a police officer (bluecoat) rounded the corner*. So that\'s simple, right? A flashback to pay off the bluecoat to look the other way. If they fail? Then the consequences of failing in the past cannot interfere with them being at the jewelers in the present. \n\nSo, then, I think that\'s point number one: That consequences of failure or success must take some sort of form that is enabling a future event that will happen regardless.\n\nAnother point then is placing the stakes elsewhere or making the story about something else. If at the beginning of the game the Cleric receives the vision of the Kingdom burning and sundered, and the future in this game is certain, the story needs to become about something else. It could be about preparing for what comes after. It could be a romance where he renounces his position in the Order to go and be with his one true love before the world ends. The story then becomes a ""will they, won\'t they"" kind of thing and the stakes is simply finding love.\n\nAll that circles back to player buy-in, IMO. It can be a fun thing to draw an outline of a map and fill in the blank spots together, but only if the group is into it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;', 'If we\'re playing to find out what happens in the game, it makes prophecy or other ""this thing will happen"" stuff a little tougher.\n\nHowever, as long as you\'re broad enough with it it\'s alright. Maybe the prophecy foretells doom coming from the sky. Make yourself a countdown clock or whatever, and that thing is coming. Now it\'s up to the players to figure out what they have to do to stop it, or whatever else.\n\nThe future should never be set in stone. Because you don\'t know what\'s going to happen yet that could change it.', 'If there\'s any sort of precision I tend to go with a prediction of what the outcome most likely would\'ve been BEFORE the character(s) received the knowledge of the future.  But now that they have this knowledge, the outcome without a doubt will become messed up.  Overall though I do not force the predicted outcome to become true, but I do tell the truth about what I think is most likely to happen given their current route and behavior and any other unseen factors that I know about.\n\nIf going with a more classic prophecy...just keep it vague like real prophecies.  And never ever tell the players ""the truth"" behind the prophecy if there ever was one.  Prophecies and portents work when the players convince themselves that they have met the conditions and they are witnessing the outcome as stated.\n\nI did once use a Future Sight as an accidental checkpoint which is about as accurate of future prediction as you can get.  A player cast Augury from ADnD which normally just gives a Good/Bad/Maybe answer.  Anyway we play for like another 6 hours after that spell was cast...the party TPKs.  I notice an error on my end that lead to the TPK, so I just undo it all by turning to the cleric and saying ""And you awake from your dream of the future!""  My group remembers it as the Quick-Save Augury Spell.']"
rpg,t3_a3ez2p,"How ""serious"" is Delta Green?I'll start with a bit of preface.  A while ago I GM'd a Call of Cthulhu game with some friends.  It was basically all our first time.  We played through The Haunting, and since everyone was new I kept it a little ""light hearted"".  The group was made up of a politician, his secretary, and a hobo.  The person who played the politician role played beautifully, and gave the guy a massively inflated ego who touted his power everywhere he went.  I basically had to keep him in check when he tried barging into a police station like he owned the place by throwing him in the ""slammer"" temporarily.  The hobo proceeded to break into the station through a side door to get to the files the group needed, and ignored the politician to let him ""cool off"". Then when the group eventually got to the house, he was the one I lured to the bedroom where he failed the roll, fell out the window and the old man broke his hip :)  They all seemed to have a lot of fun and thoroughly enjoyed the game.

So much so, that recently they asked for a follow up game (along with 2 new players).  Now here's where my question comes in.  I more recently read the rules to Delta Green and really liked the way the rolls were a little more stream lined, and the modern setting it creates.

My question is, with the addition of bonds, and more ""bleak"" mechanics, does Delta Green still lend itself for some leeway and hijinx? 

Thanks for the responses!

First, I am confused by one aspect of the GUMSHOE system and second I am looking for general advice as a first time GM!Sorry for a post so lacking in substance! I cannot seem to find the answer though - neither in the book nor via googling! I am reading through The Kingsbury Horror and there are a few stability tests. For example, ""Examining the picture closely enough to identify the relief creates a strong sensation of being watched, along with vertigo and a powerful onrush of déjà vu, for a 2-point Stability test.""

Does this mean that the difficulty of the stability test is two? Or that failing the test incurs a loss of two stability from the investigators pool?

Also, in an attempt to add a bit more substance to this post, does anyone have any tips for a first-time GM running Trail of Cthulhu? Or GUMSHOE in general? The players are all new to RPG with the exception of one, who played D&amp;D years ago in his youth, but hasn't done in over a decade. Also we are not set on The Kingsbury Horror - I could acquire other books if they might be a more exciting first experience for us!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3edmi/i_am_preparing_to_play_trail_of_cthulhu_with/,"['Stability tests normally have a difficulty of 4; difficulty is 5 if the event involved the Mythos. So in this case they would have to roll a 4 or better or lose 2 points of Stability.', 'I would suggest a different first adventure than The Kingsbury Horror. Newer adventures have improved presentation making them easier to run. ', ""Yeah, unless you're a massive classicist or a huge fan of Chicago, I'd not bother with Kingsbury Horror.  You can likely find a few smaller adventures for free online — *The Murderer of Thomas Fell* is an old convention module and plays well as a single or double session story.\n\n\nI've written a three session jaunt around London if locked room mysteries and tube staff bureaucracy are up your street "", 'Some of my first time GM tips.\n\nStart the session with a small talk with the players (did you have a session 0?). Are they also new to the hobby? Decide if you rather would focus on story or learning the rules. The first requires the players to trust you more and gives you the freedom/horror of winging it but is what I recommend if everyone are first timers. When it gets to that, stay calm and try to stick to the story. Remember that you can always ask the players for advice or a short break. For beginners, I think I would rather rule in favour of a PC than against them.\n\nIf you\'re taking the rules path, be prepared to stall the game. Make a player keep the rulebook, or a tablet w PDF-version (you\'ll get the PDF free if you mail Pelgrane w a receipt). Then you\'ll get time to go through your notes while they do the work. If you want the rules look-uper (eldritch term ;) can rotate between the players.\n\nOn horror: it does not work (as far as I have experienced). But tension sure does. When the characters start too feel it, start limiting information to the players. Don\'t be specific (e.g. ""you hear footsteps on the floor above"") instead try to give the players exactly what the characters get (e.g. ""you hear the floor boards above you squeek across the room""). Go by the least significant dominator, i.e. let the player that is in least chance of harm act or respond, and try to guess what happens around them. If two players split into each room, one empty and one with a monster, the empty rooms start. That character will hear screams and roars from the second room. Don\'t switch to that player until you really need to be able to find out what happened, e.g. first player runs out and goes into the second room. Until that happens, just assume natural responses, monster eats characters or character escapes and is pursued by monster. And then when you switch you stitch together the information you gave and what the second player does. In this case: 1st PC hears screams but waits. Screams moves out to previous corridor followed by growls and loud thumps. 1st PC waits until everything is silent, doesn\'t take a minute, and then look back in corridor. Switch to 2nd PC when entering room and sees monster. Tries to escape but fails and is killed in room. Instead of paradox: character escapes into corridor, is killed and then dragged away by monster.\n\nI also like to stop talking to players when they are dead/uncossious. As long as I know for sure, no matter if they know it yet, I don\'t speak to them. Can be tricky with newbies though. But this gives you the tool to really draw out a switch and build up anxiety within the group. If a player doesn\'t get to act for several minutes they assume they are dead, and so does the others, but then you switch to them and everything is fine. You know it\'s working when a player decides to go back and check on someone else, even without any tells that they may be hurt. Or if another begs them to check on their character.\n\nAnd the most important thing: have fun :) Good luck!', ""I'm a longtime GUMSHOE enthusiast who's strangely never gotten to play or run ToC.\n\nFor general advice: [GUMSHOE 101](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsite.pelgranepress.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2013%2F09%2FGUMSHOE-101-for-Players-and-GMs.pdf)\n\nSpecifically: That's a difficulty 4 test with a failure cost of 2.\n\nIf you want to emphasize the pulp, I'd go with something from Stunning Eldritch Tales, it's very well received.

rpg,t3_a3e9bo,"rpgs where the PCs are actors in a show/moviehi there -   


I'd like to run a short campaign with my group in which they play actors working on a tv show or movie set, where we would work collaboratively to develop the premise of the tv show/movie and play out certain scenes, but also have 'off-camera' moments and character motivations that have an affect on the production. For example: perhaps there are some strange events happening off camera, like a haunted set, which the characters have to deal with while also still fulfilling their acting duties. 

  
I've looked into Primetime Adventures, and while the structure for setting up the tv show is solid, it seems like the Screen Presence, Budget and Fan Mail mechanics are as close as it gets to describing the actual production of your TV show itself, and they are all pretty simple and not particularly character driven. 

Action Movie World is a bit closer as there is a distinction between the PC's character and the role they are playing, but it's, of course, extremely action oriented and would be pretty hard to use most of the playbooks for any other genre. 

World Wide Wrestling seems to be the closest thing I've found, as it actually has mechanics and a structure for things happening off-camera that affect the things happening on-camera - but I'm wondering how well it would translate to just being a straight-up TV show rather than a wrestling show.   


So now I'm considering a kind of mashup - using the TV Show generating mechanics of Primetime, but adding playbooks and off-camera stuff based on a 'de-wrestlerized' World Wide Wrestling. 

Alternatively, maybe a simpler option would be a PBTA game where the player characters happen to be actors, with no specific mechanics involved for how that works - for example, a near-modern day version of The Veil where all the PCs work as actors on a show.   


Are there any systems I've missed? Or does anyone have experience running a game with this kind of 'two level' structure?   


Many thanks!

rpg,t3_a3d0ys,"35-minute draft of Secrets of Blackmoor, on the origins of roleplayingThere is now a 35-minute draft preview that has been release publicly of the upcoming Secrets of Blackmoor documentary:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC4qH-Psvpc

Previously this was only shown at Gary Con X, earlier this year. The final documentary will have a different voice-over and be much longer. If you are interested in the early history of D&amp;D or early history of roleplaying games, it may interest you.

The documentary is about the original Blackmoor game of the early 1970s, and how the first roleplaying games developed out of the wargames played by the Twin Cities group in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Much of it started with the search for more realistic wargame rules. At the time, they were stuck with simple Avalon Hill games, which were not good realistic enough for Twin Cities wargamers. Then they discovered the military wargame book Strategos (1880), which was based on guidelines for military wargame simulations in the 19th century.

The group then developed their own theories and systems (e.g. ""Strategos N"") based off what they learned, using a referee to settle all disputes (i.e. game master), taking to heart the Strategos idea that players ""should be able to attempt anything, although not always successfully."" They played in scenarios in which players took on the personas of different townspeople in Napoleonic (Braunstein), Wild West (Brownstone), and medieval fantasy (Blackmoor) settings.

Eventually there was a cross-pollination of ideas between the Twin Cities group and the Lake Geneva group, and Dave and Gary became friends. After playing in Dave Arneson's Blackmoor campaign, Gary and Dave agreed to work together to codify and publish the game. Both Dave and Gary were credited as authors of the game. This became the original Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974). Interestingly, the Blackmoor campaigns forked and continued to be played for decades with their own style, and with original players and some new ones.

There are also some interesting anecdotes from Bob Meyer, who referees Blackmoor games and is one of the original players:

rpg,t3_a3cql5,"Subsistence AdventuringDo any of you know about a resource for ""subsistence adventuring"" as in adventuring to live. 

I'm thinking of the tone set by Torchbearer, but for D&amp;D 5E (or system-agnostic). ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3cql5/subsistence_adventuring/,"['No resources, but this is something I’ve been thinking about a bit lately (dig back through my post history for the one about cost of living expenses and you’ll see the start of it). I think it largely comes down to making sure your adventures provide the PCs with just enough money to get by for a little while *but no more*. My thinking currently runs like this:\n\n1. Decide on a good cadence (i.e., how often they should have to go adventuring to keep in food and shelter). Let’s say you want them to go adventuring about once a month. This gives them a good number of adventures while still providing them with ample downtime to heal, craft, pursue personal interests, and carouse about town.\n2. Figure out how much money they need to survive for one period (one month in this case). How much will they spend on lodging, food, materials, upkeep, entertainment, etc.?\n3. Design your adventures to provide roughly that much income: a little bit more if you want them to be able to advance in society, a little less if you want to keep them lean and desperate. Magic items are a bit tricky here. Some they’ll sell and some they’ll keep; the ones they sell could upset the balance, so be careful to either factor that in or focus on magic items they’re likely to keep and use. \n\nThe key here is the downtime expenses (hence the previous post). The rules provided are pretty rudimentary and may suffice, but they’re kind of designed to make downtime as burdenless as possible. For this to work I kind of think you need them to be a significant portion of the game (not a majority, just enough to feel like something the PCs actually need to think about and manage). You also need to think a bit about where they’re spending their downtime and ways to invest them in exploring and developing that, which is to say: how to get them to care about their town and work to establish themselves in it.', 'Not sure if this is what you are looking for but check out, Do Not Let Us Die In The Dark Night Of This Cold Winter.\n\nAlso are you looking for something very detailed or something that\'s easy to track but substantial?  For example I lifted a simple supply system in which the party just tracks ""Supplies"" which is a handwave term for everything you need to survive and adventure - food, water, weapon oil, toilet paper, really anything appropriate to the game...   And you measure supplies in Days.  So it makes it very easy for the players to wrap their heads around it and track in a meaningful way that feeds into their gameplay decisions.  Then you can use Supplies both reward and punishment.  They raid a camp and collect 6 Days of Supplies.  They stumble around lost in the woods, losing 2 days supplies.  They lend assistance to the village losing 20 days of supply...  That sort of thing.   If they reach 0 supplies they die.  For a less abrupt end, it can be something like, you cannot recover HP at 0 Supplies.  Overall though, I find that for a subsistence adventure simple works best.', '[I’ll pitch my own work](https://www.incunabuli.com/2017/08/adventure-capital.html) based on professional adventuring. \nEdit: Also, system agnostic and prose-y.', ""Well, I just picked up **Mothership** from Tuesday Knight Games, one a nice design element is that owning a spaceship is *expensive.* Every 20 square meters of ship costs 10 million credits. As such, the players are generally always in debt, driving them to make money any way they can to stave off whoever they owe. It's a different kind of subsistence, but keep it in mind. "", ""The new Warhammer Fantasy edition that just came out has some rules for downtime that might be interesting for this. There's a bunch of activities people can partake in during downtime, one activity per week. Once the downtime's over any money earned from the last adventure is gone unless they stored/banked it and they'll have to adventure again. It could give a good rhythm of earning just enough to get by and then having to go out again that it sounds like you were looking for."", ""You will need mechanics changes as well as setting. At the core of a subsistence or low resource game would be making resources matter.\n\n1) a functional, simple and restrictive encumberance system.  I recommend 1 useful item per point of STR, but there are others.\n\n2) a system for starvation and food needs. One that provides bonuses as well as penalties to discourage stockpiling.\n\n3) advancement mechanics, likely an XP structure, that disfavor heroic combat v. balanced opponents and favors grubbing for resources.\n\n4) likely something that makes troupe play work. Probably long-term wounds.\n\n5) a modification of the 5e HP economy so that PCs Don't enter most situations at full power, but instead slowly deplete resources.\n\nA GM can build a great setting, evocative of a playstyle, but without supporting mechanics it won't get you to that playstyle alone.  This is especially true if the play ethos that the players know is different."", 'You’re fighting the system, because that’s very much not what D&amp;D is about. It’s not about scarcity, and changing that core assumption is going to have ripples we’re not even considering yet.\n\nTry Forbidden Lands,which should be available this week.', 'https://youtu.be/OkHapG6kXUg\n\nBasically the moral of the story is limiting  and tracking resources is the key to making a survival game different from normal play. ', 'I think this is called being a Mercenary.', ""Don't really have resources for you, but my advice is:\n\nFirst and foremost: require that they have dependants. Wife, children, elderly. People who either can't help or can't be risked in such dangerous work. People to raise expenses by 5-10 times over. People to get ill and need expensive medicine. People that they want to give a good quality of life to. \n\nSecond, look into haveing some aspect of your wider setting give an excess of manpower on the area so there just aren't stable jobs. Maybe a recently concluded war has caused professional soldiers to be short on soldiering. Or more people displaced on the same manner as the PCs, or an existing nomadic or itinerant culture. Add onto this a heavy 'out of toweners tax' and general hostility to itinerant workers.\n\nFor some fiction for ideas, I suggest some Steinbeck, specifically Of Mice and Men and Grapes of Wrath. Especially the latter, there are likely some parallels between your PCs, their families and their situation and that of the Joads.\n\nIf you can find it, Sharpe's Justice is well worth watching if you want to include the postwar angle. "", 'It\'s not fantasy but Red Markets is all about this. It\'s tagline is ""Red Markets is a game of economic horror, where the world has ended and the rent is still due."" Gameplay revolves around mercenaries leaving their families in the safety of their enclaves to find supplies and stuff to trade for food. (and dependants are a constant drain on resources but help with the stress of fighting zombies and robots and insane people for a living)', 'Barbarians of Lemuria abstracts wealth and living expenses, and then has you basically blow all your found treasure at the end of your adventure in order to advance your character (a boisterous fighter might blow it all on ale and carousing, which increases his reputation, while a studious scholar might spend it all on rare books to increase his knowledge, etc.). The GM awards advancement points (like XP) based on what you did and if you state that you were a miser and spent nothing you get fewer advancement points. Since wealth is so abstract in the game, most people just describe their character as spending all of it.', ""Blades in the Dark has an element of this. Coin is one of the resources a crew never has enough of; pick safer scores and you don't earn much, but going after riskier, more lucrative scores can wind up costing you more than you make as you're forced to buy off heat and spend for additional downtime actions to recover from a job gone sideways. It ends up being a literal risk-vs-reward balancing act if the crew wants to make enough money to actually grow.\n\nNot sure how much direct use that is to you, as it sounds like you're after something much more granular, but you might be able to borrow some ideas from it."", 'Less a resource and more a useful ""trick""; the resources on-hand for financial transactions and even straight barter might be useless in a given region.  \n\n-\n\nAll your coins are minted with the face of the king this secessionist archipelago hates utterly.  They won\'t kill you for having it in your pocket but you won\'t be able to buy anything with it directly.  Even the smithy won\'t give you more than 20% raw value for the metal itself.  Clearing out the local goblin den will at least get you a few weeks lodging in someone\'s barn while you try to figure out how the hell to get out of here.', ""5E isn't really the right system for it. The economy is 5E's weak point.\n\nI would suggest checking out Forbidden Lands when it's properly out.""]"

However, I feel like the ""problem"" with crunchy games in the story vs crunch spectrum, is that you have to do so book keeping for the crunchy rules.

rpg,t3_a3asfw,"Does Stars Without Number have too much of an old school feel?What I ask concerns the math mostly. Does it behave like OD&amp;D where +3 is the best you have and failed rolls mess you big time?

I've skimmed the book and the current resurgence of sci-fi interest on this subreddit got me hyped, but the system seems not streamlined enough to me. SWN seems the perfect fit for what I want, i.e. Dune or Hyperion style campaign, but the numerical progression seems underwhelming and by virtue of having d20 - too swingy. Also, are there any cons to skill rolls being 2d6, i.e. not using an universal mechanic?

How does it feel in actual play?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3asfw/does_stars_without_number_have_too_much_of_an_old/,"[""&gt;What I ask concerns the math mostly.

The reason for the rule, I would assume, is precisely to make skill rolls less swingy. Since attack bonus advances with level, it will increase quicker than a skill bonus, thus motivating a larger die. "", 'old school feel is intended.\n\nBut think about this, combat rolls use a swingy d20 while skills use a steady 2d6.\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nCombat is a chaotic, dangerous and unpredictable thing to happen for everyone involved.\n\nIt means that savy players will consider combat a less prefferable way to overcome things, and use more interesting ways.\n\nedit: spelling', ""Overall feels good.  Combat is chaotic which your group may dislike.  This is purposeful as the intent is that combat is generally unpredictable and dangerous so great consideration needs to be used before leveraging violence.  However the Warrior class gets an auto-hit or auto-miss (enemy's attack) once per combat.  This is extremely useful especially since most things die in one hit.  The part that reminds me of ODnD is that combat runs incredibly fast and allows for more roleplay solutions because of how simple the fighting mechanics are.\n\n2d6 for Skills makes it less swingy.  Also it makes bonuses have diminishing returns, considering that most skill checks should have a DC of 8 (average).  This can encourage players to not just pump all skill points into 1 or 2 skills.\n\nThere is also a Heroic Variant in the full game.  The Heroic variant gives the game more like well...a high heroics feel.  It changes the mechanics slightly to mitigate failure for mundane activities.  For example a heroic warrior instantly hits lesser foes.  So this would be good for running something like a fancy Star Wars style game where really it's a story about the big time Heroes and Villains, not of Rebel Soldier Bob or Tie Fighter Pilot Alpha Two"", '""too much"" is obviously entirely subjective. But I\'ve been playing it for a few months and enjoying it. It honestly feels like it gives a lot of advantages to the players, especially after they\'ve gotten a few levels, but my character is mostly skill-based and we don\'t get into combat much, so I\'m sure that has a large part to do with it, since combat is the more unpredictable and chaotic part of it.\n\nBonuses are small, but small bonuses make a big difference on 2d6, and a lot of focuses give a bonus *and* let you roll 3d6 and take the best 2 in a given skill (or you can take the focus that lets you roll that with any skill), *and* being an Expert means you have more skill points *and* get one free reroll on skills per scene... so, as someone playing an Expert that fixes and hacks, I feel like it\'s pretty hard for me to fail unless I\'m rolling a lot of very hard checks in a row. And that\'s before getting into building my own equipment to give me myself more bonuses.\n\nCombat, of course is more swingy but everybody has an attack bonus that increases with their level, Warriors have a bigger bonus *and* they get one free auto-hit per combat, so they also have more control in their domain. And Psychics, naturally, aren\'t as extremely specialized but they have powers that break the game in other ways, like teleporting right next to someone and attacking them in melee range where they can\'t fight back with a ranged weapon.\n\nOf course, if we had more, and deadlier, combat encounters, it would feel a lot different, but since you\'re asing if everything is too chaotic and dangerous, I guess the answer is it doesn\'t have to be - we don\'t get into deadly combat much because a) we avoid it in situations where we would be grossly outgunned (ie talking to political leaders with bodyguards, dealing with corrupt local authorities), and b) when we\'re in combat-heavy situations like a dungeon/station-crawl, the GM doesn\'t put overwhelming force in any one room, and we proceed cautiously and with a drone scout so we\'re prepared and can heal between fights.', ""Whether or not it has too much of an old school feel is going to be dependent on each individual playing it. \n\nFor me personally, while I absolutely love the sector/planet generation and basically everything to do with the GM side of the game, I don't really love the game itself. \n\nI tend to prefer either narrative focused games (Apocalypse World, Blades in the Dark, etc.) or if I'm going for a turn based combat game I generally want something with more fleshed out character advancement (modern D&amp;D, etc.)"", 'You can watch it played here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-oTJHKXHicQ0jv37mr8D9kRFXox7-PXD\n\nAnd a different campaign of 2e here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-oTJHKXHicRE1O4DJVOkFTcqA0VNVU9J']"
rpg,t3_a3are8,"My players will soon enter a town where a false hydra rests underneath. Can you give me some tips?Party of 4. Half-Elf Summoner/Eidolon, Fallen Aasimar Fighter, Tiefling Mystic and a Furbolg Druid. They are all Level 9.

They are going to the town with purpose: the Baron that hired the team essentially received a letter from his cousin in the town, where in between the lines of gossip and other ongoings were the hastily scribbled word ""HELP US"" written in blood.

The False Hydra has had 3 weeks to feed as the party has made their journey to the town. It is now at 9 heads. It will reach critical mass at 15. One of the victims was the Baron's cousin. Some things I'm thinking of doing:

a) When they arrive, I will make sure to have the Lavender town theme playing constantly. Maybe one of the spooky remixes. It will only go off once during the session, indicating that the Hydra has stopped singing to feed. I will not mention why I have removed the music of course and simply put it back on later without saying anything should the players ask.

b) OOCly, I will display on the TV (they have a Telly in the room we're playing) the population of the town. I'm thinking that once the music comes back on and when the party is busy talking, I will reduce the number by 1 and see if anyone notices.

c) I plan to let the party investigate through the town as they desire. I've already established the major NPCs and such and overall things are going as normal, though there is a malaise in the air.

The problem I'm thinking and need tips on is how to clue them in on things being wrong. The first and most important lead is the cousin being missing and nobody remembering of him - but then what? What else would you suggest? I was pondering that maybe some animals are missing. Or that horses refuse to enter the town, etc.

I recently found myself watching a seminar on indie RPGs at UK con Dragonmeet and on that panel, the concept of GM-less collaborative RPGs was drafted around.

I’m playing around with a concept that walks this line currently myself, but I keep running into the question of whether it’s actually a collaborative storytelling tabletop game, or an RPG, or if there’s actually a difference?

Is there something intrinsic to having a GM, who creates a world which characters play roles in, or is roleplaying a matter of approaching a ruleset by choosing to add improv and acting? I’m sure we’ve all played games with people who are more into mechanics and level ups that they are actually playing the role, and vice-versa and I certainly approach other tabletop games with a roleplaying element, just because it makes for a less combative and rules heavy game night for me.

So what do you think? Is there a difference and how do you define it?

Tl;dr: how do you define each of these and do you feel there’s a difference?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a3a43c/where_do_you_draw_the_line_between_collaborative/,"['I would organize the continuum around the amount of narrative authority players get.\n\nSuppose six writers show up to work in the Star Trek the Next Generation writer\'s room.  One of them has a rough idea for an episode and the writers bandy about ideas for cool things that could happen in that framework, neat things different characters could do and so on.  Over a few hours they bang out a plot, some character beats, some dialog, and a thrilling conclusion.  That isn\'t a role playing game, it\'s writing.  Being collaborative doesn\'t make it an RPG, it\'s just collaborative writing.\n\nSuppose on another extreme some wargamers play out a Star Trek miniatures skirmish combat.  There are strict rules about where you can move, what you can see, what dice you have to roll to hit, and so on, and (importantly) what each sides objectives are (""victory goes to whoever gets the most victory points, the Federation player gets 1 vp for X, 2 vp for Y, etc..."")  That isn\'t a role playing game either any more than Chess is.\n\nI\'ve played in things calling themselves role playing games pretty close to each of those extremes, and I don\'t think it is terribly helpful to use a single term to refer to both.\n\nThe trouble with the writer\'s room (in my mind) is that the participants have too much narrative control.  A writer can say ""Wouldn\'t it be cool if the ruins turned out to be Ferengi and we learned something interesting about the ancient Ferengi that cast modern Ferengi in a new light"".  That is an option a Star Trek writer has, it isn\'t an option \\*Picard\\* has though and it changes the experience of playing \\*Picard\\* to be simultaneously considering not just ""What would Picard think and feel and do in this situation"" but also ""What would be good for the story"".  People sometimes invoke ""Oh, in an RPG you only play one character"" but I don\'t think that\'s it.  If Patrick Stewart\'s contract were really good and had a provision that said the writer\'s room had to have a writer who\'s only job was coming up with cool stuff for Picard to do each episode it wouldn\'t turn the project into an RPG.\n\nWhat makes RPGs fun, at least for me, is the extent to which Picard\'s player is in the same position as Picard.  Picard doesn\'t have a say in who made those ruins he\'s investigating, he has to try to puzzle things out on his own.  That requires a GM who has secret information, unshared authority to declare the origin of the ruins, and so on.  I\'ve played in story games where I have felt a real disconnect from my character because I\'m just not in his position anymore, I\'m more like some patron God manipulating a mortal to make a good morality tale.  I want to play Hercules, not Zeus.  The fun, at least sometimes, is fully putting yourself in Picard\'s shoes so that you can vicariously experience the adventure along with him.  Too much narrative control gets in the way of that, Picard can be nervous walking into ruins, a script writer can\'t be, but a player in an RPG can but only \\*because he doesn\'t control the outcome\\*.\n\nThe trouble with the miniatures war game is that you are locked into too narrow a set of options.  The game tells you what winning is and the social contract says we all should play to our win conditions.  Chess is a math problem, not a role playing game, to become role playing you need to start assigning inner lives to the participants and making decisions based on those inner lives.  Redshirt number 3 might be sacrificed for 2 victory points, but Yeoman Harris might decide he\'s not dying for Star Fleet today and flee, then try to make a life for himself as a deserter on the run.  \n\nI\'ve played in bad rail roads that might as well be miniatures wargame scenarios.  In a war game you might say ""We\'re setting up side A and side B and then playing out the battle"" and the game is the tactical maneuvering of your pieces in accordance with the mechanics.  A putative RPG where the players have to move down the rails having encounter after encounter as described in the model feels very similar.

These roles are conventionally characters, but the concept of roles could be broad enough to include societies, institutions, civilizations, etc.\n\nThe GM is one role that a player can assume in the game, but in my opinion, that role isn\'t necessary for a game to be a game.

There are thousands of attempts made to place such a line every year, all in different spots. \n\nIt's much more productive to look at attributes that are common in the centers of these fuzzy clouds rather than trying to artificially impose borders."", 'Genres are social constructs. \n\nFrom a top down sense, they are for marketing (if you like this Fiasco, you’ll love Microscope! If you like Hero you’ll love GURPS!). Me saying this is not a denigration of marketing. For those of you old enough to remember record stores, genres made it easier to find new music similar to what you already liked. If all the music was organized alphabetically, that wouldn’t be all that helpful. But if you went to Amoeba and walked over to their Celtic Punk Rock section, you’d find stuff that was  subdivided in a way that would be useful for what you were hoping to find. On the negative side, things that don’t easily fit within the marketing category of genre often get overlooked.\n\nFrom a bottom up sense, they are about community and identity. People often identify with the things they love and they create community around this things they love and that will often manifest as genre. I’m a story gamer. I’m a Simulationist. I’m a Goth. I’m a retro gamer. This self identification is important to people and the communities they find fellowship. Having the genre allows you to find others like yourself to have community with. For example, I identify as a gamer. That means I am a person who plays the subgenre of games called RPGs. This is part of my identity and this label allows me to find other gamers. On a large scale this was the only label I needed during the Satanic Panic. I didn’t need subdivisions of the genre RPG because we were all being attacked from the outside. As time has gone on, subdivisions of the community have become more meaningful and they describe their differences with genre. Maybe it becomes meaningful to call yourself a story gamer to find others like you who want to play like you do. Maybe you describe yourself as a Method Actor player or a Tactician. Maybe you identify as an OSR gamer, or Narrativist. Or a sandbox gamer. Or any other number of labels. On the negative side, drawing these boundaries to help you find community also is a form of gatekeeping that excludes others.\n\nAnd all of this is arbitrary. \n\nThe other thing about genre is that it can be interesting to study on an academic level. It is what I do for my job. As a Musicologists, I look at the arguments surrounding if this piece is Ambient or Illbient, if that thing is a musical or an opera, if that this is art music or pop music—or any other number of distinctions that matter a lot to people. I’m looking not because I’m trying to find some truth about whether the Beatles *really* are Pop or Rock...because I actually don’t care. Because genres are arbitrary and changing and really not all that interesting. But I look because it is interesting that people care about this and they argue and fight. Those fights don’t tell us anything meaningful about The Beatles, they tell us something meaningful about people—which is what I tend to care about.\n\nSo what is the difference between a story game and an RPG is not an interesting question to me on some literal sense. The line between will be drawn differently if you like story games than if you don’t. If you like story games and you like an edge case, you are more likely to define your boundaries in such a way to include that one...of you don’t like storygames and you like there same edge case, you are more likely to define your boundaries in such a way to include that same one.\n\nWhat is interesting is that this is a debate we are having at this point in our community. That people will fight about this. That they use these terms to find community that is meaningful to them, or use them to demean and exclude. There are games made over 20 years ago that would fall under current definitions of storygame, but that was not a meaningful genre term for people at the time, so people didn’t argue that. They argued over other terms.\n\nI personally see storygames as a subgenre of RPG, which I see as a large umbrella term comprising of lots of styles and subgenre. What those subgenre and styles are are nebulous and changing like all genres and styles. \n\nI’m happy for everyone to do their thing. But I encourage people to remember that behind genres are people who identify with that genre as part of their identity. So erased or denigrating some genre is erasing and denigrating people who identify Witt that genre. So...don’t do that.', ""I don't bother making such a broad distinction.

But games like Fiasco or Hillfolk swing hard towards the story pole. Most PBtA games are less close, but still closer to the story side of things. Games like Shadowrun and many editions of DnD are closer to the other end of the pole.\n\nPerhaps concurrent to this pole is another, namely preplanned vs playing to find out. Most games use a combination of the two. No game is entirely preplanned (well, hopefully not). But games closer to the story pole tend also to forego much planning, and sometimes require none at all.\n\nThese spectrums might not be perfectly defined (games super close to the story end of the spectrum could in theory have lots of rules, though I haven't found this to be the case).

Gameplay is non-linear across a timeline.\n\nHowever, Microscope does *have* characters. The most important details of a character are recorded as part of the game.

These are not universal, but they\'re the way I interpret things:  \n1) Collaborative Storytelling = a group of people telling a story together. There may be some kind of rules system or referee involved to ensure consistency among storytellers, but this is not required.\n\n2) Roleplaying = Taking on a role other than your role in real life for the purpose of entertainment. This might be a specific character (Maxwell the agorophobic accountant who dislikes pears and loves heavy metal), an archetype (a flamboyent, scheming nobleman) or even just a simple role (dude who explores dangerous places for a living).\n\n3) Game = a challenge normally undertaken for the purpose of entertainment. This basically means that in order to qualify as a game, there must be an objective, and it must be possible to fail this objective. (Note that it\'s trivial to turn anything into a game. A book is a game if you add an objective ""read it all"".)\n\nSo basically - roleplaying in the context of tabletop RPGs is generally a subset of collaborative storytelling And either of these can be games, depending on whether or not the players have an objective. (In a collaborative storytelling game, the aim is generally to try and tell the story you want to tell. In an RPG, the aim is generally for your character to lead a successful life).', ""I think a GAME requires the presence of a challenge that is outside the control of the players (unless they happen to be playing against each other, in which case they introduce challenges)\n\nUsually that's the GM. You could invent a GM-less system that relies on randomization; cards, dice, spinners etc... which introduce challenges.

Campfire Storytelling on one end and Boardgame on the other.  RPGs just slot in somewhere in the middle.\n\nFor me most collaborative storytelling games don\'t have much of a system and that\'s their primary feature.  Personally I just wouldn\'t even call it a game but rather an improvisation exercise.  There\'s no winning or losing, the challenge is just in creating this story together.  My favorite storytelling game doesn\'t have a formal name that I know of, but it\'s where everyone goes around in turn speaking one word trying to not only develop a cohesive story around a topic, but also maintain a cohesive voice.  I first encountered that exercise in an improvisation comedy class.  It was the warmup exercise to help teams ""synch up"" their minds.\n\nWhereas an RPG I think of as a game where there\'s winning and losing even though it may not be a hard win/fail state.  There\'s now restrictions placed on what can be invented and there are challenges whether devised by a GM or by the game itself that can be overcome with some combination of roleplay and system.  The exact mix of the Roleplay and System will determine where along the spectrum this rpg falls.  And this too can change within the same game.  Just using DnD as the example, a group that runs strictly RAW and allows nothing else would be close to the boardgame end of the spectrum.  But a group that empowers more roleplaying and allows bending of the rules around that roleplaying, that\'s closer to collaborative storytelling.', ""Player decisions must impact the story to whatever extent possible.

There is no game mechanic that addresses the player qua player with no tie to the perspective of the character in the imaginary reality. Obviously the mechanics can be quite abstract, but they are representing forces or processes that the character would recognize, even if they are more simplified than the actual rules of physics in the imaginary reality would indicate. The play, then, is to immerse yourself in the role of that character: the mechanical inputs and outputs correspond to the actual experience of the character, so what benefits the player benefits the character, and vice versa. So physical/mental attributes, health bars, skill lists, and, most importantly, relatively exclusive control over the actions and decisions of one character are the hallmarks of role-playing games.\n\nA collaborative storytelling game is one where the mechanics are about authoring what happens next in a story. The mechanics mediate the authors\' control over the narrative. In a ""pure"" storytelling game, no characters would be assigned to anyone, all would be shared fairly through the exercise of the mechanics. Introducing a dramatic complication for the characters rewards the player, such that the mechanics incentivize, to one degree or another, the player giving setbacks to the characters they author. The game here is not immersion in any character\'s perspective, it is playing as an author. So meta-currencies, mechanics that give players control over what happens *to* a character (as opposed to what the character proactively does), and mechanics that give players control over world details totally untethered to their character are evidence that you\'re playing a collaborative storytelling game.\n\nMost of the games we\'re talking about are hybrids: most are fundamentally RPGs where you control the actions of one character that is mechanically represented by objective stats, a health bar, etc. But they blend in some CSG mechanics like meta-currencies, GM compels, or player-elected setbacks (often to earn a meta-currency).\n\nI, for one, feel the difference when I step out of my character\'s head and step into the author\'s chair for a moment when I engage with those CSG mechanics. I\'m not saying it\'s a bad thing: I am just as grateful for meta-currencies that allow me to prevent my character\'s death as much as the next guy, but it is a gear switch.\n\nCan you do a GM-less RPG and still be an RPG? I would say yes: either you pre-script the world such that players don\'t have to take actions outside of their characters (much), or different players step out of their characters a bit and play the opposition somehow a la Shadows Over Camelot. It won\'t be a ""pure"" RPG, but there are very few of those around these days anyway. So long as the core mechanics are that you generally play one character represented by objective stats and such, you hit the RPG wickets at least enough to be a hybrid, at least according to one rando on the internet, even if you do step out of that regularly to play the opposition somehow.\n\n', ""For me, it's simply a matter of either Roleplaying or Storytelling.

The setting must feel ""real"", it must have substance so that players have to ""push"" against it, otherwise players are not embodying characters but rather composing collaborative fiction. NPCs must have their own agendas, the world must feel like it\'s moving even when players are not looking (even if it\'s all a fiction driven by genre conventions), and there must be unforeseen twists in the story, hidden facts that when revealed make sense because they were present in the story all along, and a narrative tempo and structure that feels right. To me, that means that in a RPG the narrative agency of players must be somewhat limited, and the world in which the story takes place must be embodied by a different player, the GM, with a radically different role and much greater narrative agency.\n\nOn the other hand in storytelling games anything goes, players are not embodying character struggling against hardship but instead striving to deliver the most interesting story possible. Players in a storytelling game are not playing roles, they are not embodying fictional characters, but are instead looking at the story from the outside, like a writer would.\n\nI would definitely classify Microscope, Follow or Lovecraftesque as storytelling games, not RPGs. I\'ve had good times playing them, like I\'ve had good times playing boardgames, but they don\'t give me the deep satisfaction of getting lost in a fictional character in a good RPG session. YMMV.\n\nAs I said it\'s a continuum, and the dividing line is blurry. I absolutely love Fate, which gives players more narrative agency than most RPGs. But for some people it\'s too much, being asked ""do you want this story complication?"" breaks their immersion because from their point of view complications either happen or they don\'t, and characters should have no saying in it. I can understand the people that hate Fate because of this; I find storytelling games unsatisfactory for much the same reasons.', 'For me, the distinction is huge.  An RPG is one where the players only control the actions of their characters, while the GM handles the rest of the universe. A storytelling game is one where the players have any non-trivial control of the narrative/universe aside from their own characters.\n\nI love RPGs, and have no interest in storytelling games. I like improv comedy on its own, and we\'re a funny bunch of RPGers, but storytelling doesn\'t do anything for me.  The thrill of gaming for me is trying to overcome a challenge the GM has put in front of us, using the perspective of my adopted character.  Narrative control erases that challenge.

""Can you believe that time you lost your eye in the first adventure?"" is more meaningful because it was happenstance, not our decision.\n\nAs to the charge of the game being entertaining, or of players being discouraged by failure, we\'ve never experienced that in two decades of gaming. Usually we win, sometimes we lose, but we always have fun. There\'s some behind the scenes GM magic involved there, sure, but a lot of it is just players not basing their happiness on the outcome of the dice. You can still have fun, and entertain your friends, in failure. ', ""I don't see the line.\n\nRPG and storytelling games are technically the same.\n\nRPG stands for Role Playing Game. And Storytelling games intrinsically require you to get into roles to tell the story. They are one and the same in my book.\n\nThe difference you dictate is a gameplay difference that isn't found in the nomeclatur RPG/Storytelling game. As both are so linked to each other the vendiagram has 99% shared space.\n\nThe difference is probably found in another term that has yet to be named (or that I dn't know the name of yet) as we have been seeing a Boom of RPG/Storytelling games.

What do I mean? I mean that you fail in something completely - your attack misses, you don\'t convince someone in the slightest, you crash the ship. You can certain try to avoid this by gaining modifiers or spending in game points to avoid failure and so on but at the end of the day, if you are out of luck, bonuses and points, you should be able to fail an action and not be able to just ignore it.  \n  \nIf you could just ignore it, the stakes are lost (the game part) and you find yourself doing improv instead. ""Well, your attack doesn\'t kill but it hits him in the leg and slows him down?"" That\'s just ""Yes, and..."" in more words.

Characters are customizable and advance in power as they survive challenges\n3. Stories are explored collaboratively and provide escapism-style enjoyment,\n4. Play often includes periods of speaking in the voice of your character, trying to represent them as separate from yourself, etc.\n5.

Contraverting any of these already has a label, for example...\n\nIf you don\'t have enough chance in your game, it gets labeled a story game.

They\'d have to lose control of their character to do it, though.  Some board games pull this off, like Sheriff of Nottingham.  You could do it with a setting conceit where your characters are piloting robot suits, or a Westmarches game, or something like that.

rpg,t3_a38efh,"Realism vs CrunchI was reading the thread about recommending a realistic medieval game. A number of people recommended crunchy systems (GURPS, Chivalry and Sorcery, Mythras, Burning Wheel, etc), while some other people recommended simpler systems. I think the majority of upvoted comments were recommending crunchy systems. 

So I was wondering, why do you think it is (if you accept the premise of the question) that so many RPG players associate realism with crunch? It's pretty obvious that you could play a very realistic game with a rules-lite system, so when did crunch and realism become so strongly associated? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a38efh/realism_vs_crunch/,"['People don\'t mean realism when they say realism. They want simulation, and they get that through the rules. They really mean ""less abstraction"", and less crunchy games are heavier on abstraction.', 'I think it partially might be because the question is a loaded one. Pretty much EVERY game can be realistic (more-or-less, within the context of the setting) if the GM and players want to play it that way. That\'s always an option. \n\nHowever, when someone talks about a ""realistic"" game, there\'s an inherent implication that they mean ""a game for which realism is encoded into the rules."" Rules-lite system are generally not realistic in that sense because, by definition, they don\'t have that many rules to begin with. Realism is left to the player. Crunchy games, on the other hand, have the opportunity to enforce realism within their mechanics, instead of leaving it to the players. ', 'Because back in the 90s a bunch of people made ""very realistic"" systems that had a lot of crunch.\n\nMore honestly, life is crunchy.  Lewis and Clark took two years to prepare for their journey.  Two years.  It\'s the equivalent of the journey most D&amp;D parties take with about two minutes worth of ""planning"".  Logistics is hard, and laughably minor details like ""did you bring snowshoes"" would sink you.  Most adventurers would end up more or less like the Donner Party if realism was allowed to intrude.\n\nThe fact is the logistics of journeying into the unknown are so unbelievably difficult that the most crunchy system you can imagine covers a tenth of them.  In that circumstance, more realism  = more crunch.', 'For me, the really interesting question is what were you understanding as ""realism"" when starting initial thread? And if asking for ""historical medieval"" games actually gives any different result?', 'It\'s very easy for people to see, well if I want to hit this other person with something there\'s actually a lot of things - a lot of forces, a lot of factors on probability - that go into that.\n\nThere\'s my ability to hit accurately.\n\nThere\'s their ability to get our of the way.\n\nThere\'s environmental factors - footing, possibly wind, visibility.\n\nThere\'s the quality of the weapon.\n\nThe quality of the armor.\n\nSo on.\n\nSo it\'s pretty easy for me at least to see how people conceptualize all that and confuse simulationist - bringing all those factors in via dice - for ""realism"".', 'I disagree with your premise.\n\nIt is much harder to deliver a realistic result, without fiat, in a simple system. Take a simple sword strike for example. In a realistic medieval setting you have to deal with the effects of armour, bleeding, shock, scarring, what part of the body is hit, bone damage, treatment, not to mention a whole sub-system for infection. An attempt to realistically model these will create crunch.', 'I do not think Realism needs to be mirrored by crunch, for example, Cyberpunk 2020 is pretty crunchy and realistic (for the most part), getting shot in the head is a lethal experience and its pretty much automatic at point blank range with even an unskilled enemy. But a simple narrative game can model Realism just as easily and sometimes better depending on the GM. For example, a simple rules system doesn\'t get in the way with charts and modifiers and all that if its more narrative focused, you miss because the narrative would assume you miss in dark conditions and under stress...As a GM I like more realistic leaning games most of the time (games like Invisible Sun might be the exception), but you can mirror fast deadly combat in a lot of systems. Including things like PbtA, where taking any Harm at all can drastically reduce your life expectency if the game setting also reinforces that healing is not an easy magic handwaive or is a rare ability. \n\nThere are other simple systems that do danger and realism pretty decently too, Delta Green comes to mind. Its a little bit of crunch, but at its heart its just a percentile system, the average Agent HP to firearm or monster damage is pretty disheartening. One hit can incapacitate or kill a player even in the first round of combat (I know I\'ve seen a few check out that way). \n\nYou can also make a crunchy game that is supposed to be realistic - not at all -if you don\'t take into account the same things that some simpler narrative systems reinforce (The Environment, Benefits and Penalties, Modifiers, etc.) A game that is more narrative encourages the GM to always be thinking about the atmosphere of the scene, whether its raining, if its slick or dark out....These things can mirror realism if you make them matter, they retract from realism if they don\'t matter. \n\nExample: A character\'s automobile is broken down on the highway in the middle of nowhere, they don\'t have tools, this only matters if the PC can\'t just MacGuyver the car into functioning by taking simple penalty...You reinforce the narrative and the realism when these things have consequence and the system is either helping you or hurting you in doing that. For example, in D20 systems, a character without repair or tools can probably just take penalty X to their Intelligence check and fix the car anyway. In Cyberpunk 2020 if you are unskilled you\'d have a -3 penalty with a base Tech stat roll and another penalty for not having the appropriate tools, but probably can\'t beat the Base Difficulty due to the complexity of fixing an engine versus a simpler machine. This is the exact same situation as the D20 mechanics, but the system reinforces the realism. But this can be done even easier in a PtbA game or similar light system where the GM just makes a ""Hard Move"" or a FATE point spend or whatever else, the GM simply declares ""You can\'t fix the car, you don\'t have tools or the part you need, you have to walk the creepy highway at night, in the snow - to get to the next town or gas station..."" So the narrative created realism. ', ""This is something that has been on my mind too. I think the thing is that I can name many crunchy systems that are unrealistic and don't try to be. D&amp;D being the prime example here. I don't really know of any low rules systems that attempt realism. "", ""&gt; It's pretty obvious that you could play a very realistic game with a rules-lite system\n\nIs it? Maybe it's subjective - and people like all the little mechanical details as their assertions of how the game world works?

Does anyone have a clear definition?"", ""Crunch tends to mean more rules, which means things are usually covered in logical ways that aren't hand waved for simplicity.  \n\n\nI think the reason crunch and realism get lumped together is because of the fact that when you say you are going for a 'realistic' campaign then it means there will be ways for a player to do all those things that realistically a character would be able to do within those rules without GM fiat. There is nothing wrong with a GM deciding things, but when their are hard bound rules for things like parrying or wrestling an opponent the player feels more in control and knows what the standard is going to be. It levels the playing field and they know that those things are possible without having to have the GM adjudicate something special which they may or may not agree with. "", 'They sort of always have been, thanks to the hobby\'s wargaming roots.

Back then there were a lot of fantasy heartbreakers (and systems in other genres for that matter) that didn't seem to understand that D&amp;D was more interested in emulating pulp fantasy fiction than it was in being realistic. This led to complaints that various abstractions used in D&amp;D were 'unrealistic' and that the only way to be more realistic was to become more and more mathematically intricate to better simulate how things would 'really' work.   \n\n\nAside from often being poor games, the writers who chased this dream were often horribly misguided about what was 'realistic' and ended up creating rules that led to far \\*less\\* plausible outcomes than D&amp;D."", 'People often conflate “realism” with “difficult” or “complicated.” When realism is more of an aesthetic. Now I’ve never gotten the appeal of realism (I play games to escape the real world, why the hell would I want to simulated it), but one of the great virtues of the world is not everyone shares my point of view, and the idea has some weight to certain people, so ok.\n\nI think though the idea of a medieval rpg kind of insists on a more challenging system. If you’re going to be reflecting on the lives of people in medieval times, which were hard, short, and brutal. It’s best you have a system that reflects that. So I do feel in this instance a crunchy is appropriate, not because of realism, but because of the medieval element.\n\nAgain, when you’re selecting a game you’re trying to find a certain feel, and the feel of medieval life was not easy. So selecting a more crunchy system may be useful in this case, again not because of realism, but because of your setting and feel you’re going for.', '[deleted]', ""I have no idea why so many RPG players associate realism with crunch.  Having been told @steenan what 'Crunch' means I can see no direct connection or dependency between them.\n\nRealism in RPG's was discussed at length on the Critical Hit forum well over a decade ago.  \n\nIn terms of a historical simulation it means accuracy and authenticity which in turn has an impact upon the rules of the game, but does NOT necessarily require more of them to achieve, nor greater adherence to them.  Over and above that 'crunch' aspect 'Realism' has far more impact upon setting, background and the meta-physic's of the game environment than it does upon the rules.In a fantasy game context the term 'Realism' has a somewhat different meaning.  \n\nIn a game involving dragons, magic, space ships or psychic's the idea of accuracy and authenticity becomes pointless unless of course one is trying to accurately simulate the settting of a book or film e.g. Lord of the Rings, or Serenity.   The more usual interpretation of 'Realism' in the context of a fantasy game is 'consistency' and 'integrity of in game concepts'.  This has the same implications as 'Realism' in a historical game, without the constraints of history and real world physics.\n\nPlayers will often complain about a lack of 'realism' in a game as a shorhand for what they perceive as a lack of logic or randomness in events and/or actions.  Likewise GM's when promising realism in a fantasy game (as I did) usually mean that the game universe has been engineered to be consistent and predicable in the way it works.  \n\nThat does not necessarily mean that dragons, magic, space ships and psychic's will not play a part in that universe.  It merely means that their existence is consistent with the nature of the world, can be explained by its physic's and will be consistent in the way they appear in the game.  Therefore, players should be able to predict how, when and why such elements will be experienced by their characters, rather than simply have them dropped into the game by the GM seemingly at random.\n\nThat cannot be achieved simply by adding more rules, because to work it requires a universal understanding of how the world works whether historically or logically.\n\nIn the case of a Medieval RPG the GM would need a thorough knowledge of medieval history to be able to meet the challenge.  \n\nIn the case of a Fantasy RPG the GM would need to have a consistence and logical explanation for the existence of magic, and how it works, or dragons and where they come from.  Whether or not the game mechanic's were light or heavy."", ""If you compare a d4 system in a game that's about 16 year old kids trying to balance work and school in 2018 vs a d1000 system about anthropomorphic squids trying to save their dimension using symbiotes that bestow magic powers it's fair to say the d4 is more realistic and the d1000 isn't (unless I've been horribly mislead by reality.)   \n\nSo it's two things:   \n\n1.

rpg,t3_a37lkw,"Which Sci-Fi RPG System Would You Recommend?I've been doing some research lately on what sci-fi RPG system would best suit me and my gaming group's needs / wishes. We play D&amp;D 5e currently, which is the only system we know how to play and are familiar with.

The systems I'm interested in the most and which seem to get a lot of praise are:

* Stars Without Number
* Esper Genesis
* Coriolis
* Traveller
* Synthicide
* Scum &amp; Villainy

The kind of 'vibe' we would love to play is a mix of TV shows like The Expanse, Firefly, Star Trek / The Orville, Battlestar Galactica and Stargate Atlantis. I personally love the type of show where every episode they visit a new world which is vastly different than another, and are faced with problems / quests there. In addition, the type of 'harder' sci-fi like The Expanse or maybe even Battlestar Galactica I also find very appealing.

&amp;#x200B;

So far I know that Esper Genesis would be easy to learn, since it's basically 5e in space, but on the other hand it may also feel too much 'the same' as 5e to really create a different experience tailor-made for sci-fi, which is where Stars Without Number and Traveller really excel from what I can tell.

You\'d probably get more mileage out of the game systems than the setting.', ""My main problem with Esper Genesis is that it suffers from the same problem as Starfinder: it's just D&amp;D in space.  It's a great product, and it's fun to play.  So don't take my criticism as anything other than face value.  But it's just a cosmetic reskin of D&amp;D 5E.\n\nSWN, on the other hand, somehow manages to overcome that obstacle.  It uses the engine, but it *feels* like a different game.  It feels like the system was designed for guiding starships across the quadrants.  It somehow made a completely different game using the rules and concepts we already know.  I adore it.\n\nI need to read up on Traveller, as it's pretty popular on these boards.\n\nThere's also Mothership.  If nothing else, utilize the companion book as it has a random ship generator using a handful of d6's.  Also, the game itself is neat.\n\nSword and Wizardry has White Star, which is more Tongue-in-cheek and evokes more of a Hitchhiker's Guide or Ice Pirates feel."", ""Traveller, more specifically Traveller: The New Era because of rules polishing, is probably the best system when you want to run hard sci-fi games, **if** you are willing to work with vectors for space battles.  \nGround combat is a bit crunchy, in terms of preparation, but the resolution tends to be quick, and it's quite deadly.  \nTask resolution is extremely simple, with a d20 roll-under vs the skill, which gets multiplied by the difficulty factor (from x4 for easiest to x0.25 for hardest).  \n\nThe tables in the TNE core manual help you create virtually infinite worlds, with their ecosystem, population, government forms, and so on.  \n\nThe rules already cover people from different origins (high/low gravity, high/low population, and so on).  \n\nThe Cepheus Engine is basically an SRD of the **first** edition of Traveller, and it's available as PWYW, so you can check if you like it and then support the developers, though I still suggest TNE.  \n\nI haven't yet read SWN, but I've read some people saying it's very close to Traveller in concept and application.

So it should *kind of* fit your needs. \n\nI say kind of because of your appeal for ""planet of the week"" style, S&amp;V is built around being a crew of not-completely-legal space workers, ranging from mercenaries to psychic and rebels, doing jobs to get some cold cash. It also has a built-in faction game, where your acts have consequences, and you can\'t just run away from it. It\'s also mostly focused on a tight number of systems (with enough planet to go around I guess).

So far these seem the most interesting to me (in no particular order):\n\n* Stars Without Number\n* Esper Genesis\n* Coriolis\n* Traveller\n* Synthicide\n* Scum &amp; Villainy\n\nIt seems Stars Without Number and Traveller are a bit more oldschool style of play and harder sci-fi. Coriolis just looks amazing, but I have no clue how it would play. It seems to have just the right amount of crunchiness though. Scum &amp; Villainy seems light and fun, but maybe lacking options for people used to playing D&amp;D 5e. Synthicide is new and seems very interesting also with the ARC mechanic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts?', 'Eclipse Phase is fun if you want something grittier.

Should you also be looking to invest in and / or want to start a sci-fi campaign I hope this can be of use to you. Feel free to comment and discuss!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow of course I didn't get the chance to read all these books front to back yet, but still enough to get a reasonably good idea of what they're about and make a choice of what we'll be playing at our gaming table. (Which may change again later.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the winner(s) are... **SCUM &amp; VILLAINY** and **TRAVELLER!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SCUM &amp; VILLAINY**\n\nFor a group who has been playing D&amp;D 5e for 4 years in an epic, immersive campaign (that's still on-going), Scum &amp; Villainy offers a fun and light system to just play some sessions with. Mainly this will be a Firefly / Star Trek / Orville / Cowboy Bebop kind of vibe and meant not to last for years and years and be very 'deep'. This system seems perfectly suited for episodic one-shot adventures, also allowing some of my other group members to take a shot at DMing a session perhaps. I really dig how this is very different from D&amp;D, offering a more 'cooperative' storytelling mechanic where the DM and players are telling a story very much 'together'. Also I love how it doesn't focus on numbers and stats too much. The book looks great by the way, and the PDF does not do justice to seeing it in hardcopy form.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said. Once we've got a good taste of the above, I do think that Traveller will be the system to use for a bigger, more extensive sci-fi campaign, that looks to be exactly what I was looking for initially.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRAVELLER**\n\nThis just looks to be the classic and the standard for most other sci-fi systems to live up to. There is a certain 'retro' vibe present, but honestly the system is so light on setting that it actually allows the broadest scope of subgenres to be played with it. There's a ton of supplement material already available for it; a book all about customizing ships, a book with more gear / items to use and some settings. I love homebrewing my own stuff, but having at least a good basis already there to use is certainly a plus. It just seems so complete rule-wise, including even a part about trading. All stuff that even though you may not use it at first, it's there if you need it. Some of the art in the book  isn't really my kind of style, but it seems clear to me now that these sort of things are very much secondary to the mechanics of a game and how it flows. That being said, the book looks great otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**STARS WITHOUT NUMBER**\n\nA very close second with Traveller. And maybe once I've read the books completely this will be the system we'll use for our main campaign. What put me off is mostly mentions of how it's a bit like Traveller but 'more D&amp;D'. I don't see why I would want that, considering a 'change' from D&amp;D is very much welcome. The book for Traveller is more appealing  to browse through than Stars Without Number. The lack of class options for SWN put me off, along with the whole psychic / psionic powers thing. All this seems a lot like 'magic' to me, which don't seem at home to me in a sci-fi setting. Traveller just feels more 'real' to me. Not necessarily dry or hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ESPER GENESIS**\n\nI can be short on this one. It's too much like D&amp;D in every way. It's a great book though, and the setting looks very interesting. Probably I'll use it for inspiration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CORIOLIS**\n\nOh, how looks can be deceiving... Easily the best-looking book of all, with amazing art and presentation. However, the setting is way too forced within the system and its mechanics. I don't see how you can play various diverse types of settings / games with this, so what's on offer really has to be appealing to you in every way. From what I've read its mechanics aren't all that special either. And, an intensely religious culture in a future space-faring civilization? Well, maybe, on some 'worlds' this could be a thing, especially those farther away from scientific knowledge and technology. Just look at Battlestar Galactica. And even if not realistic, it can certainly be interesting. But the fact that this is so much a part of this entire system / setting just put me off. Coriolis's setting certainly is cool for one or two sessions inside a larger, more varied universe, but I doubt I'll ever play the game as is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ASHEN STARS**\n\nSeems very nice honestly, with a cool setting and a wonderful book to read. GUMSHOE isn't doing it for me though. There's like 10 lines of text on combat in the entire book, but there's about 50 ridiculously named skills that no one will remember from the top of their head ever? Yet space combat seems overly complicated. Spending / running out of points to discover stuff doesn't feel right to me either. It's a shame really. I may use the setting for inspiration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SYNTHICIDE**\n\nThis one could be interesting if there's ever a second edition, refining the lay-out of the book a bit more and adding artwork. At certain points it just looks too 'raw' to me. The font, the layout, the look of the tables, etc. It just sort of feels like a beta version. And it could certainly benefit from some artwork. 'Style' is such a weird thing. For instance, Scum &amp; Villainy doesn't have much art and looks very simple and plain. Yet, it feels 'right' somehow for that book. Anyway, the ARC system really seems great, and this would be a great setting for a more 'cyberpunk' themed game. Combat is nice, as well as resolve and cynicism. I really think this can evolve into a great game with future editions, which I'd buy and play for sure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;"", 'Maybe consider Savage Worlds? It is a pretty solid generic system, there is a sci-fi companion that treats sci-fi in general terms, and a bunch of sci-fi settings to draw from. Individual books are usually quite inexpensive.\n\n']"

rpg,t3_a311zo,"Advice Wanted: Blade Runner campaignIf you are in the 2054 campaign, turn back now!

&amp;#x200B;

\------

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, r/rpg! Here for some feedback about a world-building question. (If this isn't the right sub I'd be happy to post elsewhere).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently running a Blade Runner campaign (using Savage Worlds) and it's going really well! It's set 5 years after 2049 and while I've stuck mostly to rules established in the movies and shorts (with some concepts pulled from the original book), I've of course expanded and made some logical ""next-steps.""

&amp;#x200B;

One of these steps is the creation in my world of a ""Replicant Reprogramming Machine,"" in which a user can rewrite a Replicant's personality. (For background, in the ongoing BR universe, all new Replicant models are supposed to be subservient to humans - this machine offers a few ways to break this norm.)

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few modes of this: 1) Interrogation (make them completely truthful); 2) Transfer (make it so they only take orders from certain humans and not all); 3) MOSES (free the Replicant from taking orders from any humans); and 4) SLEEPER (creates a second personality which has no knowledge of the first, but the first knows the thoughts of the second, making them perfect for information-gathering).

&amp;#x200B;

We have also established that Replicants' DNA is functionally identical to humans. I extrapolated this from the fact that, if they weren't, K would have easily determined that the bones they retrieved are Replicant bones, and that he would have been able to figure out the two identical records were both of Replicants. Also in the opening crawl: ""Replicants are bio-engineered humans.""

&amp;#x200B;

So the deal is: humans and Replicants are functionally identical with respect to DNA; however, they are not psychologically the same, as Replicants are implanted with memories, and are emotionally more volatile and in many ways ""more human than human"" in the dystopian future of Blade Runner.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the rub: one of my PCs is a mad scientist type. The party has gotten their hands on this technology and used it on a few Replicants, but this PC wants to find out what happens when a human uses it, so they have the full range of knowledge before deciding whether to share this with anyone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my ask for the fine folks of r/rpg is: what the hell would happen if a human stepped into this thing? I kinda don't want it to be ""nothing,"" but I'm not sure about saying ""the same thing that happens to Replicants,"" although that would push a certain theme...

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts welcome. Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a311zo/advice_wanted_blade_runner_campaign/,"['So this whole thing can go any number of ways, depending on how you want the story to go and which avenues you want to explore.  \n\n\nThere are 3 main avenues this can go: It works on humans, it doesn\'t work on humans, or the machine has safeguards that prevent use on humans.  Whichever route you go, there can be complications.  \n\n\nIf the technology does work on humans, there\'s a question of degree. Do all of the operation modes work? Does only one of them work? How well do they work? What are the side effects? This could be the perfect time to do something like an evil wish genie exercise if they try to use it to mind control somebody.  Yes, they HAVE to do what you told them to do, but nothing is stopping them from actively working against you.  Either taking too long, turning themselves into the authorities, or otherwise not doing the thing in the exact way the PCs want.    \n\n\nIf the technology doesn\'t work on humans, and only causes side effects, what the side effects are depends mostly on how the tech works. Is it straight subliminal messaging, or clockwork orange style brainwashing?  Is it literally changing neurons in the brain? Is it done by pumping mind control chemicals into the bloodstream? Figure out a basic mechanism, and then think about how that can go wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf there are safeguard that prevent use on humans, what are they?  An easy one is to check the subject for the eye tattoo, but I\'m sure there are other markers it could use. In this case, it could be done to prevent either of the first two cases.  Once a machine is attempted for use on a human, it could also shut itself down with some sort of ""See a Wallace Corp technician to fix your machine."" message, or straight up alert authorities or something. This option also has the effect of not working on older-style replicants, since they don\'t have the newfangled eye marker.  This method is also a good tactic to stall for time as a GM to figure out what the effects you want are, while giving the PCs an obstacle to overcome (circumventing the safeguards).   \n\n\nAs far as mechanical effects from the machine, you could do all sorts of things, like add Hindrances to people that get put into it. New character flaws are bound to get noticed eventually. Going through the ordeal of the machine is bound to cause a few vigor and/or spirit checks to see how damaged you get.   \n\n\nOne idea I had while writing this is that NPCs that get put through this upgrade from mook to wildcard.  But instead of the wild die helping them as per normal, have it be the original personality trying to break through.  Any time the wild die succeeds and the main die fails, whatever the original personality would want in that situation is what happens.  In a fight, they clearly want to defend themselves, but when lying to a guard about why they\'re here after hours, the truth may come out.   Or have something disastrous happen on a double nat 1.  Possibilities are endless.', 'Firstly, I\'m curious what you\'re using to run the game in Savage Worlds, are you just using the core rules with the Sci Fi Companion/ World Builder Kit, or using an extra supplement like Nova Praxis? Mostly asking because I\'m running something kinda similar but more based in the Nova Praxis setting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, to your actual question, extrapolating off of the idea that Replicants are bio-engineered humans I would start with the assumption that one of the changes that has been made to them in the process would be susceptibility to such a machine. That is to say that their brains were engineered in such a way that they respond a specific way to certain subliminal signals or other form of triggering mechanism. Now here\'s where I\'ll need to ask you to stick with me for a bit because how this would work is based off of a series of assumptions I\'ve made about the way things work in the BR universe that may or may not hold true or that you may just outright disagree with. These assumptions are as follows:\n\n* Tyrell engineered the replicant brain to function identically to that of a human\'s (or as near as possible to identically)\n* Wallace does not have as good of an understanding of how to engineer replicants as Tyrell did and so he is forced to make minor adjustments to the previous models to achieve the changes he wants and cannot re-engineer the entire brain to make the replicants truly subservient\n* New replicants have had their brains tweaked such that they are now more susceptible to manipulations that are known to be effective on people\n\nSo if you stick with that train of thought this would mean that any machine that works as the one you explained on replicants would therefore have a noticeable effect on humans but not in as noticeable a way. As such I would treat the effects as follows:\n\n1. Interrogation - I envision this working like an ideal truth serum on replicants where the interrogator can simply ask whatever they want and the replicant will answer truthfully. For a human I would play this as having a more subtle effect more in line with being inebriated where your brain stops trying to filter what you\'re saying and so you\'re more likely to respond truthfully, but whereas a replicant will answer anything without second thought a human would need to be treated more carefully. They would retain some understanding of the situation they are in and be able to not respond at all if the questioning gets too intense or starts going in a direction that they really want to avoid.\n2. Transfer - How this would work on a person would be heavily dependent on how you see it working on replicants. One way that I can think of to handle it would be to have the willingness to take commands/orders based on an idea of loyalty and ""right"" that the replicant believes in (or is made to believe in) and the transfer operation manipulates those feelings to make the replicant loyal to a given person. With this method you are basically implanting a specific thought and ideal into the brain of the target, and while making a human entirely loyal through this implantation would probably not work it might be possible to use it to implant a specific idea which could be something like a single vague order. Whereas with the replicants you are implanting the idea of devotion to the new ""master"" with a human you could go a sort of Inception route and implant a single idea that will influence the following behavior of the person\n3. MOSES - functions under the same concept as the above but breaks the inclination towards the implanted thought/idea/belief from #2\n4. SLEEPER - Ok, so my mind immediately went a bit dark on this one, but hey it\'s Blade Runner dark is what we do in this dystopia. Staying with the idea that all of these are extrapolations on real world techniques, or pseudo-sciencey somewhat plausible techniques, this one is where we go bad, and by that I mean torture. I\'m thinking something like a more effective MK Ultra where, through auditory and visual stimuli and maybe application of advanced psychedelics the target is put through a series of horrific hallucinations done to force the target into a dissociative fugue at which point the machine swaps to nurturing a receptive second identify  that has been created as a coping mechanism in the realm of the effects of trauma causing dissociative identity disorder. As for how that effects a human, since their brains haven\'t been manipulated to cause them to cope in a specific way allowing for the targeted separation of personalities and proceeding grooming of the one that comes out of the state, break them as you see fit.\n\nHopefully this can give you some ideas to mess around with and play off of as you figure out the route you want to take!', ""My feeling is - it works, but imperfectly.\n\nA Replicant would hard hard-wired for accepting orders, whereas a Human would not, so rather than creating subservience this machine might make a Human more open to suggestion, but not entirely. I would suggest that the effect be temporary though, and cause lasting psychological damage (personality disorders).\n\nI suggest:\n\n1) Interrogation make them truthful, but Humans are able to resist to a degree and it wears off quickly.\n\n2) Transfer could allow for orders to be given, but I would suggest that only orders stated while the occupant in is the machine work.\n\n3) MOSES could maybe have no effect, or make the Human think that they are a Replicant.\n\n4) SLEEPER doesn't necessarily create another personality, but has the Inception effect, allowing something to be implanted into the mind, but the Human is aware that something is wrong."", ""Realistically: nothing, as they'd make damn sure that thing is ineffective on humans. They'd probably have some sort of special receptors in their brains for that.\n\nDramatically: Looks harmless, but extended use sorta works, but the human goes crazy after that.""]"

rpg,t3_a2z1rs,"I need superhero System, that is simple to DM and supports a wide range of abilities ( imagination ) for school RPG groupI am preparing material for GMing for school RPG groups.

And my two world repertoire will be Classic Fantasy D&amp;D style ( allready have this sorted out ), and another that I think kids will love - **Superheroes**. ( third would be Wizards-HP style, but i think once I find good system for Superheroes it should be usable for it )

Now i considered following systems but after lot of consideration found them unsuitable for reasons below :  


1. Numenera/Cypher - This is absolutely closest to what I am looking for. Easy to Narrative DM ( just set difficulty ) only 3 stats ( but logical ). Where this system fails is heavy resource management - that I think will be to much for kids to wrap their heads around. And absolutely bad character creation ( although they are sure its the best )  


2. PbTA ( Masks ) - Although simple, this system is not meant for kids. It lacks crunchines that makes the game, a game. Its too narrative. I see it more as vessel for adults to tell structured stories.  


So both of these wont work. I need something else...  


Now here are requirements

* **Easy to DM on the fly**. Enemies should be no more than **DC** \- perhaps with some cool descriptor
* Should be able to create any power you wish - With as least possible ""**no you cant do that**""
* Should be crunchy, but not much - **so not to many stats**
* Some kind of progression would be good, kids like to feel rewarded with progression
* **Dice rolls are fun** \- Combat should be fun, and it should be crunchy enough so kids dont feel that DM is cheating

Why does he want souls? Why innocent souls of all souls?\n\nIs he a quirky collector of souls? Then he will search rare souls, and won\'t settle for a peasant soul... he wants kings! Wizards! Scholars! Heroes!\n\nIs he a prison warden? Then he wants to catch the sinful.\n\nDoes he use souls to power himself? The more the merrier, of course more powerful souls can be even more useful...\n\n//////\n\n**The nature of my game**\n\nI have a couple of players who *love* making deals with my devils/demons. And I love being able to present them interesting dealers.\n\nYour devil should play by the rules. After all, he made a contract, and he is bounded to what the contract say as much as the characters.\nObviously he can make use of loopholes in order to receive more than what he gives.\n\n*Example: Gusaras from* Beasts and Barbarians: Tricarnia, Lands of Princes and Demons.\n*Gusaras are Demons of Gluttony and Truth. In exchange of something edible, a Gusara answers truthfully a single question. Each time he demands something more morbid (for example: apples, then hair, then nails, then brain, then an entire corpse, then a living human...), but it doesn\'t mean that the answer will be more precise.\n\nPlayer: ""Do you know where our enemy is?""\n\nGusara (chewing the cheese the party gave him): ""Yes, I know.""\n\nPlayer: ""...and?""\n\nGusara: ""I answered your question. If you want to ask me another question, bring me... a wolf.""\n\nPlayers imprecations*\n\nYour player have to outsmart the devil, whatever kind of devil he is, otherwise he will find and abuse a loophole.\n\n////////\n\n**What\'s puzzling you?**\n\n17 innocent souls from the first player. When is a soul innocent? Everyone does sinful acts, only infants have no sin...\n[17 is an unlucky number in Italian folklore, did you pick it on purpose?]\n\nHow is a soul stolen? Can it be a simple question of killing their vessel (aka the human body), even if it is a child? Is it necessary a specific artifact or ritual, eventually teached by the devil himself? Does the player have to challenge the human for their soul, or strike a deal with them? \nOr has the player to corrupt their target, pushing them to commit sinful acts until reached a pooint past every possible redemption?\n\nSecond player: Servitude for Swarms. Belzebub, meaning Lord of the Flies, is a title of the devil. Whichever task you want can be ordered to the second player. Each time the mission (I will mantain the unlucky numberology: 13) is harder and more cruel, until **Anastasia screamed in vain**: he has to kill someone he cares about: a relative, a friend, a lover. But at this point, he probably won\'t care anymore...\n\nThe third one has servitude (6 missions) and then be an intermediate dealer / collector. \nTo him (but also for the other two, if you want them to take a more ""diplomatic"" approach) the devil should give sheets of black paper and bloodlike ink. The mortal has to sign the contract with that ink and cannot be forced to do it, only persuaded with the right offers (what does he want? Power? Love? Money? Wisdom?). Or, a la Cuphead, the mortal has signed a contract in the past, and it\'s the time to beat the shit out of them to take their soul, even if the mortal is a friggin dragon!\n\n(Oh, better for your players to not lose the papers and the ink, or the devil will take their souls.)\n\n\n**Have some sympathy**\n\nAll if these are potential side quests, or an entire ""fetching"" campaign. If there is no time limit, you can sprinkle the requested souls in whatever location you desire.\n\nGently remind them that the devil awaits his payment, so **have some courtesy**\n\n(Edit: formatting because of devil shenanigans)', 'You are essentially creating a new cosmology, because the idea of ""stealing Souls"" for payment doesn\'t automatically go with the DnD concept of Devils. Devils are evil, but lawful, so stealing a souls must be infinitely less valuable than winning one in a contract or a challenge. Also, what mechanics have you considered thus-far?\n\n', 'What system are you using? Perhaps there is a subsystem already in the mechanics that could be repurposed?', ""Well the Devil will want to make sure they get their share, so they will want to make sure the PCs are equipped to do so. The devil could offer to sell (at a moderate price) the PCs a soul-stealing weapon, or teach them a spell that binds someone's soul upon death. \n\nI would make the devil's methods of soul stealing messy. Maybe 1/6 times the soul turns into a horrific monster and must be defeated, only to waste the soul? Or maybe there are terrible side effects, like for each soul taken someone from their home village dies, etc. But if the PCs change their minds and stop stealing souls and fulfilling the bargain, something even worse happens. Like they begin to permanently lose points of constitution, which accumulates and can only be brought back by completing the bargain."", ""I've been running a devil-centric game, and here's something you might consider:  \n\n\nSouls can never be stolen. If they could, Devils would have a much easier time of things.  \nSouls can only be given away. That's why devils make bargains. That's why the contract is a thing, why the devils are willing to give up things to get your soul.  \n\n\nWhy should the mortal player be any different? Now they have to make the deals, and make other people give up their souls.  \n\n\n**\\*The Internals Inkwell\\***  \nA small, ordinary looking pot of ink, a roll of vellum, and a long black quill. The only outward unusual appearance is the makers mark, which changes to a new name every time you look at it.  \n\n\nThe inkwell is always full of ink, and the roll of vellum will never run out.  \n\n\nWhen the ink and the vellum are used to write a contract, and the contract is willingly signed by all parties involved, the terms of the contract are magically binding for all parties, as if they were under a Geas. Any party may, in the contract, give up their soul, which does nothing until they die. When someone who has given up their soul dies, they may not be resurrected, and their spirit is reincarnated in Hell as a new devil, with a CR equivalent to their character level and a devil type chosen by the GM. This is how Devils are created."", ""You probably should have come up with the mechanics before offering it. Souls are hard to obtain. Combat doesn't net a soul. Murdering someone unable to resist does. Watch American Horror Story: Coven for some ideas as they deal with souls as currency for Papa Legba. \n\nAs for servitude, that entirely depends on what kind of devil it is. Since you said you threw lore out the window, I don't know what to tell you. A true D&amp;D devil would be easy to offer guidance for. Lawful evil devils are cunning and always need agents to fill a role in their schemes. \n\nIt could be something as simple as starting a seemingly innocent rumor that results in someone else that signed a contract with the devil getting incarcerated, thus preventing him from upholding his end of the bargain with the devil, in which case the devil gets his soul. That would be a real eye-opener for the party to see that the devil will actively try to prevent them from being able to follow through on their part of the bargain."", 'Pathfinder has a system for this.\n\nhttps://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-soul-gem/\n\nEdited broken link.', ""I don't think there is a standard answer to your question.  It's the sort of issue that depends on the underlying lore and meta-physical rules that govern the universe in which your particular game is set, and so the answer can vary depending on which universe it is, and how you as the GM have chosen to interpret it.\n\nMy own gaming is usually set in the Warhammer universe and based on my interpretation of how gods and souls work stealing a soul wouldn't really be practical or indeed sought by a divine being.  But that's because  in my universe the God's are basically entities living in the void who draw their power from mortal emotions rather than collecting souls.  \n\nThe closest I can umagine to the collecting souls concept would be more akin to mortal corruption where the PC in question is tasked with the mission to increase a specific emotional output of from a mortal community. e.g. 'Blood for the Blood God' would be a mission intended to increase feelings of fear, violence, control and power amongst members of a cult.   Now whether the cult does this by killing innocents would be a sort of twisted mission where the PC was persuaded that the sacrifice of innocents was the goal, whereas in fact, its the emotional output of the killers that is the real divine benefit."", ""For the soul stealing part:\n\nHow about having them fight it on the etheral plane?\n\nDevils usually take souls by trickery, because that's easier.\n\nSouls are at least CR8 creatures and each one is unique."", 'What could possibly have possessed your players to think this is a good idea?']"

rpg,t3_a2rkym,"Trophy - a rules light horror game based on Cthulhu DarkTrophy is a game of dark fantasy and psychological horror, and one of the most exciting things in Codex, the zine published by The Gauntlet. The game was written by Jesse Ross and features striking graphic design and art (also by Jesse).   


Let me tell you all about it...  


Trophy is inspired, in part, by Cthulhu Dark by Graham Walmsley, and uses a similarly light mechanical framework. In the game, a group of explorers pushes ever-deeper into a forest that doesn't want them there in order to claim a ""trophy"" from the center of it. Will they get out of the forest alive? Will they avoid having a complete psychological break, succumbing to the terrors of the woods? Will they avoid turning against each other in an effort to survive?   


Spoiler alert: they will not.  


The game has a lot of interesting things going on from a GM's perspective. It uses a version of Graham's old mystery creation method from Cthulhu Dark to help build a forest that comes in ""rings,"" with each ring representing new kinds of temptations and terrors.The early rings are about making the characters feel confident and providing temptations that encourage them to push deeper and deeper into the woods. But as they get deeper, the true horror of the place begins to reveal itself. This ""ring"" structure is also organized around a theme, and is called an Incursion. GMs are encouraged to create their own Incursions inspired by a theme or use a pre-made one. SPEAKING OF WHICH...  


Codex - Dark 2 also comes with a sample Incursion called The Tomb of 10,000 Dreams, which has the theme of ""Sleep."" Future issues of Codex will continue to support Trophy with new Incursions, new character classes, new treasures, and a Bestiary. Codex - Emerald, for example, will have an Oz-inspired Incursion and Bestiary.

If so, what tips do you all have to help me write a mystery that’s engaging, suspenseful and interesting?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a2r9r2/help_needed_writing_a_murder_mystery_campaign/,"['A few thoughts:\n\n* First, you need to know what actually happened, as many details as you think might be relevant. And then your investigators will ask a question you weren\'t prepared for, which is ok - just make sure your answer is consistent with the ""truth"" you\'ve already established.\n* Second, check out the Three Clue Rule on the Alexandrian (can\'t link since I\'m at work). He has some good ideas on making sure there are enough opportunities for the investigators to find clues so that they don\'t accidentally get locked out of a vital clue because they missed a particular skill check.\n* Third, allow the investigators to freely investigate and follow the clues on their own. Rather than preparing a linear sequence of events, prepare ""nodes"" for specific locations and events, so whenever the investigators get to that node, you\'ll know what to do. Almost like rooms in a dungeon, except there\'s no set path for how to get to a particular node. Each critical node is usually ""unlocked"" by clues, in that the investigators won\'t have any idea to look into something in particular until they have a clue pointing them there. Of course, sometimes you get fun leaps of logic at the table where somebody goes to investigate a node on a hunch without the right clue. Just roll with it. Again, the Alexandrian has some good articles on Node Based Play that are useful reading.\n* Fourth, for this kind of investigation, timekeeping is critical. Don\'t allow thing to remain static, or the investigators will have time to just retry every roll until they succeed. Make them feel like they\'re under a time crunch. Set out a timeline of events for what will happen without the investigators\' intervention. After X days, the serial killer strikes again. The investigators have to deal with the fallout of another death, but they also have the opportunity to gain the new clues contained in this Node. I did a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/callofcthulhu/comments/7iafbh/timekeeping_during_investigations/) on the Call of Cthulhu subreddit a while back that outlined a method of timekeeping that you might find useful. ', ""If you can get access to them, GURPS Mysteries and Gumshoe books have good tips. Some things to keep in mind are not to lock away clues behind checks that can fail and don't have confused NPCs. If a clue is needed to solve the mystery, don't give your players a chance to fail to find it. And players highly value NPC testimony, so having an NPC be confused about what happened throws them off. They should either be telling the truth or lying so the players can catch them in the lie providing another clue. "", ""GURPS Mysteries is the single best book ever written on the problems and solutions that are unique to mysteries in RPGs. Absolute essential if you're just starting out.\n\nThe GUMSHOE game engine was designed for investigative games from the ground up and powers a number of games in different genres. None of them are just plain-old-crime, but you can probably find one that would serve you - I think for this scenario (serial killer) *Fear Itself* is the go-to game.\n\nhttps://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197312/Fear-Itself-2nd-Edition"", ""All the suspects have:\n\n* A relationship to the victim(s)\n* A reason to be the culprit (motive)\n* A reason to NOT be the culprit (alibi)\n\nThis allows you to improvise an investigation as opposed to constructing an elaborate puzzle that only has one solution. \n\nEnable players to automatically find core clues that move the story along and anything extra they uncover provides some kind of narrative or mechanical bonus. You don't have to create extra clues ahead of time when you ask the player HOW they gather extra clues and WHAT they find when they succeed. Let them do that heavy lifting.\n\nAny fumbles by the players result in the culprit being tipped off to prepare an escape or a trap for the investigators.\n\n"", '[The Alexandrian](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/7949/roleplaying-games/node-based-scenario-design-part-1-the-plotted-approach) has a perfect method for plotting out mysteries. Start here. It will help you prepare a design that is player-driven - they can do things in any order and follow the investigation and their intuition where it leads.\n\nI break up information into major and minor clues. Minor clues are just flavor. Players might miss them. Major clues are vital information (the killer is female; the killer is 5\'11""; the killer has a facial scar). \n\n', ""You might get some ideas from *Ghost Adventures* type shows because they always seem to involve murders in big old hotels. I expect you'll also find some horrible stories on You Tube as well. The TV Show 'Supernatural' is worth a look for the way they handle atmosphere, lighting and sets. 'Supernatural' also tends to use research into old dead news stories and recurring crime patterns through the decades. \n\nI know you're going for something different to the classic whodunnit, but there seem to be a lot of Agatha Christie's being repeated on TV at the moment, both Poirot (David Suchet) and Miss Marple (2 different ones). The Miss Marple ones have been absolutely star-studded and great fun to watch. It put me in the mood to run one. OF course in the Agatha Christie set-up every single NPC and PC has a secret or reason to be acting shady, or something about their life that *could* tie in. I'd expect the players to suspect the least likely people amongst the rest, as you do when watching TV shows. They are so intricate in details and timings that I think you'd need to just focus on preparing every single aspect of the crime and it's perpetrators' motives and methods. I'd have pen &amp; paper at my side through the session to note down everything the players did or said &amp; when &amp; where. I'd be hoping that they would misdirect each other a lot by accident. This could be the ideal game for note passing and out of room chats! A building plan could be very useful and details of the surrounding area. Even a Cluedo board could be fun. \n\n\n "", 'Frankly, my suggestion would be find another murder mystery adventure and file off the serial numbers. One of my favorites being ""Chimes at Midnight"" from the old Dungeon magazine, for example.']"

And of course tell me which edition has advanced rules.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a2qq2b/so_me_and_my_friends_decided_to_run_conan_rpg/,"['There\'s more than 3 official versions of Conan games released, and many more that are unofficial. I asked a similar question a while ago and I got some really good answers. Here\'s the thread, in case you wanna check it out: https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/930wlb/there_are_several_rpgs_based_on_world_of_conan/\n\nAfter researching the subject, I\'d personally recommend one of the unofficial or ""Conan-inspired"" versions, rather than officially licensed Conan games. That said, I have not looked at latest Modiphius release, so I can\'t  say much about it. \n\nIf you want something close to classic D&amp;D/AD&amp;D, try one of the D&amp;D clones like ""**Astonishing Swordsmen and Sorcerers of Hyperborea**,"" ""**Low Fantasy Gaming**,"" or ""**Crypts and Things**."" These are not Conan-specific, but heavily inspired by Sword &amp; Sorcery - and very easily adaptable to the world of Hyboria.  They\'re great IMO.\n\nThe **Modiphius Conan** is also a d20 system (D&amp;D 3.5), which is familiar, and has a TON of material released -- so it would make for an excellent resource, if you have to time to read all of it. Personally I\'m not a fan, but objectively speaking it seems like a good game. \n\nAnother honorable mention is ""**Blade of the Iron Throne**"" and its spiritual predecessor, ""**The Riddle of Steel**."" They\'re not official Conan games, but they\'re unabashedly inspired by it. Haven\'t played them but have heard a lot of good things about them. \n\n', 'The Modiphius system in print now is really good. Be advised though - the magic system takes some running thru before it “clicks”. I still struggle with it in some regards. However, the RPG captures the feel and gritty setting of the Hyborian Age.\n\nIf you are up to watching the series, this guy does a great job explaining the system as he runs his friends through a few scenarios:  https://youtu.be/wpIhA3NQwFs\n\nI do not have all the books, but I do have the Core Rulebook, Mercenary, Thief, Pirate and Book of Skelos. All you need is Core Rulebook, but the Book of Skelos helps with magic system a lot. Others are good but not necessary. Some of the rules are vague and they could have done a better job with editing. But once you get the feel of the mechanics it really is a sweet system for Conan’s world. Doom and Momentum pools are easy to manage. It’s easy to whip up an adventure in no time.\n\nEdit: Be sure to check Google+ and Modiphius forums; they are a good source for rules explanations and such. Shoot me a message if you like, would be glad to answer and help if I can.', ""Modiphius 2D20 (Age Undreamed Of) is a great system for Conan. The Momentum/Doom mechanic creates a nice meta currency cycle and it does feel like the Conan stories. It's got a lot of options, a lot of player skill, and I think the combat hits that sweet spot of crunchy (lots of rules) and cinematic.  \n\nIt's also the current edition, and a lot cheaper than finding some of the old stuff.

A Novice Wild Card in Savage Worlds is fairly competent, but won\'t charge 10 zombies alone, because even with a Sweep attack killing 3-4 of them, they remaining will gang up on him (+1 to Fighting for every ally in melee with the defender) and probably wound him.  \n\nObviously the Gang Up bonus is intentional, and you can remove it, should you prefer the heroic stand against the crawling monsters.  \nThe Witcher RPG use a stamina system to let the character avoid multiple attacks, meaning that without spending stamina they are hit and may take serious damage.\n\n\nDifferent games have different ideas about dealing with multiple opponents.\n\nMoreover, different players will behave differently.\n\nMaybe there is someone that really enjoys slaughtering thirty zombies with every swing, while emerging from the battlefield unscratched.\n\nHowever, sometimes there is a player (or character) that, upon seeing the enemy army approaching, will think ""The three of us alone won\'t be sufficient against the foes. Let\'s try a different strategy than rushing head on"".  \n\nThis kind of player will be frustrated if the ""correct"" strategy is ram the zombie enemy and strike them down like a wrecking ball against bowling pins: after all, this is the same strategy that the zombie are using. \n\nLast but not least: if the characters don\'t even sweat when defeating an army of basic enemy... is it necessary to play that part? You can simply narrate how the party completely destroy the ""zombies"".  \n\nSome players may like ""you hit and kill it, they fail the hit, you hit and kill another, they fail the hit, you hit and kill two of them, they hit you but only do minimal damage"" being repeated for 5, 10 or 20 minutes.  \n\nOther players might not even stand 1 minute of ""you hit they don\'t, easy fight for you, mighty hero! Your turn, do you keep hitting them until all of this 100 punching bags are down?"" He has no possible choice except: ""I attack"".\n\nThe solution, I think, is to make each fight relevant.  \n\n Are these 50 zombies trash enemies? The group decides to slaughtet them? Ok, easy: roll once or twice to determine if they have bruises (small damage) and how many of them each character takes down. A couple of minutes, and move on the game: where is the real deal, the lich, the BBEG?  \n\nAre these 50 zombies serious obstacles? The group decides to slaughter them? Ok: start fighting, it won\'t be easy, it will be challenging, and you will have to do hard choices, creating an emerging narrative (should I heal my fallen friend, or try to take down the zombies targetting out tank? Should we flee, or can we win this fight?).\n\n(Edit: formatting)', 'I thought you meant like an otyugh.', ""It all depends on system.  If you are plaything in a system with a steep power curve and strong difficulty effects - especially if combat is time consuming, one really does need to budget the number and type of combats.

Weak creatures hide and flee from strength, smart ones offer aid (or pretend to - leading PCs into traps) or otherwise cut deals.Morale and the GM exist for a reason - fights should be neither automatic or end only in Anhillation of one side.\n\nIn many systems with low power curves a fight with weaker enemies is still dangerous, and part of exploration is avoiding pointless resource depleting combat."", 'As an addition.

rpg,t3_a2oj54,"Letting a player GM a few sessions -- advice? Best practices?Hi everyone, one of my players have approached me about potentially GMing a few sessions.  I'm amenable to the idea, and I wanted to see if there is any general advice / best practices for something like this.

Some background:  I'm running an episodic cyberpunk game, designed to allow for ""drop-in"" play (i.e. anyone can show up and roll a character, and the party varies from week to week).  The setting is a homebrewed hard-ish scifi future of our city, and heavily based on real world extrapolations.  A lot of the setting is already available in a wiki, and both the player and I are of a similar wavelength when it comes to tone and content.  We have both been enjoying the game, but he's itching to change things up for a bit, hence the proposal.  I'll be swapping hats to be a player for those sessions.  Obviously, I'll try to avoid using GM knowledge to my advantage (though given that the game is heavily mission based and episodic, it should be pretty easy); I think I'll use the opportunity to highlight some cyberpunk archetypes that haven't seen play yet.

How do I prepare for ""handing over the reigns""?  What are some things that we should look out for?

Edit: If it wasn't clear, we're looking to do this with the existing setting, locales, factions, etc, (though probably putting existing plot hooks on pause).  We want other players to be able to just pick up the game with their existing characters without too much of an interrupted continuity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a2oj54/letting_a_player_gm_a_few_sessions_advice_best/,"['Give him a box of space inside the city (whether geographic, social, etc) to mess with as he pleases.

rpg,t3_a2lv7y,"Just Played Our First Session Of ""Dead Trench""""The discovery of a primal element called ether during The Great War alters the course of history. The gas form of ether causes distortions in reality, and allows beings from other dimensions to invade. Harnessing ether as a power source leads to the rapid advent of steampunk technology such as weapons and power armor, as well as the discovery of bioengineering, leading to the revival of the dinosaurs as bioweapons. The arms race prolongs the war, and involves countries originally not affiliated. Meanwhile, a miles-wide labyrinth of trenches appears inexplicably, and is rumored to contain fearsome monsters and priceless artifacts. Choose a side and rewrite history in Dead Trench.""

So goes ""Dead Trench"" a spinoff of my tabletop rpg series, ""Path of Destiny"". We played a map of a trench labyrinth on Roll20. One of my friends was GMing (we designed the game together), and I was a player, along with three other friends.

There are six classes in Dead Trench:
The Infantryman gets bonuses to gunplay and can use specialized arms, the Medic can heal and use poisons, the Engineer can build fortifications and set traps, the Caster uses magic spells, the Cultivator uses ki-based martial arts, and the Pilot can use steampunk power armor and tank heavy fire.

I was a Cultivator, my friends were two Medics and an Engineer. To summarize, we were shot by enemy soldiers, got lost in an ether cloud, and were attacked by a fire salamander and a minotaur in succession. On the last encounter, I got my leg stuck in a wall attempting to kick off it. Needless to say, this ended poorly.

In short though, we had a lot of laughs, and enjoyed some genuine tension. Hopefully it becomes a regular thing.

rpg,t3_a2l3at,"System Suggestions for Side GameI'm sure we've all read stories about GMs who run two simultaneous games where one party reacts to the actions of another-- for instance, a party seeks to rid the world of an undead curse and finally make it to the lair of the necromancer who has been pulling the strings the entire time when it is revealed that the necromancer was actually another player in a separate one-on-one game who had been trying to keep the party from destroying his empire the entire time.

I have a few situations in my current 5e game where I think it would be dramatically appropriate to give players the option to have their character break away from the party to go pursue their own goal or avenge some wrong. I think it could be interesting to have separate one-on-one sessions where we follow these characters and roll some dice to find out what happens, especially if there are consequences that can reverberate back to the main party. 

Any advice for doing something like this? I would be particularly interested in rules-light systems that would be able to abstract away many of the details-- I'm imagining a PBTA game where moves are based on factions taking action rather than individuals or something like that. Maybe even something like Microscope could potentially work (I have never actually played it), but I think I want there to be dice rolling and randomization.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a2l3at/system_suggestions_for_side_game/,"[""In a game I ran the players unexpectedly teleported the big bad to another dimension so between sessions of the main game I had us play [The Sundered Land](http://nightskygames.com/welcome/game/TheSunderedLand) over text on a discord channel.

It requires no dice but it was very fun for them to present a bunch of trials that the villain had to go through. \n\nI'm going to suggest using this for when players want to do a little mission on their own. It means that they get to have a short solo adventure but everyone still gets to participate and be up to date on what's happening to that character.\n\nthe game can also be played one-on-one if your players are into obscuring information."", ""It sounds like you should check out the faction turns in Stars Without Number. They're pretty abstract and about planet control and moving resources around, but it's basically a minigame for the GM to keep factions pursuing their goals in the background. In the second season of Friends at the Table, the GM used that system as a parallel game with some other players controlling certain factions, while the main players were running missions in The Crawl.\n\nAlternatively, Legacy is a PbtA game where each player controls a faction and a character in that faction (and side-characters in other factions), and there are separate playbooks and moves for the faction and character level. You may be able to use the faction rules from Legacy on top of another system for characters."", ""I ran a campaign for two years where the main party of PC's were interacting with a mix of NPC's some of which were played by other players (I called them Non-Permanent Characters or NPC's).  I actually wrote an article on the issues and benefits of this approach for 'Liber Fanatica' a fanzine which was popular at the time.  But to summarize:\n\nBenefits: \n\nProbably the greatest benefit is the change of attitude that PC players have towards the NPC's they meet.  Instead of being nothing more than expendable GM minions that can be treated as trivial and expendable pre-scripted characters.  I found the players who were never told which NPC's were player controlled and which were not, treated all the NPC's they met with much more respect, simple because they were not longer sure how they might react.  \n\n\nIssues:  \nThis then raises another issue which is how do player controlled NPC's react, and how do they differ from GM controlled NPC's.  The most obvious difference is that the player controlled NPC's are not constrained by the will of the GM.  They are free to achieve their goals by whatever means their player deems appropriate, and so nobody, not even the GM can be entirely sure what they might do.  So. whilst as the GM I set every NPC player a finite goal that their character was expected to achieve I had no control over how they they approached their task.  This made NPC behaviour far less predictable, and much more challenging both for the PC's and the GM.  \n\n\nAnother issue I discovered was maintaining continuity, both in terms of the passage of time (in game v real time) and in the integration of events in game.  The same issue can arise with split parties in general, but becomes more complicated as the number of seperate factions increases.  The basic example I quoted was that of a split party where one group is making a journey to another village several miles away, and the other group are sitting around a table in a tavern having a chat.  The irony being that travel over long distances whilst needing several hours of in-game time to complete actually doesn't take that long in real gaming time.   Whereas complex PC/NPC interactions in a tavern whilst perhaps only respresenting a half an hour of drinking anf talking in game, can actually take a long time to play through in real time.  So, you end up with players twiddling their thumbs for long periods with no active play to participate in.  \n\n\nRogue NPC's: Inevitably if you hand over control of an NPC to a player you run the risk that the player is going to just go rogue on your game.  But the real challenge is trying to decide whether this is a good thing or a bad thing.  Sometimes the NPC will come up with a novel strategy for fulfilling it role in the game that you never even thought of and in doing so transform the entire situation into something much more than you ever intended.  It therefore becomes a matter of judgement as to how much rope one allows a player controlled NPC before you step in and call the player to heel.\n\nI can honestly say that in the two years I used this approach none of the NPC players I recruited ever went completely off plot.  But a number of them step well outside the limitations of my expectations for their characters.  \n\n\nOne for example who was charged with stealing from the PC's actually managed to befriend them and win their trust, staing quite reasonably that its far easier to steal from someone if they trust you than trying to pick their pockets.  \n\n\nAnother Bounty Hunter charged with tracking the party decided it was far more effective to hire local street urchins to follow them around the city than to try and track them himself, and he ended up managing a whole network of under-age spies whilst spending a lot of his time at home with his wife and kids.  \n\n\nSo, yes havng another player play the evil arch-villan is a great idea, but just don't expect that player to stick to the script, and play to lose.  They are going to be as keen to survive and win as the PC's and you have no way of predicting how they might decide to do it.  ""]"

rpg,t3_a2klt7,"Conjure Tutelary Spirit D&amp;D Next SpellI am seeking feedback.

## Conjure Tutelary Spirit

7th level conjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action or please see text

**Range:** Special, please see text

**Components:** V S M (F) special

**Duration:** Permanent; special

The caster works on behalf of an institution, such as a city, a religious order, a family, etcetera, to reach an agreement between that institution and an outsider.\[1\] The deals involving a city or a religious order often involve angels of some kind; while families work with ancestor spirits (i.e lares) or eidolon. Please refer to lares and eidolon in Chapter Eleven.

The nature of *conjure tutelary spirit* as a spell permits negotiation between the mortals and the entity, permitting both parties to act voluntarily. A failure to reach a deal is not significant. The deals require the outsider to agree to defend the mortals if they are attacked (but not necessarily in a conflict the mortals start), and to offer advice and guidance when called to do so. This, in turn, requires the mortals to offer the outsider or spirit something it wants; a city and its leadership must maintain an alignment that matches that of a tutelary angel, while a family must honor the spirit of an ancestor and maintain their grave. A failure to do so on the mortal’s part violates the agreement. This means the outsider, or spirit, is not required to provide protection or advice.

There are benefits to a successful deal. When called upon for advice, the tutelary spirit responds to a question within a day, appears long enough for a polite and professional conversation, and departs. If called upon for protection, they appear in 1d6 rounds, remain in combat as long as necessary (until they are destroyed, or until the enemy stops being a threat) and then long enough to discuss the situation with any survivors of those they are to protect.

Such protection and advice is geographically limited; a lare only offers protection to its family on the family’s own property, while a planetar angel bound to protect a city is not obligated to protect its citizens outside the city boundary, and it is not possible to call upon them to offer advice beyond their territory.

The creatures contacted by the spell must possess a recognizable intelligence for the negotiations to work. Aside from that, there are few limits on what may be contacted. *Conjure tutelary spirit* does not force any outsider, or spirit, to act outside of its alignment. A chaotic being will likely quickly violate the deal, a lawful evil being will attempt to use loopholes to eat everyone, and lawful good ones will not support evil actions. Casters traditionally perform the spell on a Day of the Dead. Please refer to Chapter Seven for information. Attempting to perform the spell at another time increase its level to 8th.

\[1\] Some liches have successfully set themselves up in the role of a tutelary spirits. Successfully for themselves at any rate, as this does not work out so well for their hosts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a2klt7/conjure_tutelary_spirit_dd_next_spell/,
rpg,t3_a2kgi7,"Easier to RP as DM than a playerI've been addicted to D&amp;D since I binged the Adventure Zone this summer. I've been playing in several games but so far have found it uncomfortable to RP much.

So, I wonder if anyone has experienced this and/or have any tips to be a less shitty player?

But let's just keep that a secret between us...\n\nAnyway you might be finding playing NPCs easy because they are just shallow props compared to what player characters are.  You only need to play them for a short while, and so you never really have to get too deep with their character.  Most NPCs don't really need to develop or have arcs either - they just are what they need to be.  And if you don't like a particular NPC...it never appears again.  Meanwhile as a player you're stuck with this one character that you have to explore and develop along with however many other PCs are playing.  A lot harder in my opinion than playing bit parts.\n\nAs for helping you play a player character better.  I would say that you want to continually develop your character.  I wouldn't spend too much time (if any at all) on a backstory and stuff like that.  Too much upfront development can often lead to a static character.  Instead each session, decide what your character has learned and what new trait you will add to an ever growing list of behavior and personality quirks.  Also if you think you keep building the same character over and over again (some mix of your own personality) then challenge yourself to roll some random personality traits and try your best to follow them so that you really are playing a different character."", 'Well, the difference between an NPC and a PC, is that PCs are generally created with overall goals, and an NPC is created with a very specific goal. It’s easier to RP when you have a plain goal.\n\nLet’s say the PCs are coming into town and you have an NPC who is supposed to tell them about the Orc raiders. Well the PCs don’t know if the threat, the scope, or that they’re supposed to talk to this guy. But once they encounter this guy you know his entire purpose is to reveal the Orc Raiders, so when playing the character you know exactly the goal of that NPC.

I've decided to reduce the price for my DMs Guild 5e adventure by 70%, partly because of the holidays, partly because I've recovered the cost for putting the product together. Cheers!

***The Priest, the Witch, and the Lost Temple*** is a 40-page adventure for characters of levels 2 to 3. The town of Whitehaven is beset with undead. The townsfolk are quick to blame the so-called Witch of Whitehaven, who lives nearby with her partner in the Surbrin Hills. Yet a more insidious evil lurks in the midst of town, cloaked in a holy man’s robes. And far underground, an ancient evil artifact stirs. The town is in need of heroes. Will you answer the call?

In this adventure, you will find:

* a description of the town of Whitehaven
* a vivid cast of characters in the town and beyond
* a variety of locations that could be used or adapted elsewhere, including a town, crypts, a wizard’s home, and an underground temple
* a combination of roleplay, exploration, and combat encounters
* an adventure likely to entail 12-15 hours of gameplay.

In other words, this NPC has +X bonus at doing something they would be good at doing, and typically I\'ll just give them 1 hp for a noncombat npc or 1 HD if they are a combat suited npc like a guard.

With nowhere to go, they became homeless, living in burned out buildings, alleyways and streets. They've slowly begun to create a loose network, and a leader has emerged who wants to force the Crown to provide them with housing.\n3.

They have connections to the homeless, but the leader, most of all, wants to disgrace and humiliate the King and nobility for their lack of care for those affected by the war. He plans to steal the crown.\n4.

Will the players be allowed to slaughter random townsfolk for fun?

Exactly how much you need depends on the system, but it's easy to go beyond what you need and wind up stressing yourself out or making the game less fun. A good game has a lot of improv; get comfortable with it. In general, if you have fun NPCs and a basic understanding of the rules, the players will enjoy themselves. You don't \\*have\\* to do voices, but I find they can add a lot to the experience, even if they're subtle.

Let them know whether character deaths could happen and how the danger levels are pitched and whether the dangers will be glaring (AD&amp;D) or if they need to be quite paranoid (Spy/thriller game). *Make sure that everyone has their own special talent within the party that others aren't as good at. You want everyone to have their moment in the limelight. Be aware of specialism overlaps, Swiss army knife characters and stat optimisers. It can be do-able to have two people of the same character class in a party, or even to have a themed party of all the same type, but when everyone has the same skills it can be the loudest voices hogging the action. * Do remove any character classes from the list that won't be at all relevant in your game and do invent any less usual one that your plot could really do with. For example, you might have a Cyberpunk game where net-running isn't going to be too important, but you'd like a pilot added. * There's a lot to be said for restricting the group to the main usual types of character class and not allowing rarities and class type hybrids. It can protect you as a GM from all kinds of predicted and unforseen power-gamey  or special little flower reasons. You want your c/cs to be plot relevant, a good party fit, and not something that will de-rail your game. \n* Consider choices of merits, flaws and quirks carefully before allowing them. The GM needs to be fair if their pick is at the heart of their character concept. We know *Ironside* has a wheelchair and Indiana Jones hats snakes. The GM may have to stand firm in vetoing some options and dictating how the option is going to work in play. For instance, I say that 'danger sense' is something awarded by the GM sometimes and isn't constantly switched on. 'Fearless' doesn't suit a horror game. * I'd let the player have their own way about things that really don't matter to a GM, such as whether their dog is called Spot, or whether the character likes to listen to Mantovani or wear pink. These things could be important to the player who is basing their character on something specific. If you change all that they may abandon the character and role up fresh feeing aggrieved. I've seen this happen quite a lot and often the GM just doesn't 'get' the concept and has one of their own. * Always assert your GM right to veto anything you're not happy with at role-ing up, but also at later stages, should anything unexpected crop up. You won't realise that there's a broken mechanic until you stumble upon it. It's OK to change anything that's just dumb. I've never regretted standing my ground as a GM on something but I have regretted some times when I didn't * Start the players off with low level stats, especially when you want the characters to feel completely out of their depth against very powerful enemies. Don't be tempted to improve their stats too much too quickly. You don't want to be in a situation where the players can deal with every problem far too quickly and easily. You also want higher powers to be able to keep problem players in check. So if a new player's character starts behaving in ways that they shouldn't, some powerful NPCs can deal with that. There should be logical consequences to player actions and that 'cause &amp; effect' helps you to wing things throughout. \n\n\n\n"", 'Adventure prep: I\'ll pitch the game choice to the group and see if they\'re happy to go ahead and get them to role up characters. I like games like White-wolf World of Darkness that are very character-driven, usually with a modern day setting. If it\'s something  someone hasn\'t played before I\'ll talk them through the character of that game. I\'ll have a general loose overview of my whole game/campaign forming through brain storming, but the finer details won\'t be in place. The players will be able to do whatever they like and that could take things off in all sorts of directions. I\'ll approach the GMing according to genre and game system. I\'ll be thinking about whether I\'m happy with my various ideas or whether there\'s something that doesn\'t feel quite right somehow. I like to prep well before a session and usually find that we don\'t get as far as I expected we would, which always puts me ahead for the week after. So I might begin that process with the a general idea and I ask myself lots of questions, trying to anticipate everything the players will want to know and all the many things that their characters could do. Why would these characters engage? What will hook them in? In that process big or small things come to light that don\'t make sense. I\'ll ditch scenes and NPC\'s to come up with something that\'s better. I\'ll think about what my backdrops look like, ready to describe them, mentioning details that help to visualise and make it feel like a specific place. It helps me to get into it myself if I have a clear picture too &amp; I hope to create an atmosphere. Sometimes if you get caught out not having thought about something or the players go off in some very unexpected direction you can take a coffee break, tell them you\'ll get back to them on a question or even offer it to the floor. They may be pleased to be asked for their expert knowledge, such as exactly what firearm some guards would be using. I don\'t care, but they\'ll enjoy it.   \n\nI don\'t stat out really minor characters but I will take some notes for named NPC\'s. They might not involve numbers but can be turned into some stats easily enough. If they\'re a type I can extrapolate likely skills and personality traits when winging it: e.g. \'fireman\' or \'Stage School owner"". I\'d be tempted to flesh out some that just sounded interesting. Sometimes a passing stranger will become more important because a player is interested in them, or they won\'t engage with one you thought could be good. Some character templates that came with the game books could be useful to bookmark for likely combat scenes. GM screens often have handy lists and stats on them.

Especially smaller details, read it but dont worry about it.\n\nIf you do your own adventure, keep it simple. Dont try to be clever or original, have a npc or village that needs help for some reason. There is a bad guy / werewolf / bandit group in that dungeon / castle / tomb / forest, go help out. Also if you really  need to add a twist, do it at the beginning where it makes the adventure interesting, dont plan for a surprise reveal in the end because that never goes as imagined.\n\nKeep your story notes (for the session) simple, half a page of bullet points. If it doesnt fit, simplify your adventure.\n\nHave one or two backup encounters planned that work in most areas. Bandits or orc raiders work well. Use it for when your players go too far off the expected road and you need to have something for them to. Bonus: you now have about 30 or 40 minutes to think how to handle the change of plans.\n\nHave a list of random names, say 5 male and 5 female. Maybe also 10 random occupations. \n\nAlso, things to NOT do:\n\nPuzzles and riddles.. players either known the answer beforehand or the players spend an hour sitting on their hands in frustration. There is no benefit really.\n\nIf its essential that players know something, dont hide it behind a perception or knowledge roll. \n\n"", 'If you can pick it up, Sly Flourish\'s ""Lazy DM\'s Guide"" is gold for what to prepare and what not to.  There\'s even an audiobook version of it.  ', ""I wish that I knew about railroading. Do not force the players to do anything. Only ever say no in the character creation session (That being said, do a session 0) and always say 'yes' or let them do what they want. If what they want is stupid, let them do it and learn the consequences.\n\nAs for NPCs, give them a personality (it can be minor like baker, blacksmith, or whatever) and give the NPCs a desire. A blacksmith who wants to be a wizard for example can allow for a lot of fun interactions and let the pcs have a bond. Let the dialogue flow naturally. There is no reason to force stats on most NPCS, only stat a major villain and use the monster Manuel or basic level one stats for enemies (10 ac + armor, +2 attack/proff and weapon damage with 3-9 hp). If the players attack the blacksmith, have them just die (since they probably will) and let the consequences of killing someone in society affect them (guards, bounties, etc)\n\nCreate environments, not plots. This is important. A person can destroy a plot by saying they do not want to participate, but they cannot destroy the environment. The environment is also a lot more adaptable than a written plot that has stages in place. Make a plot after the players have done something to warrant it. Here is a good example of the difference: The party has been tasked to kill the leader of the thieves guild. (plot) The party is in a city and they are robbed by thieves. They then learn that the city has a thieves guild and want to get their stuff back. In doing so they are hostile towards the thieves guild which in turn makes the guild hostile to the party. (environment)\n\nLastly, talk to your players and do not stress too much. Tell them that you are new and would like some input and understanding right away. This will help you when you screw up since the players will be far more understanding and help you out rather than quit. Take it easy, and stay calm since you cannot fully prepare for player insanity. This will help you make better decisions quicker.\n\nIf you want more advice and help, I am trying to give people a newsletter to do just that.

rpg,t3_a2gkaq,"An alternative to mana/spell slotsHi!

So I've been working on my own RPG world. After a while of doing so I realized DnDs magic system just didn't fit with what I wanted for numerous reasons. So I tried making my own magic system.

My first thought went to what limitations my magic should have, since from the limitations you can get a better idea of what is possible. I quickly came to the conclusion that I disliked hard caps to magic usage, such as mana. I prefer instead a more organic soft cap. (A book or a movie with a sorcerer doesn't stop casting spells due to some arbitrary, unseen bank of mana, but rather because he's drained, tired or otherwise vulnerable).

My RPG takes place in a world where spirits of the elements are very prevalent so I started naturally with fire:
The limitation of fire is heat. While heat empowers a fire magician's spells it also threatens to consume the caster unless they are careful. (some specs will capitalize on this while other stay safer). A fire magician may off course cool down, but even low ranking spells run a low risk of generating enough heat to burn its user.

Next I went on to air:
Air is limited by how well they can ride the storm, i.e. how fast they can move. As long as they can keep up,  they can keep whipping up the wind, creating a fiercer and fiercer storm. This is of course very exhausting so eventually they get tired, which means generating wind becomes harder and harder.

Then I tried to tackle The Rock. Uh, earth:
This is where I started to struggle, due to lack of ideas. I finally landed on earth magic being rune based, requiring combinations of different runes for certain spells, giving certain effects. When given time an earth magician can prepare and infuse a rune, up to certain limit based on their skill within the magic school. 

Finally water:
When I first started thinking about water and spitballing ideas with a friend I thought of the idea to have two different 'states' the caster could be in: still and flowing. Still would represent ponds and lakes with both positive and negative (tranquility and healing, but also staleness and sickness). Flowing represents rivers, floods and oceans, with in turn their positive and negative effects. The idea was that to play a water caster well one would have to swing like a pendulum between the two states, making full use of their spells while also making sure to be in the 'right' state. But what would stop them from just doing their little spell shuffle all day? Ah, I figured I'll just give them (lore wise) an internal, spiritual well or pool from which they can drain to cast their spells. 


Then it hit me... THAT'S A FREAKING MANA POOL! Not only that, runes are just another hard cap, heck, it's even basically fancy mana with different types (like mtg mana colors). Granted, the runes fit more organically into the world, not being some arbitrary source, so those I accept. But the water spell resource system is just the kind i wanted to get away from! 

So if you made it this far, thank you. I might have gone off a bit on details, but that's only so you could help better answer this question:

TL;DR what kind of magic resource system can I use for water type spells that isn't mana or spell slots? 


EDIT: I will go go with the unlimited mana suggestion (consequences upon overspending a set pool). Thank you all for your many suggestions! I will leave the post up since there were alot of interesting tangential question about my magic system I'll gladly discuss, so if you're curious about anything, lmk! :)

EDIT2: Cool suggestions for water type specs would be nice! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a2gkaq/an_alternative_to_manaspell_slots/,"[""Are you familiar with dungeon world or DCC? Casting magic in these games require checks, and you can not only fail but can temporarilly (or permanently) loose the spell if you fail too hard.\n\nI personally did smthng like this:\nFor wizards, you make a check to cast the spell against a difficulty related to the spell's complexity. If you pass, the spell works, if you fail, it backfires. Spells that you cast directly from your spellbook don't backfire if you fail the check.\n\nSo there's no limit for spellcasting, and you get encouraged to actually write spells down and improve your spellcasting ability, in order to not waste your time while using magic. More powerful spells tho (think of *wish*), might have some limitations or higher risk/reward effects.\n"", ""Yes that is a mana pool, but it is actually a fairly cool idea that makes it different enough to be interesting. \n\nMaybe take the idea of the two states and instead use it to apply a bonus/penalty to casting rolls.

The more you keep trying to do the same kind of thing the harder and harder it gets, until you unleash the pent up force in the other direction. I'd probably have the entire bonus lost after one use, like a dam bursting or a flash-flood to keep things a bit in check. \n\nFor bonus points you could even expand into more than two groups.

Water based spells can either dehydrate plant life or a willing creature to function.  A caster could run it like blood magic.  ', 'I have a thought for Earth and water.  These may not be that helpful mechanically.  What if Earth magic needed to be cast from a solid foundation I.e. strongest from rest states.  The more Earth magic is ""disturbed"", the more upheaval there is such that spells become harder to predict and control.  \nFor water, I would probably just add a ""friction"" or ""evaporation"" mechanic to the movement between the two states, such that when there is a swing there is a loss of potency.  Maybe water, like Earth, is weakest in states of equal stillness and flow called ""turbulence"" or something, and if momentum in either state is not allowed to build, the condition becomes more turbulent and therefore ineffective.  ', 'An interesting water theme could be life and community. Let waters power be about joining with other individuals. If they are good at magic, they can use the flowing bond between other magic people to cast stronger spells, if they are great at magic, they can use the bonds they have with even non magic folk, and if they are top tier, they can even use the bonds they have with their enemies and other non willing participants.\n\nI think earth is kind of weak as well, no offense. Like fire is okay, but instead of heat exactly being the source, I think friction is better description because it is the thing that makes heat and light. And wind having to constantly shift and change is cool too. Maybe earth could be something about precision? Complete control over oneself? Something like that? I think magic is more interesting when emotions are a major factor, so fire being friction and conflicting passions makes sense, air being flighty and chaotically bending makes sense, earth works as very intentional and confident and resolved, and water is all about community and connectivity.', 'Sorry for not answering your question but commenting on your system so far:\n\nWhile I really like your innovative ideas for magic system and I think the world needs more such ideas here are some critiques:\n\n* Making Fire chance based has a high risk (pun intended) of annoying your players.

However I really like the idea of Heat goes up -&gt; failure chance goes up -&gt; light damage on failure, which is probably what you thought of anyway.  \nThough this would also enable the mage to cast infinitely provided she cools down inbetween. Otherwise if its ""so and so much heat is allowed per day"" its just a reverse mana pool.  \n\n* I really like how your Elements have different principles: Fire is based on having to controll your power to not be consumed, Air has opportunity cost in that it has to build up the storm for effect but will be ""out of breath"" if ever fails to control, Earth is steady in that it needs a lot of time and is very stationary but then has all the power of a mountain. GOOD WORK ON THAT!\n\nSo my question would be: What are the key elements of water? I would say that water can\'t choose if it is still or moving, but instead does what the surroundings make it do.\n\nOne could make water-mages such that they can only cast the spells which mirror the emotional state of the mage, so an enraged mage could not heal his allies mid fight, and could even do serious splash damage if he is enraged still after the fight ends. \n\nAlso one could do a dam analogy there: As long as everything is mentally fine the mage can heal and whatnot without real loss of power. If the dam breaks there is one HUGE effect but it will take a long time to regain that.', '[deleted]', '""Unlimited Mana"" is a great old push-your-luck magic system.

rpg,t3_a2ek98,"Making a RPG Rulebook and JourneyBooks(read campaign books) for a very niche audience, trying to guage interest and get suggestionsIts set in the Book of Mormon (mesoameria theory, heroic realism) with some influence from Dogs in the Vineyard and D&amp;D. Ive spent a long time fleshing out the details, and I found that i needed to create a new (to me) system to keep things simple. Also, idk how copyright on this works, would appreciate guidance.

I dont know where else to start, so i'd appreciate some questions.

A few questions from me:
I have a crafting system, a property system, an family of NPCs system, an inheiritence system for passing things down from one character to the next, and a made from scratch Faith/Testimony/miracle system. I feel like all of this is fine, but I am trying to keep the game mid to lightweight bc of my limited audience. Do you think I should split some of this into optional rules or keep all of these as core rulebook rules?

I found that I can really easily mod this into a Bible RPG, would this be worth the time? I feel that the grittyness might turn off the people who would be looking for something set in the Bible, but i figure id ask.

How do I copyright a thing? I want to be able post portions of my work without it getting copyrighted by someone else. Im a little paranoid, but still, would appreciate the help.

rpg,t3_a2eiac,"Converting Pathfinder to 5e, which books should I start with?Hi! My party is in the process of converting from Pathfinder to 5e, I’m the DM. I picked up the Player’s Handbook recently and intend to start converting any content from my stack of Pathfinder books to 5e.

My question is, simply, what 5e books are worth having? Whether to avoid complications converting from Pathfinder, for sake of ease, etc. Are there any really good resources on how to approach conversion? We do all homebrews so I don’t need any of the adventure paths.

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a2eiac/converting_pathfinder_to_5e_which_books_should_i/,"['The recent D&amp;D Basic Rules is a single, free, 180pp book covering all the rules and the core classes. You could start with that, and expand when you feel the need to. Since you already have the PHB, you can grab the bestiary, and compare 5e monsters to their PF counterparts. But the Basic Rules contain enough monsters to get you started.', ""If you are just starting 5e, I recommend thinking about whether you want to go the hard copy route or the digital route. DNDBeyond has some cool features that might be useful, but it can feel redundant to purchase both digital and hard copies. \n\nFor what books to get, you are definitely right to start with the Player's Handbook. I would say go with the Monster Manual next. Xanathar's Guide to everything is also probably a good book given that you are coming from Pathfinder. It contains a lot of character options as well as some other very useful stuff like more information on using tools. The Dungeon Master's Guide is also a good book. You probably don't need it right away, but 5e makes a lot of different assumptions that Pathfinder so it could be helpful in getting you out of the Pathfinder mindset to run 5e. It also contains magic items. There is also the free pdf Elemental Evil Player's Companion. I believe most of the spells are also in Xanathar's, but it also has some races and it's free.\n\nGuildmaster's Guide to Ravnica and Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide are setting books, and Volo's Guide to Monsters and Mordenkainan's Tome of Foes are monster books. These four books also contain some character options. My advice is that if you are going with hard copies to wait on these. If you are going with DND Beyond, you have the option to buy parts of the book and then the cost of the parts you have bought piecemeal is taken off of the price of the rest of the product if you decide to buy it later. You could use this method to buy the just the character options you need to convert your player's characters. I would probably wait on these, but it is an option you should be aware of.\n\nFinally, while I wouldn't recommend you start homebrewing yourself until your have experience with the system, subclasses and races are not that hard to homebrew in 5e and there are some widely accepted as good homebrews. If you ask or look around on some of the 5e subreddits (r/unearthedarcana is the homebrew sub), you'll probably be able to find some good stuff."", 'I do keep hearing Xanathar’s is worth while.', 'The three core books are the meat of the system (PHB, MM, DMG).\n\nOf those, the PHB is the core of the rule system. Basically all players and DM\'s have the PHB. A bunch of people on here will talk about the ""Basic Rules PDF,"" but that\'s not the full game (!). It\'s missing some races and classes that are part of the PHB and that basically all players will expect to be able to use. As a result, the PHB is really necessary unless the players and DM agree that they will only use the more limited Basic Rules.\n\nBeyond that, the MM is the next most important book, because without that, your options for monsters will be very limited. Need a lich? Well, you need to look it up in the MM. There isn\'t really any getting around that. It\'s necessary for DM\'s, but not for players.\n\nFinally, the DMG is mostly important for magical items and world-building ideas. That is to say, much less important than PHB and MM. If you want to do more homebrew magic items and you feel comfortable with that, then the DMG is really quite optional. You can probably put this one off until you actually think it would be really helpful or necessary.\n\nOutside the three core books for the system, Xanathar\'s guide has quite a few extra classes and options. It is the first and only general expansion of the core game. You don\'t need to use it, but if you want all the bells and whistles of new classes, spells, etc., then you may want it.\n\nThat\'s basically it. Wizards has done a pretty good job of keeping the core game rules all in the three traditional books (PHB, MM, DMG). They made an effort to do so for 5E because they made the mistake of not doing so for some previous editions, and alienated many gamers as a result.', ""The Holy trilogy (phb, dmg, mm) is what you need the most. Xanathar is a must-have IMHO, especially when trying to find a close match for a class selection. Volo's and Mordenkainen's guides contain a lot of very handy monsters, but keep in mind you'll never find as much diversity as you'll find in Pathfinder (for class options or monsters). Just saying so you won't be disappointed. I made the switch too but I never looked back.\n\nPS: Kobold Press's Tome of Beasts is also an amazing acquisition if you want a wider and more exotic variety of monsters. "", ""I don't know specifically, but are you converting specific *characters* to 5e or just, you know, switching systems for a new game? If the latter, whichever books are necessary for a starter kit then whatever you want. If the former, then hoo boy. What books have the best rule analogues for your characters?"", 'Watch Runehammer on youtube. He has a vid recommending not converting but simply taking monsters 1 to 1 from PF to 5e. Controversial maybe, but great to watch. May save you some money too ', ""If you're on a budget and don't want to collect the whole set of 5e books, go with dndbeyond."", ""Well, we only have the core book so far, so I'd wait for *Emerald Empire* so you have more to work with.""]"
rpg,t3_a2e6fs,"Fantasy campaign that starts with transporting characters to a different world. Should I warn my players about this?One of the campaigns I'm planning is set in a non-traditional fantasy world. It's probably not *that* original, but I try to present something that's different from the traditional West-European pseudo-medieval style. As system I'm planning on using GURPS, Savage Worlds or Genesys. If my players insist on a d20 system, then probably Shadow of the Demon Lord.

My idea is that the characters come, in fact, from a pretty standard western European Fantasyland. The backdrop is that there's a war and the characters form a party that's tracking down a villain of the Enemy's side. The party may confront their quarry, but in the commotion they're somehow teleported into a whole another world.

The other world is loosely based on Southeast Asia and I'm drawing inspiration from ancient Cambodian and Thai Empires. But the point is that the world is something completely alien to the characters. The magic might work differently, they don't know the languages, they're not familiar with the weapons or equipment that's available, etc. 

But the big question is: **Do I tell the players any of this before the campaign starts?**. I'd really like to surprise them and see how they respond to a completely new situation. But on the other hand they might not like the campaign premise and I wouldn't want to force them into anything. And this probably makes much of their backstory irrelevant. This becomes especially problematic if I use a point-buy system like GURPS or Savage Worlds where they might have invested in something (like Connections or Patrons) they're unable to use once in the new world.

I'm setting this up so that the main theme would be exploration, finding about the history of the new world and most importantly getting back home. My rudimentary idea is that the characters are not the first newcomers to the world, but there has been at least hundreds of years before the last batch and most of their deeds has been forgotten. One idea I like is that the languages in the new world might have some lingering effect of old Common, Elven or Dwarven from the world the characters are from, which would indicate that the last ones that came through did leave some mark to the new world. While the characters are exploring the world, try to make their ends meet and research ways to get home, there are cataclysmic events in the new world they may find difficult to ignore.

It's also fine if the characters *don't want* to return since I have quite a lot of content for a prolonged stay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a2e6fs/fantasy_campaign_that_starts_with_transporting/,"['Tell them, and have the actual transportation thing be part of the backstory.

You should tell them it will happen, but no need to tell them what is on the other side.', ""&gt; Do I tell the players any of this before the campaign starts?. \n\nabsolutely. \n\n&gt; But on the other hand they might not like the campaign premise and I wouldn't want to force them into anything.\n\nBy not telling the, forcing is what your doing. And if they aren't into the idea of the game, they are just gonna bail anyway. So all your really doing is saving yourself the time and effort from setting up the game and having it come apart when you pull the rug out from under them."", 'You could play a session -3 to -1 with pre gen characters and then have them teleported. This new world also drastically changes the character of each person which explains how they are all new from before but still know each other and you got your twist. ', ""Yes. They should build their characters without too many background ties and knowing they're going to someplace else after the campaign begins."", ""I'm going to say it isn't always a bad idea to do this. However, for it to work, it requires a great deal of trust and flexibility from the players, which you definitely shouldn't just expect. \n\nEven if you do have that kind relationship with your players, I don't recommend exploiting it like that very often."", 'Both as a DM and a player, my advice is to definitely keep your party in the loop. It\'ll make things run smoother and secure accurate expectations (and hype) for the campaign. I also strongly believe in the idea that if your party won\'t/can\'t advance the campaign because they don\'t have certain information or know the right direction, make sure at least one or two of the players know *something*.\n\nI.e., There\'s the ""common"" language in most DnD worlds, depending on where it\'s set, so maybe keep it in this new world as well so the players at least have a chance at understanding all of the other foreign elements. There should be new and foreign languages / jargon / culture, but make sure there\'s something for the players to hold onto. And if there\'s important lore / history / etc. that the characters would know in game, make sure they have that information as well. ', ""If they're really invested in the medieval European setting with large backstories and expectations that they'll get to develop those stories, they might not like the bait and switch. If they're just there for whatever game you're choosing to run come hell or high water, and are willing to roll with however the story falls out, they'll be fine with it, I think. Personally I'd love to have this hidden from me as a player, but the GM I used to play with usually ran sandbox campaigns where we didn't have expectations for how the campaign would go after our feet hit the pavement, so to speak. So really the question you should be asking yourself is how tolerant is your group of having their expectations subverted, if indeed they have any expectations at all. We, as random strangers in the internet, cannot know this for you, so our advice isn't for you, but for ourselves. I'd say go for it and surprise them, but I'm not in your group."", 'For me it depends on my relationship with the players. If I don’t know the players well, or we haven’t developed lots of trust, then tell them everything and get explicit buyin. No surprises.\n\nIf it is a group I know well—I know their likes and dislikes, I know their playstyles, they know and like and trust my GMing style, they know that I will design a game with their preferences in mind, then I won’t tell them exactly what is happening. I’ve done this a couple of times, actually—all using GURPS.\n\nOnce was a gradual reveal, once was a big sudden break, the other was a massive sudden break.\n\nThe gradual reveal was for a Cthulhupunk game I told them was a cyberpunk game. I knew all of them liked horror, so that wasn’t going to be a problem, and the reveal had lots of foreshadowing and happened slowly. They could have resisted the supernatural and I would have been able to backpedal, but they leaned into it and it had a really great slow burn where the reveal was a great part of it. I have them no pre-game reveal, but I did hand them some handouts where I purposefully didn’t blackout the word “Cthulupunk” properly so they could think they figured out a secret of the campaign without me knowing they knew.\n\nThe big break was a swashbuckling game where they all started off as retainers in a minor court. They are presented with an opportunity to help someone in the first session that causes them to flee the kingdom and be on the run. It upended everything, but they did have a choice (I knew they were going to go for it though because I knew the players). I gave them no reveal beforehand.\n\nThe last one was a Banestorm dimension hopping game. I told them to make people who would go out on a three hour boat tour off the coast of California and told them that there would be a massive twist, but didn’t tell them what the twist was.  They all signed on...and then they were Banestormed.  Worked well. But they knew something was going to happen...just not what.', ""I think a middle-ground might provide the best solution. Let the players know that there will be some significant travel away from the starting area so they don't invest heavily in things tied to that region. Don't invalidate their builds. If they make choices and invest character resources into something that won't be useful in the new area, allow them to respec after a session of readjustment (allows them to buy into some of the newly available stuff they're encountering). Surprises aren't terrible, so long as the players don't feel like you're unfairly taking away their toys. "", '[deleted]', ""Thanks for the advice! After reading your comments I'm conviced that it's better to tell the players about the campaign premise and hear what they think. And even if I tell them that the campaign would take place in a foreign world, I don't have to give all the secrets away.""]"

At least that my opinion, my wife is not enjoying the game because she tries to get XP but does not. I personally when DMing always gave out equal XP.  I don't like anyone to feel left out.

Different amounts of xp for different players is one, and not getting xp when you feel you should is another. \n\nIf your wife is trying to get xp and isn't, she should really talk to the GM. Clearly there is a disconnect between what the GM thinks should get xp and what your wife thinks.If that doesn't work, you might just need to find a new GM.\n\nAs for PCs having different levels of XP, I do that in almost every game I run. I like to think I'm pretty fair about it though. If someone had a problem with it and didn't tell me, well, there's really nothing I can do about that, is there? I like it, some of the people who have played in my games said they liked it, if that's all the info I have to go on, then I'm going to keep doing it.\n\nSo, no, I don't think it's a poor way to GM. I do think that talking to your GM about what you like and dislike is important though."", 'As GM I enjoy the gameist idea of giving exp for the meta-game (i.e. exp to the player not the character). In my groups I have handled that by giving each player some exp they have to give to other players with a reasoning.\n\nThus at the evening there is often stuff like:\n\nA: ""I give the extra exp to B because she just lost so much in this adventure""\n\nB: ""I\'ll give the extra exp to C because he saved me in the fight""\n\nC: ""I\'ll also give my exp to B because of the damage being done to her by the adventure""\n\nD: ""What C said.""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure that may make A and D feel left out because they did not get ""extra"" exp, and the ""extra"" exp tend to accumulate for some people, but I don\'t think this has ever been a big problem to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dislike the Idea of giving it out personally for ""random reasons"", but I see the appeal in that. In groups where the GM wants to encourage players to roleplay more (i.e. not only rolling dice) this can be an effective mean of encouragement. And as we all know: encouragement is better then punishment (i.e. telling the ""face"" of the group that she did very good in her attempt to roleplay  when she tried to convince the police that the group was not murder-hoboing through the city and give some XP for that is better in my regard then to tell her ""well start to roleplay"" whenever she has no idea how to act that scene out and just wants to roll)', '""good role-playing"" seems pretty vague.  and if it\'s just the GM who awards it that seems too open to unintended favoritism.

That said, in my opinion there are far too many different playstyles nowadays for a lot of things like this to be considered ""poor"" DMing. \n\nAs far as the content of your post goes, it sounds like you have far different expectations than your DM does. If a player, in this case your wife, is unhappy, she should talk to the DM about it. You seem unhappy as well, and should also talk to your DM.\n\nWhile things such as what you talked about are not my preferred playstyle, I don\'t really see anything wrong with it if that\'s what a group wants to do. I don\'t like to reward individuals for good roleplaying with anything other than an in-game result for said roleplaying because *in my own opinion*, rewarding for good roleplaying is more of a punishment to shy or quiet players as well as players who struggle with creative or well thought out roleplaying. ', 'Remember, everybody wants something different out of RPGs. Some people just like being part of the story, some people like being powerful, some people just want to act and play a character. The DM is trying to encourage people to role play. You and your wife like being mechanically powerful. Those two goals are conflicting because of this mechanic.\n\nYou should talk to your GM to see if you can reach a better compromise.

To me, that means she doesn\'t understand how to get XP or XP awards are not being distributed in a system that is easy to understand.\n\nRewarding players for good roleplay is STUPID!!! The result is that the player who gets the GM\'s ear the most gets the XP.  So it becomes not a battle for good roleplay, but a battle for attention.  Not everyone does well in that environment regardless of their ability to roleplay well. \n\nEqual distribution of XP doesn\'t work either.  That player who is on their phone the whole game watching Netflix and can\'t bother to pay attention until it is time to roll gets the same XP as the guy who is solving all of the puzzles.  That is simply unfair.\n\nThe GM has to come up with a system that allows a fair distribution of XP that allows players to play the way they want to play within their abilities.  In other words, a system that rewards players for playing, with small bonuses for being present in the game.  \n\nReally what needs to happen is XP needs to be tossed in favor of milestone-based advancement.

It\'s fun, especially since characters bite the dust all the time. \n\nBut it would be completely irritating to have XP awarded on a subjective basis, especially when you\'re doing your best to try and get it. Sounds like a kind of issue where you need to talk to the GM about what constitutes ""good roleplaying.""', 'I have two problems with XP awards for ""best roleplaying"".\n\nThe first is the one you already mentioned. I don\'t believe in awarding different amounts of XP to my players. In the long term it only serves to build a competitive nature in a cooperative game and even if you are going for a competitive style, a much shorter-term ressource is the better idea (as with Paranoia XPs perversity points).\n\nThe second is a bit more subtle. While I get the notion of ""more roleplaying = more good"" (where roleplaying usually just means talking in character), it really forces a style of play, that not everyone is comfortable with. There are a lot of people who enjoy every *other* aspect of RPGs but are lousy at talking in-character. Be it because they don\'t have the acting talent, the improvisation necessary or the charisma to do it. Punishing those players for not doing something uncomfortable for them just serves to reduce their fun in game.\n\nWith that being said, there is absolutely no problem if a table wants to encourage or even enforce talking in character, if everyone agrees to that. But even then, there are *much* better tools than just awarding XP to the one who did it best. Ruling all talk as in-character is one such measure.', 'Thank you, I was unsure if it was just me trying to push my DM style on to someone else', ""It is bad for the method of advancement to be unclear. Good roleplaying is subjective and if a  singular person is the judge such as the gm then there will be weird unequal advancement and disappointment. \n\nIf everyone wants to use this as a metric for XP be clear how much and let all the players be the judge. \n\nLook at Blades in the Dark for example, it is the players who declare how much XP they get based on their xp triggers. They are the final judge of this although other players can help them or remind them of XP moments. \n\nOverall I don't have any specific issues with players advancing at different rates as long as it is clear how players advance their character."", 'why don´t you make a communal xp bank. and they all level up and get extra xp for rp', 'I think individual XP rewards are questionable in the first place mechanical reasons.  Though system dependent, individual XP rewards usually results in a growing logistical nightmare when XP gaps form in the party (such as a 2+ level gap in DnD5e).\n\nBut as for roleplaying rewards, many times I feel like GMs who don\'t do a lot of thinking about the rewards will often fall into the trap of the ""Big Mouth Award"".  In other words Roleplaying becomes equated with the loudest and/or funny player who speaks in the first person rather than any other form of roleplaying.  If there is to be a roleplay reward I think it works best using a ""Objective"" method.  The character has a guiding objective and they demonstrate through their play that they are seeking to fulfill it (whether they do achieve the objective or doesn\'t matter too much) to receive the reward.  But again...individual xp reward depending on the system needs to be controlled to avoid severe character power gaps.', ""One of the things I use to do when Dm'ing was give PC's experience for a number of things.\n\nGood role-playing, keeping track of in game things like NPC's, timelines, what all happened last session, bringing food/drinks for people, writing character bios/backstories, finishing character goals/arcs, making maps, helping out people with creating their characters (if wanted), etc.\n\nBasically anything that adds to the game world or to the player's enjoyment of the game were rewarded. So is someone is personally charismatic and knows how to do interesting and intriguing role-playing yes they get rewarded for that, and it serves as an incentive for the others to try as well. But if someone just can't do that, but they make awesome short stories, then they can get rewarded for making up stuff about their character, or making up new NPC's for me to utilize later. Or if they just can't do much other than show up and whack some orcs, then hey if they want they could buy a $12 of Mountain Dew to share and get rewarded for that. \n\nBy the way the XP boosts were never anything huge, but over time they could add up. Usually the only real difference it made was leveling up a session, or maybe two, earlier than the person in the back. The way I see it is it encouraged everyone to give a little bit extra, or try something new, and the indulge deeper into the lore of the campaign/characters then they would previously."", 'I find it works better in point based systems than level based systems. ', ""Most of how I feel is covered already, except this:  If you aren't having fun because you aren't getting XP - you may be focusing on the wrong thing.  Most roleplaying games are about more that just getting more powerful and leveling up."", 'Other people talked the random XP rewards to death, so I\'m going to comment on:\n\n&gt; my wife is not enjoying the game because she tries to get XP but does not\n\nWhile you\'re not likely to get the DM to change the style of game they\'re running, this particular aspect is a potentially solvable problem. I\'d recommend talking to the DM out of game, if possible on their own without other players around. Your wife should say that she\'d like to get in on the XP reward action and ask for ideas. She could phrase this like ""I\'d like to become a better role player, and right now the feedback I\'m getting through the lack of XP rewards is that I\'m not doing so well. Do you have any suggestions for me?""\n\nSee what the DM says. If I were DMing, I\'d try to talk her through some moments where I thought her character might really have been able to shine, but didn\'t. (""Remember back when you were negotiating with the thieves guild? Your character has history with the boss there. I\'d designed that moment for her to shine, but she didn\'t speak up. Was there a particular reason why?"") Maybe I notice that there\'s habits she has that aren\'t tending towards the RP-intensive game I\'d prefer to run(such as a tendency to approach things out of character and take only the optimal path, rather than going with what the character would do), and I might mention those. I\'d certainly now be aware that she was trying to improve though, and would go out of my way to watch for her attempts and reward them(with the hope that she\'d improve through practice and encouragement, even if her attempts weren\'t amazing at first).\n\nI don\'t know your DM, or your wife, so I can\'t really say what sort of results the conversation might have. But I\'d say it\'s the only step forward that makes sense. If you\'re otherwise enjoying the game, why walk away over this one thing? At least try talking it through like adults first.', '1. Ask him what he considers good roleplaying. If your wife considers good roleplaying to be a clear voice and funny mannerisms (for example), why he considers it to be significant character beats (for example), that may be where the problem is.\n\n2.

The reward usually goes to whoever talks the most, or whoever talks to plot NPCs the most, but doesn't acknowledge all the other RP at the table.  "", 'I never had that kind of problems. If someone was leveling up faster than me, who cares? it´s just a game, not a competition. If i get a reward for something i said or did, well, welcome! \n\nAnd as a DM i liked to reward the good game (with XP) as much as punishing the bad one (usually with temporary disvantages). I never get a complain.', 'Irregular leveling is baked into quite a lot of systems. Typically the Rogue type character has the easiest leveling and might be 2 levels higher than the classes with a more difficult progression table. The most popular games have gone away from this but had it before. You\'d have to ask the designers if it was discarded for reasons of simplicity or because it was found to be ""bad"".\n\nYour GM probably thinks these rewards are a way to encourage participation, and if the group doesn\'t like it, the GM may very well stop doing it.']"
rpg,t3_a2d66a,"Mothership by Sean McCoy is December's Game of the Month[The votes are in](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/9y5zk7/december_game_of_the_month_voting_thread/) and ***Mothership*** by Sean McCoy joins [our esteemed list of previous winners](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/wiki/contestwinners) as **December’s Game of the Month**!!

 I’m going to go ahead and quote the winning pitch from /u/throneofsalt

&gt;I nominate Mothership. It's a d100 sci-fi/horror system, perfect for running Alien or Event Horizon, but it is most importantly exceptionally well designed. Every subheading is numbered for reference, character sheets have flowchart arrows pointing you towards important points, and it hits the sweet spot niche of hard sci-fi without overwhelming crunch.

&gt;Plus it's PWYW.

&gt;I spent four days in a fugue state making a sandbox for this game out of excitement for the potential of playing it and that's some of the highest praise I can give a game. 


And we can add the author's drivethrurpg pitch from the site:

&gt;  **Mothership** is a sci-fi horror roleplaying game where you and your crew try to survive in the most inhospitable environment in the universe: outer space! You'll excavate dangerous derelict spacecraft, explore strange unknown worlds, exterminate hostile alien life, and examine the horrors that encroach upon your every move. Choose from one of four classes:

&gt;* **Teamsters**, the rough and tumble workers. More versatile at first level, Teamsters can be anything from engineers, to pilots, to asteroid miners. If Ripley from Aliens is your hero, then you'll want to play a Teamster.

&gt;* **Scientists**, doctors, researches or anyone who wants to slice open aliens (or infected crew members) with a scalpel. Become an expert in genetics or xenobiology - or protect your crew from deadly viruses.

&gt;* **Androids** are an exciting and terrifying addition to any crew. Powerful due to their supreme intellect, speed, and near-immunity to fear, they tend to unnerve other crew members with their cold inhumanity.

&gt;* **Marines** are here to shoot bugs and chew bubblegum. They're handy in a fight, and better when grouped together, but be wary when a marine panics because it could spell doom for the rest of your crew.

I’ll try to reach out to the author to see if they are interested in doing an AMA or following this thread, and I will update when they respond. :)

If you have any experience with the game and want to share it with us, or discuss your favourite parts of the game or the system with others, feel free to start a discussion thread, or share them in this thread here. Let us know what you think of this game and why people should play it.

You can acquire Mothersip from [DTRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/245017) here for a PWYW (PayWhatYouWant) price.

If you know and want to recommend us any Actual Plays or game reviews please do so in the comments below. We'd also love to hear your personal experiences playing the game! Those are the most important for us, and are the real reason for these monthly threads, so please feel free to share them with us. :)

rpg,t3_a2crkq,"Looking for a dungeon map builderHello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've come here for advice. I'm creating a big campaign and I'm looking for a dungeon map builder app. I know there are a lot out there, and I'm looking through them, but maybe you can help me pointing to the one I need. This is what I'm looking for:

&amp;#x200B;

\- First of all I want to map Undermountain, from D&amp;D. For those who don't know it it's a huge dungeon with 9 levels and 14 sublevels. I have all the original material and I would like to transfer it to the computer.

\- This is meant to be a resource for me (the DM). I won't use it with the players, so I don't need fog of war or sharing characteristics.

\- I need an easy-to-draw 2D map builder. That it has a grid so I just have to drag&amp;drop to create a room of the squares I need.

\- I would like to be able to attach text boxes with descriptions to the rooms or areas, so there would be objects that when I click on them, a popup, or text box in one side, appears with the description and details of that room.

\- I would need to be able to create links in the staiwarys/access between one level to another, so I would know when the players use one, which is its correspondant in the next level. I know I could just label them, but each level is huge so it would be a great help. Also there are portals that teleports you to other levels.

rpg,t3_a28pv6,"Do people still enjoy being challenged?So having gotten familiar with the D&amp;D 5e rules I have noticed that this version of the game has been designed to be very 'easy'.

* Ability scores are rolled with 4d6 drop lowest, resulting in most characters having few particularly poor abilities, and the player can assign them however they like, meaning that they can just assign any bad scores to stats their class doesn't use much.  This leads to characters not really having strengths and weaknesses, just strengths.
* XP requirements are really low for levels 1-3.
* It's really hard to die.  Everyone gets pretty generous hp at level 1, and even if you lose all of them in combat you still have around 3-5 rounds before you die during which you have an equal chance of stabilizing.  It only take one round (6 seconds) for someone to stabilize a dying character which is completely unrealistic.
* Challenge ratings are designed so that a 'balanced encounter' is one where the characters will definitely win if they apply minimal tactical thinking.

I've also noticed a bit of a trend in the D&amp;D culture where people seem to think that being challenged is un-fun.  Specifically, people think that their characters should be invincible.

* Anecdotally, I've heard DM's talk about fudging damage rolls that would take down a PC and I've heard a number of people say that they think that a PC death is a failure of the DM.
* I've watched a couple of Matt Colville's videos in which he talks about players getting angry at him when their characters die as a result of their own bad choices, and where he acts like they were completely justified in feeling that way.

What do you think about this current trend?  A partial explanation I have is that people put a lot more effort into their character's personality and backstory these days and they get very attached, so their character having some dud ability scores or getting killed might be seen as a waste of their effort.  Personally I find playing in a campaign where I know there is no risk of failure to be incredibly dull.

Some sort of OSR system might be."", '[deleted]', '""4d6, drop the lowest"" has been around for thirty-nine years. It was in the original AD&amp;D Dungeon Master\'s Guide. \n\nI don\'t think that counts as a ""current trend.""', 'I don’t think your analysis of 5e is especially insightful or accurate, but yes, people’s preference for challenge varies greatly.  RPGs are not one size fits all.  People play them in very different ways hopping to get very different things from them.  This is also true of any version of DnD.\n\nComparing abilities scores between versions isn’t especially meaningful.  Versions vary in where you start and where you end up.  5e caps your stats at 20, and doesn’t automatically provide a ton of magic items to boost things further, and the number of magic items is limited.\n\n5e is designed to be more “heroic”, I think, from the start.  1st Level character’s aren’t incompetent nobodies, and they get cool class abilities sooner and faster than some previous versions.  But that’s not the same thing as “easy”.  First level characters can die in one hit.\n\nEasy or hard is created in the difference between your power and the power of your obstacles.  And like always the DM has a big part in that.', ""I kind of disagree that this is any kind of trend. People have got mad about their characters dying for as long as D&amp;D has been around. My dad has told me plenty of stories of OD&amp;D and AD&amp;D players coming to the table and wanting to be a badass withour the fear of getting their character killed, to the point where they would argue and cheat to get out of it. I see no signs that there has been an uptick in that sort of behavior, though I wouldn't doubt that you may have observed it in your own circles.\n\nI'm also just not sure I agree with you about how lethal 5e is. For example, you mention that the way CR is set up, you're pretty much guaranteed to win an encounter of your same level. But you should also realize that in 3e and 3.5e, it was actually far worse. I had difficulty getting RAW encounter design to even expend players resources, even hitpoints--and that's partially because of a stylistic move in the OPPOSITE direction.\n\nSee, originally, D&amp;D was a resource game. Finding safe places to rest was difficult because everyone friggin' loved to have random encounters. You tried to push as far as you could and even though no individual fight had ANY CHANCE of killing a character, you really had to think: do I blow a fireball here just so we don't lose any more hitpoints, or should I kust hang back and let the fighter get beat up so i could use it later? Every edition after 3rd has chipped away at that trend, moving it from a resource focus to a tactical one. 4e saw a peak where basically every combat had to be slightly deadly and challenging because the whole point was to be playing each fight like it was a tabletop strategy battles game.\n\nIs 5e less deadthany than 4e? Probably, because it moved back towards resource-based play... but a lot of people went straight from 3.5 and Pathfinder straight to 5e, skipping the set-piece battles of 4e entirely... and I'd definitely say 5e is more lethal than either of those systems."", '&gt;A partial explanation I have is that people put a lot more effort into  their character\'s personality and backstory these days and they get very  attached, so their character having some dud ability scores or getting  killed might be seen as a waste of their effort.  Personally I find  playing in a campaign where I know there is no risk of failure to be  incredibly dull.  Keen to hear how other people feel about it!\n\nPretty much. Nobody wants to spend hours crafting a character for them to get taken down in the first round of combat against a low level monster. The popularity of the OSR shows that there are still plenty of fans who want the older style of game though.\n\nOlder style games (whether they identify as OSR or not) require some crucial elements I feel:\n\n1. All the players need to be aware of and on-board with the high lethality, low character prep nature of the game before you start.\n2. Character creation needs to be fast, if it takes over 15 minutes to make a character the system is probably wrong for this playstyle.\n3. Combat can\'t be the primary source of leveling. You need something else, whether it\'s milestone/quest leveling or XP for GP like older D&amp;D did it. Because if you can only really advance mechanically with combat players will always want to pursue combat whether it fits their character or not, it goes against the ""combat as war"" mentality.', ""None of those factors preclude running a challenging game, and independent of that, just being a high-randomness meatgrinder isn't necessarily challenging.

Rather than being able to fail like Han Solo fails over and over as a method of having challenge and stakes but the stakes not actually be 'Well, make a new character'"", 'well if you come to play D&amp;D you came to have a ""from zero to hero"" exp that is well suited to long term play. if you want to play a hard rpg, is very hard to justify (long term) the ""new characters"" that join the party each day', ""Risk of failure is one thing, but when you turn it up too high then it just feels like you're at the mercy of RNG. That's just how tabletop RPG's are. And people are starting to realize that dying purely due to bad rolls isn't fun, or challenging.

Also challenge Ratings are a guideline to help you estimate how well an encounter will stack up against your PCs; you don't have to follow them at all, and you can also use them to build difficult encounters.\n\n&gt;I've  also noticed a bit of a trend in the D&amp;D culture where people seem  to think that being challenged is un-fun.  Specifically, people think  that their characters should be invincible.\n\nNo they don't. Or rather, there have always been individual players like that. It's not new and it's not a trend. People want to have \\*competent\\* characters, sure. They want to be able to contribute to the game in some meaningful way.

Being able to go from full heath to permanently dead in a single die roll isn\'t a challenge, that\'s chance, and I doubt there\'s ever been a player happy to see their character gone like that.\n\n5e is without a doubt designed to avoid player frustration- no save or dies, stuff like mind control can be resisted every round, generous healing on rests etc. I feel like your character always matters in some way, which makes it far easier to play it as, well, an RPG and not a wargame.\n\nFirsthand, 5e can still be as lethal as you want it to. Even in a stereotypical, close quarters dungeon fight a dropped character is always going to have a monster by them and it should be difficult to get to that character undisturbed for even that one turn with a character down. A critical hit can still easily drop most low-level characters in one swing.', 'I think your statement is a bit wide. I would loathe to play in a D&amp;D campaign where I had to really carefully think about fighting all the time because I hate that sort of roleplaying.

Unless I am forcing an encounter on my players, I don't really even use it. It can also be deceptive since some monsters are pretty damn strong for their CR.\n\nThat said 5e is not about disposable characters. It can support that playstyle but something like dungeon crawl classics might work better."", 'Welcome to a hobby being broad enough to have different expectations and preferences. The OSR and horror gaming are that way.', 'As others have said, tastes can and do vary. But I think the trend is real and it is related to how tabletop RPG fits into people\'s lives. I started playing RPGs in \\~1980. At our house we had three TV channels. There was no Internet. Video games were certainly a thing, but they weren\'t yet being designed with the explicit goal of getting people addicted to them. The alternative to burying myself in an RPG was either reading a book (which I did quite a lot of and still had plenty of time left over), do something outside (which is great except at night or when the weather sucks), or watch Gilligan\'s Island reruns. \n\nI spent countless hours prepping my campaigns. We looked down our noses at ""Monty Haul"" GMs, and character advancement was much, much slower than is the norm now, especially when you factor in just how many hours we put into our games. It wasn\'t uncommon for us to have pretty high mortality rate in our games as well.\n\nNow as an adult I have only a fraction of the time I had as a teenager for prep. And as a player I\'m OK with character death but there are far more things competing for my time than there were back in the Analog Age of my youth. I suspect that\'s the case for most people, of any age. The world is teeming with entertainments of all sorts, from the Golden Age of TV, to social media, to MMOGs that make money by getting people hooked on them. \n\nA gritty, challenging RPG campaign is a great thing (and that\'s the sort of campaign I still tend to run) but the context in which tabletop RPGs operate has changed radically. We\'re no longer in an age of scarcity. We\'re in an age of overabundance, and instead of looking for things to do in their leisure time, people often have to trim out other leisure activities to make room for tabletop roleplaying. And if all those other pursuits are relatively unchallenging, an RPG that back in the day might have seemed only moderately challenging now appears more difficult.', ""People don't like having their time wasted. \nThey don't want to put hours of game time and months of actual time on a character just so they can get killed by a failed death save or a trap that kills instantly\n\nSave or die was always shit."", '&gt;Ability scores are rolled with 4d6 drop lowest, resulting in most characters having few particularly poor abilities, and the player can assign them however they like, meaning that they can just assign any bad scores to stats their class doesn\'t use much.

There are plenty of people playing these games who also feel that 5E does not suit their preferences (too high power, too hand-holding). There is another subreddit for that community at:\n\n/r/osr\n\nAlternately, if you really do like 5E but just want a tougher game, either increase the challenge as a DM (tougher encounters), or modify the rules to allow for some kind of meat-grinder mode that makes player death more possible. Then make sure all players have a backup character ready just in case...\n\nI also dislike challenge ratings, and think that player death is sometimes natural and normal. The challenge rating stuff especially bothers me, because it presumes that PC's should engage with every group of enemies, and will never need to run away or sneak past enemies. It can also be stifling in the sense that it presumes that fighting is the solution to everything, so ways of using the environment to help defeat enemies becomes irrelevant. Hence adventures and environments in which fighting is the solution to every conflict.\n\nI attended a panel by D&amp;D designers before, and they basically said that over time, their market research showed them that new players wanted to have the feeling of being heroic. As a result, the imagery in D&amp;D books tended towards action scenes in which characters were in dynamic and heroic poses, like superheroes. By contrast, the D&amp;D books of the 70s and 80s tended to portray characters as vulnerable and sometimes frightened. There was more of a survival horror type bent to the game."", 'I also have noticed this. Mind it may be just a trend and may be biased to what we see on our social media sites or in our own groups. I think it\'s something interesting to discuss. I think this mentality comes from a significant portion of the community whom also play video games, or whom are fans of various groups streaming RPGs. I also think it\'s something that may have evolved over the years in North American (/western) culture, to expect success with investment.\n\nI think video games have trained us to expect success, to see failure as unfun and to see our characters as the most important people in the world. In video games, you typically expect to reach the ""end of the game"" no matter how much you mess up, die, or are unable to reach a certain skill level. As a player who bought the game, you have a right to experience the content. Concepts like ""fairness"" and ""balance"" have a core place in each player\'s experience, end-to-end. For games with a more open design, devs must account for players looking up every solution on the internet, finding ""bugs"" to succeed where they shouldn\'t and artificially amplifying resources. Losing is always unfun, but immediately followed by a ""reset"", ""reload"" or ""resurrect"". Unless the story has been orchestrated along a particular path where the character dies at the end, very rarely do you lose (I can think of one... nuclear example that\'s still a... far cry from a comparable experience in RPGs).\n\nIn online streams, the audience gets attached to specific characters, so unexpected deaths of fan favorites will never let that popular arc be explored, those comic relief memes to spread... The fact that the box is open and watched, and that streamers benefit from it (with money and/or followers) changes the games dynamic. Arguably, it could give certain characters plot armor. Then, when those audience members play a game of their own, they expect it to work similarly to what they\'ve seen in streams; they expect a full, satisfying exploration of their arc, and no premature curtain closures. \n\nFinally, I think it\'s possible that this is something that\'s evolved in our western culture over time. A good parallel is post-secondary education in North America. A common sentiment among NA educators is that grade averages have risen, failure is less common and students expect more success. Students seem more likely to argue for higher grades on the basis that they invested in the course, either by paying, attending or studying. I think it\'s possible that, especially in NA, investment in something (time/energy/money) brings the expectation of success. When that expectation isn\'t met, there\'s a feeling of unfairness (but I invested in that character/story!) leading to conflict or discontinuation of the campaign. This is of course subjective anecdotal experience and it doesn\'t really support my argument, but I find it interesting: I play d&amp;d often in both Canada and in Belgium, and groups in Belgium have much less expectation of success and victory than Canadian groups. There\'s an underlying current of ""everything should be balanced"" in the Canadian groups, and an implicit understanding that a TPK means campaign over. In the Belgian groups, encounters are rarely (if ever) fair, usually leaning more toward what you\'d expect for the situation or story. Unintelligent or nasty monsters often attack unconscious or dying players and despite the drama or sadness (often with some laughter), the game always goes on without trouble. I\'ve seen many partys ""fail"" and tragedies fall upon communities or players in the BE groups. In the Canadian groups, I\'ve seen a player quit because they got hit with feeblemind and it was ""a broken mechanic"". Of course this is much more likely to just be down to differences of the people between the two tables, but how much of those differences are due to this cultural factor? Just interesting to think about. \n\nInteresting post I\'ve thought about before. Lots of interesting thoughts in the comments, below, too.', ""Oh, boy. \n\n**I love it when I am--as a player--challenged to solve a problem. I despise it when my character's challenges are abstracted to rolling dice better.**\n\nThe problems with difficulty are fundamentally a bad design problem. The player of a game has to do things--and no, I don't just mean roll dice; I mean the player has to solve in universe problems. RPGs historically use dice to draw a distinction between the player and the player character, and so habitually increase difficulty by making dice rolls harder.\n\nThat's precisely backwards. From the player point of view, all you are doing is giving the player a learned helplessness reflex because the dice are more or less completely beyond the player's control. Strong player/ PC distinctions make for poor games.\n\nD&amp;D is becoming easy because they don't know how to be hard in a good way. D&amp;D is not smart enough under the hood to be Dark Souls."", ""I think you are mixing three things that are better to consider separately: difficulty, challenge and lethality. They were treated as the same thing early in RPG history, but a lot is gained by separating them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**High difficulty** means that players can't assume they'll be successful. Whenever they enter a risky situation, defeat is a real option. That's what we see in most adventure movies - the heroes, in a typical scene, barely avoid a disaster only to get into another trouble. There's running away, getting captured, losing important items, getting surprised, having vehicles or other crucial equipment break at the most inopportune moments etc.\n\nThe important part is that for this to work, a failure must not equal death. Going from trouble into trouble works exactly because characters don't get killed or otherwise taken out from action; they get hurt and disadvantaged, but it just presents new interesting obstacles to overcome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Challenge** means that making good choices is crucial to victory. It means that there is a big difference between thinking tactically (in a broad sense of the word) and doing the first thing that comes to mind. In a challenging game, one can't behave randomly or repeat one action for the whole time and expect to win.\n\nBut this means that player choices need to matter and there must be a way to make them well. This requires that the players are given a lot of information to act upon, not forced to read GM's mind. Challenging, tactical games need strict rules that are faithfully followed, because that gives the baseline for mutual understanding and predicting the results of one's actions on the fiction. They need both intents and actions communicated clearly and acknowledged. They need difficulties and consequences of rolls stated in advance, before the rolls are made. In general, the whole resolution process, both in the mechanical and fictional part, must be clear and shared, not controlled unilaterally and kept secret by a GM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lethality** is just that - how easy it is for the characters to die. It's not inherently tied with the previous two. A game may be difficult and/or challenging without PCs ever dying. It may be lethal without a challenge, just randomly. It may even be lethal without much difficulty - when failure is very improbable, but deadly.\n\nLethality is fine in games that really embrace it - focusing on short games, clearly communicating that PCs will die, making sure that players won't be bored by having their PCs die early in the session and then doing nothing for hours. On the other hand, it's hurtful to games where it's included without much thought, often contrary to game's other themes. It's easy to see which games suffer from this when even their authors try to mitigate the deadliness somehow while still keeping it for some reason (resurrection magic, some kind of resource spent to avoid death etc.)."", ""There are a few RPGs that I play and enjoy without even a health system - difficulty in a story can be more than combat struggle.\n\nThe problem with TTRPGs with combat and diceluck is that it's possible to have the story of your character come to a sudden end just because you're unlucky. And having systems in place to avoid that happening too easily are largely considered anti-frustration features. Nothing says you need to use said features in things you run, though."", '/r/dccrpg welcomes you', ""DND 5E is a game where the GM has to play smarter not harder to challenge  the players but I find it pretty handholdy at times. I'm not trying to sound like a badass but I even found curse of Strahd easy."", ""If it's any reassurance, my players recently surprised me by asking me to up the difficulty *a lot*. We don't play D&amp;D particularly, though, but Through The Breach, and a much more investigation-focused campaign to boot. So the difficulty is more like me not giving as many off-game hints as I usually do, and not telling them if they've forgotten some important information."", ""Challenging games are definitely not mainstream, but they exist and people still enjoy them. \n\nThis dichotomy applies to all sorts of mediums, not just role-playing games. Art films are rarely loved by the masses, but everyone will line up to watch the next Marvel movie. Everquest was a difficult game, and World of Warcraft was an easy game.\n\nI don't think roleplaying and challenge are at odds at all, unless you're into story games (which aren't really role-playing games; they're storytelling games). In a game with low-challenge, low-lethality, the roleplaying and immersion will depend solely on the shared reality established in a session 0. In a game with high-challenge, high-but-fair-lethality, the roleplaying and immersion will come from realizing stupid actions will get their character killed, and they will have to treat the shared reality with respect."", ""Yes, people still enjoy being challenged.  But tabletop RPGs aren't necessarily the place they want that in.  It's easy to feel challenged while playing a video game. It's harder to feel like you are really part of an open ended story while doing so."", ""I think it's not just D&amp;D. I get not having your gaming sessions be a murder smorgasbord, but without the potential tension of losing the character then where is the thrill?\n\nThat said, I personally like creating and having tension created through other means. Don't target the character/character's HP. Hit their  best friend's tavern. Or their family's goat herd. Or the super-duper bad-ass car that they *just* finished paying off. Killing a character is a cheap &amp; easy way to generate a challenging situation, regardless of how *mechanically* easy or not it is to do such. Still, I do agree that a lot of games make it mechanically that much more difficult for PCs to die unless the GM really really goes for such. Which leads into the that sort of thing being a dick move, and round and round it goes..."", 'People still enjoy being challenged, just perhaps not in the same ways older edition fans did.']"
rpg,t3_a284yy,"Using a ""doom track"" countdown to create interesting decisionsI'm in the planning stages of a new campaign and I'm playing around with ways to introduce a sense of urgency for the players and make their decisions more impactful. I'm interested in hearing what this subreddit thinks about my solution for this, if anyone has tried something similar or if you have any suggestions for other ways to achieve similar ends.

The basic idea is borrowed by the board game Arkham Horror, which for those who have not played it is a game about trying to stop a great old one from awakening and destroying the world. During the game, a ""Doom Track"" is slowly advancing along with various random (usually bad) events being drawn from a deck of cards. If the doom track reaches a certain value before the players have won the game, the old one awakens and the players are thrown into a very difficult combat where they either win or lose the game.

The great thing about this mechanic is that it makes every decision in the game more meaningful. You can spend time gathering equipment, healing up, training skills etc., but the doom track will keep steadily advancing. If you instead pursue important game objectives you can get closer to winning the game, but if you are have not spent time preparing you risk your characters dying. Your decisions thus usually always involve interesting trade-offs and the story will always advance, no matter what happens.

So in the game I'm planning, the player characters find themselves trying to save a kingdom that is slowly turning from a Disneyesque, light-hearted world to terrifying dark-fantasy due to a mysterious corruption. It is up to the players to follow leads to figure out the cause of the corruption and travel around the kingdom to prevent the corruption taking place, or to try to clear up the fallout if it already has. I don't want the world to just lay static in wait until the players arrive, but want it to change for the worse if the players don't intervene. This is a concept similar to fronts in Dungeon World, but I want to make the progress more explicit and in a way ""take it out of my hands"". I'm the kind of DM who tends to make things a bit too easy for my players and I want this particular campaign to be high-consequence, so to explicitly put some of the bad stuff in predefined rules might make it easier for me to refrain from pulling punches, and might also make it easier for players to accept when it happens. 

I plan to make a custom deck of cards where several cards are blank, while others have described bad things happening. Perhaps a dwarven mine gets corrupted, and now a place where the players would previously have had a fairly easy time and gotten some useful equipment early on, they now have a tough adventure on their hands where the rewards will be much more hard fought. Hidden in the deck of cards will be three special bad cards that have to do with the big bad. Each of these will be put into a third of the deck that are shuffled independently (so that the third card will never be drawn until at least 2/3 into the deck). When all these three cards are drawn, the endgame begins and the players will have to hope they are well enough equipped to deal with it at this point.

Cards are drawn from the deck for two separate reasons. The first is each time a day passes in the game. This will make spending time on resting more meaningful, as players will have to weigh whether they can risk continuing at fewer resources to save time. It will also add interesting choices into how the players choose to travel in the open world. Will they prioritize getting to places that are known for fast horses? Will they start with far-off locations that are rumored to have powerful artifacts so they can get there before they are corrupted, or will they create a path to minimize the travel time between locations?

The second reason for drawing a card is something I'm a bit more reluctant to implement. I'm thinking of also drawing a card every time we end a session, independently of time passed in-game. This is to encourage making the game more speedy and discourage players from spending excessive time planning. I have a player that has a tendency to drag the game out by planning every minute thing that is done, and I know that some of the other players find this tiresome (as do I to some extent). I don't want to discourage planning too much, since it is something this player enjoys, but want to incentivize this player to only plan when it is really needed, by adding real-time spent as a factor into his planning. 

Another reason to drawing a card per session is to ensure that the campaign will not take forever and will end after a certain number of sessions, no matter what. My campaigns have a tendency of taking to long and fizzling out instead of ending at a dramatic conclusion, so this would also remedy that.

I'm wondering what this subreddit thinks of this idea? Are there parts of it you like or don't like? Does this sound like something you would enjoy playing? Is it too gameist for your taste? Have you tried something similar, and if so how did it go? Clocks in Blades in the Dark is the closest I've seen to such an implementation before, and I'm curious if there are other games that have something similar. I welcome any input and suggestions.

**TL;DR:** I'm using a custom deck of cards to draw ""bad stuff"" that happens in the campaign every time a day passes in-game or a session ends. This is to make travel time and rest time have a cost in order to make these more interesting decisions, as well as to discourage excessive planning and to force the campaign to have a climactic ending rather than fizzling out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a284yy/using_a_doom_track_countdown_to_create/,"['Clocks in Blades and other PbtA games are deeply similar, and I think Fellowship specifically has something much like this.', ""It sounds like you're trying to take a thing from a board game that takes maybe two or three hours and apply it to a campaign that will last maybe fifty or a hundred hours.\n\nIn a boardgame if you start losing it can suck but you can think 'well, it'll be over soon'. If they start losing the campaign it wont be over for dozens of hours.\n\nYou might want to have several doom tracks in the campaign, so they can win and lose some. And have alternate endings, influenced by how many wins or loses they got, rather than directly determining the ending."", 'This could be fun a lot of fun.  One reason this works so well in Arkham Horror is the game has fixed plots that all look a great deal like each other.

Those folks have a broad exposure to game mechanics, and will likely have some comment on how your idea compares to what has come before.', 'The split deck shuffling reminds me of Ghost Stories a bit with the late-game cutoff.  If you\'re going this route, I\'d recommend against end-of-session as an all the time thing and just do the draws when the group rests or when they pass a certain threshold of progress.  To make things go faster, I\'d do something a little different - engage them in their own doom.  1. Blank cards are a breather and disappear either quickly or slowly based on player choice, because 2. Each draw is three cards, and the players pick by consensus which actually happens.  The others go back into the deck.  Voluntarily taking an awful effect to hang on to a blank for later is a possible play to make on the part of the players, which makes the action feel more consequential regardless of the outcome.  (Also would suggest the bad effects be kept vague enough that it doesn\'t have to read like the players are being punished for success if they get an unlucky draw.  Spending three sessions saving the town of Garbleflarb and building relations there and then drawing ""Garbleflarb has been overrun by cultists and is now a stronghold of the dark lord/Garbleflarb sinks into the earth and is lost forever/The entire population of Garbleflarb dies of a strange sickness, only to rise again as flesh-craving ghouls"" at the end of session three would be funny but also very disheartening.)', 'I really like this idea.

rpg,t3_a27pur,"Encountered my first blatantly racist player 

So, last night was the first session of a new 5E campaign. One of the younger players, who've I've met a few times playing Age of Sigmar, &amp; as a player in a session of my 5E campaign whips out a copy of MYFAROG before the session started, and then tried to explain what a great human Varg Vikernes is! I shut it down real fast, literally blown away that I was seeing a copy of this out in the wild (I've only read all the terrible things about it online), and encountering a person who is, well, deeply troubled at the least to believe reverently in white nationalism.

Rifts itself is still in its 1st edition (1990), with an ""Ultimate"" edition sourcebook released about a decade ago with ""updates"" (but they stress, still 1st edition!).

He refuses to believe his system is broken in any way.

It all converts.  Some tweaking may be needed to balance, but it will convert.\n\nIf you want to run Rifts you\'ll want to pickup the main source book.  I\'d also recommend running over to drivethrurpg.com and looking at all the rest of the world and source books that go with it if you\'ve a very specific game in mind.\n\nThe nice thing about Rifts is it\'s kinda a ""anything goes"" type of game.

There\'s one I haven\'t played in an age...lots of good memories flooding back.\n\nIt builds on 1st but ends up pretty rough around the edges...the early 1990s were FASA\'s heyday of ""Have something for every possible contingency in the books, that way there\'s no arguments over how something should work"" game design (granted, simulation-y games were a wider industry trend at the time).  Of particular personal annoyance was the labyrinthine ""default penalty"" tree (different skills have different target number penalties when you don\'t have points in them)...if you leaf through the book, you\'ll see what I mean, it takes up an entire page and looks like it could be the wiring diagram for an old Lada.\n\nThose SR books are going to be a treasure trove of \'history as it happened\' looks into the fluff...as typical to FASA products, they do a lot of talking about ""current events"" in the fluff pieces, so what\'s in the 2nd ed book will be unique to it.\n\nIf you\'d like to play, I\'d recommend either finding a bunch of old hats who still adore 2nd specifically and can file off the rough edges of the learning curve for you, hitting a convention for the demo team experience with 5th (they do a good job of keeping the optional complexities out of the session), or picking up one of 3rd or 5th as you\'ll have more luck finding a group playing those editions.\n\n3rd was the most polished (and most supported) of the FASA-era editions that used the old dice mechanics \\[ (stat ***or*** skill) + dice modifiers vs target number + TN modifiers, typically an opposed roll, whoever has more successes wins and sometimes get bonuses based on how decisively they win\\] and will have more of an ""OSR"" feel to it...more deadly, more opportunities for shenanigans (due to discretionary pools and exploding dice), more like a simulation...while 5th feels more like playing a game, being an evolution of 4th its gameplay ends up being more predictable due to fewer moving parts.  Whether that\'s a good thing is up to the individual player, I know people who swear by 3rd and hate 4th/5th, people who swear by 4th/5th and hate 3rd, and people who will play both.\n\n4th introduced a whole new core die mechanic...\\[stat\\] + \\[skill\\] + \\[modifiers\\], 5/6 good, 1 bad, need at least \\[threshold\\] successes, standardized all modifiers to be dice pool modifiers, and eliminated discretionary pools.  I\'ve played it, I enjoyed the campaign (save for the utterly broken dice pools even as a starting character), but can\'t shake the feeling that it\'s an awkward half-step; IMO they tried to change too much too fast and that introduced a whole new host of issues that made the game \'different\' more than it made it \'better\'.\n\n5th is an evolution / revision on 4th, and does a good bit to fix some of 4th\'s issues...namely that it introduces the concept of ""limits"" to the die roll mechanic, so there\'s a cap on how many successes you can keep; you might be able to roll 30 dice and get 10 successes, but if your limit\'s 4, your limit\'s 4.  The biggest headaches I have with 5th...and I say this as someone who does genuinely like it...are that the book is a bloated mess wholly unsuited to \'quick reference during play\'; not calling out important information (forcing you to go digging into the middle of a paragraph to find crucial information that may be only tangentially related to the heading, if there even is a heading), and that introducing \'limits\' without retooling the threshold math balanced around stupidly huge dice pools and stupidly huge success counts ends up breaking the balance in places.\n\nAnd don\'t get me started on ""Wireless"" from the newer / newest editions, which boils down to ""Hey, pretty please make yourself susceptible to how we reworked deckers (hackers) so they can participate in runs instead of sitting at home basement behind their computer?  Please?  We\'ll give you back something you should have but we cut out to withhold if you do (like being able to drop a magazine as a free action)...""', 'So those are both fun, rather complicated games.  Shadowrun had mechanics for *everything* in that edition, while Rifts had perhaps a simpler base mechanic, but covered an even broader scope than Shadowrun did, which is really saying something.\n\nNeither are what current game theory would call ""good"" but I think that\'s mostly because time spent learning a game is considered a drawback these days.  To be fair, they\'re not entirely polished either, and Rifts doesn\'t seem to try to be balanced.  But if, for instance, you were going to be locked up for 10 years in the pokey, you\'d have yourself two separate systems with which you could have some amazing RPG campaigns.', 'I love Rifts, and Shadowrun. Congratulations on some good finds', ""I've never played that edition of Shadowrun but I like it, I've played the shit out of it both as a GM and as a player. Probably my 2nd favorite system. I fucking hate Rifts."", ""Man, that takes me back. I had that exact same set of books - core, Shadowtech, FoF and the Grimoire. It's good stuff, but be prepared to make your own cheat sheets to streamline things.\n\nRifts, eh. Use the books for inspiration and don't touch the system, would be my advice there."", ""With Rifts you'll probably find yourself trying to bring more modern design considerations to their game system. It does work okay, generally, but it can end up more about repeatedly chiseling down MDC from an enemy."", ""I've played a lot of Shadowrun and fucking love it, especially after 3E came along and cleaned up a lot of stuff (like decking.  Jesus.).  Across the room from me is a bookshelf with nearly every 1st-3rd edition sourcebook, minus a few random adventures, Lone Star, and (of course) Universal Brotherhood.\n\nFields of Fire was a fun supplement because of the various comments on the guns and the heavy weapons available to players.  The Grimoire is pretty much mandatory if you're going to play a mage, and Shadowtech is a nice add-on, though the Cybertechnology book is a very welcome second half to that one.  Just don't let the players see the bit on cyberzombies, because you'll always get some yahoo who wants to be one."", ""I love rifts.

RIFTS has a huge variety of characters, and no attempt to balance is made: A New West dancing girl will never be as good as fighting as a Japanese Mech Pilot, although the gap can be bridged a little bit by giving the dancing girl an energy weapon WP.  \n\n\nThe reward for learning RIFTS is over 100 sourcebooks of the hypest and craziest RPG material you'll ever read. Fascists in flying gunships fighting Wizards. Feudal Japanese Samurai fighting demons alongside high tech mechs. Vampires warring for control over South America. And it's all modular, you can have a party that consists of a mech pilot, a vampire, a Samurai, and a wild-west style saloon girl if you want. "", ""The 90's called, they want their RPGs back.""]"

Simply use the troops and spells from what game you like, say for you the Warlock isn't leading troglodytes and harpies from 3 but the Dark elves from 5 just use those troops.

rpg,t3_a23o3k,"Looking for feedback on a wounds system in a Mech RPG.So I've recently started running Mech RPG one shots using The Mecha Hack, a rules lite OSR. The system has an armor point and health point system where AP is the sum of AP given by armor and additional defense such as a shield and HP where it is a base dice plus a set number (for example D10 + 4) every level. Some mech abilities use AP as a resource, such as as an action to convert 1 AP to 2 HP on a friendly mech.  


My issues with this are when a mech takes damage, it can choose to spend AP to reduce that damage. This means my players would just take HP damage until they are at 1HP and then take damage from AP as a last resort since AP has other uses. I think this goes contrary to the idea of a joint armor and health system.  


My second problem is that mech combat doesn't feel dynamic enough and there's almost no long term effects for difficult combat, a feature I quite like in other systems. As a solution to this I'm proposing a rules change.   


Half of all HP is converted to AP. When a unit takes HP damage, gets crit or at the GMs discretion, they gain a stress marker. This represents stress to the mechs internal systems such as the main computer, reactor or the central skeleton holding it all together. Once a mech has 3 stress it loses them and rolls on a permanent damage table, resulting in something such as disadvantage on a type of check, a loss of a weapon or limb ect. 1 stress can be removed each long rest. Permanent damage can be undone but it requires a replacement of the damaged part (basically a side quest or a difficult repair check done over time).   


This should make my players take AP over HP a lot more often, makes combat more of a risk, ideally making them plan out things more strategically. It shouldn't make AP abilities too over powered because AP is now worth a lot more. However, this is the first time I'm making a major change to an RPs rules system, so I'm looking for some feedback from some more experienced GMs before I implement it. Does it seem balanced? Is there a different system I could lift the rules for to apply to this system?

If you (or a machine) takes a third or more of its Hp in damage in 1 hit then it must make a Health check or suffer a ""major wound or crippling injury"".  this means that a failed health check disables something in the damaged location, perhaps a gun or sensor on a mecha, ship etc. And on a human you have a broken limb, a punctured lung or blinded eye etc..

rpg,t3_a23fil,"I'm on the verge of giving up on RPGsUPDATE: I made a open-mic RPG night style server. I've invited people from previous games, creative storytellers and weird randoms. I think I'll get around 12 people. Games 1-2 times a week, anyone can DM in any system as long as they keep it crazy and weird. People who appear often and stay sane will become a part of SOMETHING EPIC.

Thanks for the support and ideas guys!

So, first of all, I used to love RPGs. I still kind of do. DMing is the best and least stressful creative outlet for me.

That said, every single group I'm in or DMing for falls apart within a few weeks, even if everyone is visibly enjoying the game. Reasons include: 2 or more people getting part time jobs. People getting offered free courses. Family emergencies. School/colledge, especially now. Nothing than can really be done about it.

IRL groups are not really an option for me, as gaming and RPG culture in my country is pretty damn shit, especially among veterans players. Running an all newbie game is not an option, since people get discouraged easily.

I have to admit that I had to cancel a few games as a DM (some really serious issues rising up), but my players have been warned about it. Now we can't find a date when more than 3 out of 5 people can play anymore, since it's the exam season. It also so happens that doing all the organizational time management bullish is an anxiety trigger for me, so yeah... I don't feel like asking everyone 3-4 times when they are available each week.

And while playing shorter campaigns or one-shots could be an option, it honestly doesn't work for most systems. Games end up lacking and boring for the most part. No stakes, no attachment, little understanding of the world.

I think that If I don't get a decent group in the next 3 months I'm just going to quit altogether and stop trying.

EDIT: Thanks for the encouraging words and tips! Sadly, my main problem is not the frequency of play. I miss my first experiences, when I entered some longer games and managed to get to know both the people and the characters over the course of 6-8 games. I found that games get much different and much, much more engaging when party members know each other, the world is better understood and stakes are higher. One-shots and West Marches are fun, but they in no way replicate this experience.

I'm simply really tired of spending hours searching for groups or preparing for games just for everything to fall apart within a few weeks. Honestly organizing everything now makes me anxious because of previous experiences and I'm not sure if dealing with that is worth the 2% likelihood of actually finding a long-lasting campaign.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a23fil/im_on_the_verge_of_giving_up_on_rpgs/,"[""I had a similar problem with in person groups a year ago.

No RPGing is better than bad RPGing.\n\nBut if I may offer some different advice: don't give up, take a break.

I\'m at work atm so I can\'t post links but search youtube for ""matt colville west marches"" and he\'ll explain the entire concept for you and get you excited to run a west marches game.\n\nTldr version: a West Marches campaign is a campaign where players opt-in instead of opt-out out of sessions. They decide when to play, with who and how many, and what goals they\'re going to try to achieve that session. And most importantly: every session ends back in town, so every (surviving) character is available for the next session!\n\nEdit: added bonus of a west marches game is that you can have have a player group larger than normal. You can have 13 players in the same campaign. Just tell them you won\'t run sessions for more than 6 players at a time (or whatever you\'re comfortable with). This can help with having enough players. But you can also run exploration sessions for two or three characters that still feel like they\'re contributing to the overal campaign (see the video).', 'What makes veteran RPG culture in your country ""shit""? That\'s a broad statement if I\'ve seen one.', ""Why give up on something you love? Sounds like you might need to finish school first.

Then we stick to that day, and if a few people can’t make it, we don’t play that week.\n\nI’ve found this makes people more reliable. If the game can move or if there’s no fixed day, then people will fill their week with other plans, confident the game can be moved to a day that suits them. But if Wednesday is game night every week, they’ll start planning around it.\n\nThe other trick is to have 5 or 6 people in the group (including the GM). I think 3 players plus the GM is the smallest number you can realistically play with, so having a couple of extra players means that you can go ahead with the game, even if one or two players have something unavoidable that night.', ""Welcome to adulthood.

Now this is just my working theory, but so far it seems to be working for my group. \n\nYou're going to have 2 types of players: 1. People that are really interested in the game for the sake of the game and 2. People that play just to shoot the shit with their friends and use the game as an excuse to do that. The second category is how most people start. Some people move on to the first category, others stay in the 2nd. \n\nYou sound like a person that legit loves the game, I do too, but the first thing to accept is that some people you play with are just not going to LOVE the game as much as you do.\n\nSo, whats my point with all of this? Well, my friend and I were always interested in GMing games, and we have a lot of friends to do it with. Basically what it comes down to is, sometimes you have to build the perfect group. This is what we had to do, and I'll explain how we did it. \n\nFirst, what we did is we decided is the game is always on, even if you can't show up. Period. What that means is your character misses out on XP and treasure for that session. I know that for some it breaks immersion, it bugged me too at first because it doesn't make sense for a character to just disappear, but we likened it to make playing an MMO after a while. You're not going to be able to make the raid every night, but you can next week. \n\nAnother thing is that for some people, it is a lot to ask people to read up on the material. Remember, they want to hang out with friends and have a burgeoning interest the game. Reading a 300 page manual isn't fun. There are 3 solutions for this that have worked for us: 1. Have a session 0 where you give a rough overview on how to play. 2. Write a two page primer for the system that you're playing for people to refer too. 3. Start with something simple system wise, especially when you have new players. \n\nLets expand with that third point. My friend primed the pump with that one, about a year ago. He went all the way back to Mentzer's basic version of D&amp;D. Don't get much simpler than that. By the second month of regular games, something amazing happened. Basically everyone knew the rules. They knew how to make characters, they could quote from the rulebook. This was pretty amazing to me since just about every group I've played with has had someone that constantly needed clarification on rules. And this is a group that at times we can have up to 10 people at the table. \n\nAnother thing happened as well. People started showing up for the game, not just because they want to shoot the shit with friends. They became generally interested in their characters, and the world that they were in. Some started to read material on their own. About 6 months into this new group standard we set, few even started prepping their own games, and ran it for us. In short, many of them became good role players. What we have been doing lately is, we have a casual group for those that still are mostly there for social, and we also have games were only the good role-players are invited and show up. \n\nSo, my advice to you is to try to teach through example to your players. Set some ground rules, start simple and work your way onwards to something else. It worked for us, and for the first time since my nerdy high school days, we have a solid group for once ad we just started a heavily rewritten, house ruled Rifts game, and extremely crunchy system. \n\n\n\n"", 'To reduce burnout try a more rules light system which needs less work for the DM\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is my personal philosophy for groups\n\n1.

When I had a group, if some people couldn\'t show up then the DM would just give them the option of ""Do you want me to make your character an NPC that I play or do you want your character to fade into the background for this session?""

rpg,t3_a23cxo,"The Delian TombHey guys. Its funhy cause in Matt coevillee recent dungeon video he mentioned the [Delian Tomb](https://youtu.be/zTD2RZz6mlo) that was his first in his running the game videos. He mentioned that there have probably been hundreds, if not thousands of peoppe who have ran it by now. Which is ironic because I am setup to run it tonight with some new players.  

I was wondering, based upon the timing of this, how many of you guys have run it? What did you change? How did it play out for you?

Edit

I know dnd5e is much stingier on thr magic items compared to previous editions. He mentions handing out a magic sword. I am happy to hand out a potion/scroll or two. But rather than handing out a magic sword I was thinking about just making it a silvered sword. Have the engraving of the knights fighting undead/werewolves. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a23cxo/the_delian_tomb/,"['I ran it as my first ever DnD session DMing ever, about 2.5 years ago.\n\nI changed the storyline to be about hobgoblin vs goblins and a few other minor changes. It was a super helpful abd super fun way to start.', ""I've ran it a couple times - both as off-the-cuff sessions because we felt like playing D&amp;D and had nothing planned.\n\nThe tomb itself is quite good. A major problem I found though (especially among new players, which is what the dungeon is designed for) is that as Matt describes it, the entrance to the final hidden room isn't awfully well telegraphed. You kind of have to know there could be a secret there to interpret the riddle as more than just setting fluff. If you miss the riddle or fail to solve it, the session ends pretty anti-climatically.  "", 'I changed the Oath from the first room to make the secret door at the end a little more apparent. Instead of a relief carved into the wall, I turned it into a tapestry with a large section of the oath torn from the bottom, only a few words remaining in the first room, which I mention when describing the room after the fight, no perception checks required. This clues in the players that something is missing. \n\nUpon entering the final room, the players will discover the bugbear holding the human captive before the statue attempting to shove something into the captive\'s hands and pointing urgently at the statue. That something - the torn bit of tapestry - flutters to the ground as the fight starts, and when the players are successful they can question the captive, if he/she survives.\n\nThe captive always stammers about the bugbear growling at him, pointing at the statue and repeatedly handing him the torn fragment of the tapestry. This directs the party to investigate the statue and gives them a pretty decent clue to solve the riddle. \n\nMy logic is that the goblin shaman has two scrolls of Comprehend Languages and has solved the riddle (there are multiple ""used"" scrolls scattered about the room), but since he cannot speak fluent enough Common, the language the Delian Order, he cannot say the oath to reveal the secret room. That is why they needed to kidnap a human, to get them to open the door for them (Comprehend Languages lets you understand languages, but you still can\'t speak them all). \n\nWhen questioned, the captive human will merely reveal that the bugbear and goblin shaman were interested in the statue and kept trying to give him the piece of tapestry. It shouldn\'t take long for your party to investigate the statue, find the riddle, and put together the fact that they need to recite the oath to open the secret door.', ""We played a version of it to start our most recent game. I don't think most of the players knew it was that, at least at first, but even full well knowing what it was, it was a really fun time.\n\nOur DM did mix it up, changing the riddle and in particular removing the final secret door to the tomb. It became a secret alcove near the sacrificial altar instead. But he did add a couple more rooms, including a secret ambush room between the first chamber and the altar room which really added to the game.\n\nBut 5/5 would use again. It's a great one-session introduction and easy to motivate new players with."", 'I inserted into my heavily modded version of LMOP and had it be at old owl well with Hamun Cost fighting the goblins to get inside. When the players didn’t solve the riddle and left. I assumed Hamun would figure it out eventually, so he got all the loot in there and raised the knight in the tomb as his bodyguard. Players were put out when they realised they missed out on cool stuff but it proved that the world doesn’t always wait for them ', ""I have run as a test from the adventurer's guild to new members, like a entrance exam but in another plane. It was pretty fun, I DMed for 2 new players and one veteran and everyone had a blast."", 'I ran it with 2nd level PCs and I front loaded the goblins so that the challenge was supposed to be in the first chamber, however, I forgot they had a low-powered fireball item (one use) and they used it.

', ""I added it as a side-mission after chapter 1 of a loose interpretation of Hoard of the Dragon Queen that I was running. I had some travellers spot a small faction of Kobolds take over the tomb and had the party go and clear the tomb out in order to give the people of Greenest some peace of mind. \n\nI changed the layout around a little bit but the main features remained. The party avoided the scouting party, fought 2 guards at the front of the tomb who were on watch as well as two rooms full of enemies.\n\n The first had a few kobolds and winged kobolds and the latter had more winged kobolds as well as a kobold shaman that I had homebrewed (mainly casted Heat metal, Flaming sphere, Fire bolt). The party then set up the alarm spell at the entrance and took a short rest as we were out of time on that current session, starting the next session with them fighting the retourning scouting party. \n\nI had replaced the undead encounter in the crypt with a Ochre Jelly and added a very nice magic sword as a reward in that room. Unfortunately the party were super bad at figuring out the riddle and left to return another day (Which they are very close to doing as they're heading past the tomb on their way to the next plot point and I've also hinted at there being more to this tomb in a book that the party have aquired). \n\nThe one thing I wish I changed was to make the room with the shaman a little bigger/more dynamic as they were single-file enterring the room as the flaming sphere was cast. It became a little limiting. Having a silvered sword sounds like a cool idea. \n\nThe magic sword I came up with does extra radiant damage on a critical hit and will eventually be improved to critical hit on a 19 or a 20. My world will be somewhat high magic and I feel like this wouldn't be too strong for what I have planned. "", ""It's OK. I've run it before for new players and it went alright but nowadays I feel there are better options to throw at new players.

rpg,t3_a239bk,"Just finished up a campaign, and we were all happy with itI have been running a Pathfinder campaign called Mirrors: The Thousand Blades. The premise of the campaign was that my players took on the roles of samurai armed with magical swords that granted them amazing powers. Only one thousand of these blades exist, and each is sworn to protect the high king of our home brewed world. 

The name mirrors comes from the other part of the premise; that we would each play two characters. The main party were the samurai of the “present” in our campaign world, and the second party was different owners of the same words 1,500 years in the past, before the empire the party served had even come into existence.

I set up a lot of the sessions by using the “modern” setting for training or missions, and either the instructor or the swords (that can talk) would tell the samurai a story about the past masters of the Blades that we would then play through.

We had a lot of fun, despite attendance issues and a fair number of character deaths. We got to explore the past of the campaign world this group has been playing in for a few years. We got to let loose and play regular characters with additional cool powers. I had to come up with a list of 1,000 sword names. For nine too-short months we fought against all kinds of opponents from an army of magical Kobolds to a newly-resurrected dragon death god, and the players and I had planned on the campaign ending in a large battle with the PCs dying in a blaze of glory in the present and enjoying the results of total victory in the past.

I ended the campaign with a brief description of a pair of young men holding katanas in a temple, listening to an aged samurai say “And that is the legacy your Blades carry. Use them well.”

It was quite the ride. 

As always, a campaign ending is bittersweet. We already have the next campaign planned though, a Shadowrun 5E campaign that we’re all very excited for (if only because it will bring the two-player campaign up to our normal six players).

What are benefits ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a232w0/what_are_benefits_of_roll_under/,"['Another thing I like about Roll Under that no one has mentioned yet is lack of target number inflation.\n\nIn Roll Over mechanics there is a tendency to up the target number to keep things challenging, so all of a sudden picking the lock on that one house use to be a DC 10, now it is a DC 20. This often breaks my immersion. Just as mountains of hit points break my immersion.\n\nIn Roll Under systems, modifiers tend to be less extreme and there is a stronger sense of consistency. Also the target number is often the PC’s skill. They are their own limiter. I find things more transparent.\n\nAs for roll high being ingrained...it is for D&amp;D gamers, but complete newbies to gaming tend to have no pre-conceived notions and handle roll under just fine.', ""For D100 games especially it's easy to calculate your change of succeeding. Have 30 in a skill - 30 % change of succeeding. Is it a bit easier to do this thing - get +10 %. Now you're at 40% chance.\n\nThe higher your number in a skill the better you are, and modifiers hit your effective skill, and not your roll. It makes more sense to me.\n\nAnd if you're implying roll under is a new thing - I would like to point out:\n\nBasic Roleplaying (1980) (d100)\n\nCall of Cthulhu - based on BRP (1981)\n\nGURPS (1986) (3d6)\n\nWarhammer Fantasy Roleplay (1986) (d100)\n\nAll roll under"", ""It depends on the setup, but usually any given roll-under system will have picked it for one of three reasons.\n\n* It simplifies the check mechanics to a comparison of two numbers--the TN and the dice.\n\n* It's usually objectively faster and easier to use than summed dice because it has less arithmetic. Addition produces carried digits all the time, and produces a wider variety of results. Subtraction produces a tighter set of results you can more easily memorize.\n\n* Roll-under systems can make excellent use of exploding step dice. Roll-over systems using exploding step dice have to face the conundrum that--by their logic--weak dice explode more frequently than strong dice, which sends players mixed signals and waters down the effects of stepping up the die.\n\nThe last one was the key reason I opted for roll-under in my own homebrews; it uses an inverted step dice ladder to maximize the effects of exploding dice and minimize player-end math."", 'Other than everything already mentioned (straightforwardness in success chance, making stats more meaningful etc), I particularly like the variation where Stats cap the highest number for success and  Difficulty dictates the minimum. No need to change the actual numbers at all. \n\nFor instance, on a 1-20 scale game, a character with Parkour 13 trying to escape pursuers through uneven roofs (Challenging Difficulty: 6) will only make it if they roll between 7 and 13.\n\nAdd to that the now popular Advantage dice (for things like Specialties or Stunts ala Fate) and Disadvantage dice (for complications or flaws), you can inform quite a lot without much rules stretching. ', 'I love d20 rollunder. You can multiply the score by 5 in your head to get a % chance, and 5% is the smallest increment I would want to track anyway. You don\'t have to change the 3d6 stat formula, and even the noobest players never ask ""so do I add the modifier to the stat?"". It\'s just as easy to add a difficulty modifier to the stat without that confusion.', 'As noted - simple. And it makes stats meaningful. It was a common ""quick resolution"" method back in our OD&amp;D days. I use it regularly in DCC now. \n\n', 'The main benefits are (1) players know their rough target numbers before even asking the gm, (2) every stat point matters instead of modifiers, (3) very quick, (4) easy for gm to apply mods like adv/disad or -2 etc if its a hard lock, (5) can make rulings like str 14 auto opens the door, others have to roll, and (6) scope for degrees of success eg roll under half stat is a great success etc. Low Fantasy Gaming uses this method for these reasons.', 'Simplicity', 'The advantage of roll-under systems, *as long as all modifiers are applied to the target rather than to the roll*, is that probabilities are transparent. ""What number do I have to roll to succeed?"" is clear.', 'Roll Under d20 is up for debate, but Roll Under d100 is pretty much standard.', ""Roll under gives strong bounded accuracy and is therefore best for low-power games with generalist characters instead of specialists.\n\nI only like Roll under in d100 games like Warhammer, where the granularity of the numbers means something.\n\nd20 roll under can be frustrating, and you still end up with number inflation in the order of roll under half your stat, etc.\n\nI think the value of d20 systems is that they offer a large range of options in early levels. With a +1 modifier, your range is 1-21, but a couple levels down the line if you boost your stats in what you want to specialize, the stacking modifiers give you a much higher floor to your rolls. With a +9, the lowest you're rolling is a 10, so you can go into tasks with an assurance of basic competence, and no chance of failure for DC &lt;= 10. Roll under makes it harder therefore to specialize, because if the game lets you specialize too much, you break the bounded accuracy."", 'In the 40k RPGs like Rogue Trader, you need to know a margin of success, so how many full tens you beat the skill by. \n\nWhat if when you roll equal or under the margin of success is the tens die result, and you only calculate margin on a failure?', ""There's no inherent benefit."", 'Counter thought to simplicity, don’t you think it’s ingrained now that a high score is always the most desired? You want a high percentage grade, you win games with the most points, etc, \nWhen teaching people how to play rpgs in my community, roll high systems always seem more intuitive than roll indeed. ', 'The only benefit I can think of is that it justifies having character stats exist on a 1-20 scale instead of just having the modifiers exist as the scale.\n\nNever really liked the way D&amp;D handles stats, but at least it made sense when I learned the context of how OD&amp;D had roll under.', ""Generally speaking, I am not a roll under fan. However, having played a few of them, they definitely have certain advantages.\n\n- Instant Pass/Fail: If you want to have a basic yes/no metric, roll under systems work just fine.\n\n- Investigative/Rules Light: If you want a rules light system, roll unders work great. I know there ARE crunch-heavy roll under systems out there, but I have never once had one light my fire as a player. Generally speaking, if there are more than two steps to determine the success of an action, I'm out as a player.\n\nThese are really the only advantages from where I sit, unless you want to count giving your percentiles some love (since most roll under games I've seen are d100 based, though not all).""]"
rpg,t3_a22ydy,"Looking for a good super hero gameSo, I had an absolutely favorite super hero game I played back when I was a teen.  Loved the mechanics, and thought it was a great game of the time period. I have a podcast about introducing someone new to the world of comics, and we did an episode with an old friend of mine where we talked about role playing games, and played a sample game. We had a great response, and enough people asked, so we decided to do a RPG podcast. I had someone else on board and was all set to go.

Here's my mistake. I reached out to the creator of the game we played to ask permission to use the name, and since I was delighted to see they were still in business, to offer them a spot to run an ad for free.

I got a very angry letter in response, indignant that I called the mechanics of the game ""clunky"". Well, fair enough. (In fairness, if I had talked about ANY RPG of the period, I would make jokes about clunky mechanics. THACO, anyone? Name one game that WASN'T clunky back then! I also spent most of the hour describing my love of this game. Sorry I only left you a four star review! Geesh.)

So now I have a podcast all set up, with co-hosts. I've promised my listeners this project..and I have no game to play. I would be fine, legally, but I will respect the wishes of the creators that he wants nothing to do with me.

I've been out of RPGs for about three decades. What's good? I'm looking for something with good, quick mechanics. Doesn't have to be too rule heavy. Two of the players have never played role playing games before, so a system where they don't need to read the rule book is great. (As for me, I'm a systems junkie.

rpg,t3_a20liw,"First RPG with kidsSo... I've been playing DnD 5e for a few months. I've only been role playing for about a year. So I'd still say I'm new to it all. But, after listening a couple days a week to a DnD podcast that I'm part of, my daughter wants us to play. Then two of her friends decided they want to join in as well.

I've never DM'd and these kids (ages 8, 9, and 11) have never played at all.

I'd love some tips for:

\-being a first time DM

\-teaching kids how to play

\-coming up with fun stories or suggestions of story guides to use

Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a20liw/first_rpg_with_kids/,"['I made [Maze Rats](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197158/Maze-Rats?affiliate_id=379088) for people in your situation.', 'I played Dungeon World with my daughter at 8 and she loved it.\n\nIf you don’t like narrative games and prefer minis and a map, Hero Kids is great too.', 'I always recommend Savage Worlds when dealing with kids in that age range. \n\nIts simple, fast, and fun. It uses cards for initiative (with special exciting rules for jokers). The use of *bennies* to allow you to reroll.

It's a light, comedic eastern fantasy about doing good in the world. Also, it has a... sequel, of sorts, in [Fate of the Flying Temple](https://www.evilhat.com/home/do-fate-of-the-flying-temple/), which shares a setting, but uses Fate Accelerated to turn it into a true RPG, making it a good stepping-stone if you want to go that direction.\n\n[Stuffed Fables](https://www.plaidhatgames.com/games/stuffed-fables) is a guided, GMless, choice-driven narrative board game. Remember those Choose Your Own Adventure books from when you were a kid? Stuffed Fables feels a lot like one of those, but multiplayer. It's a bit darker in tone than Do, feeling something like a Grimm's Fairy Tales version of Toy Story, and has multiple story paths to play through, lending it decent replayability.\n\nEither I feel would be a great choice for getting kids in the 8-10 range into roleplaying."", 'Seconding Savage Worlds if you have concerns about the complexity of D&amp;D, though a lot of us older folks played D&amp;D at that age because it was basically what there was to play. ', 'I was listening to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHopmeBPWyY) in the car a few weeks ago, and I think there was some valuable advice you could use there. The gist is this mother has been playing with her own kids since they were very young, and has used that experience to develop her own adventures for children to play both 5e and Pathfinder, as well as methods for dealing with the unique challenges that come with very young players.\n\nOne thing she stressed immediately was ""brain breaks"". Really little kids struggle to focus on anything for an extended period of time. Regular short breaks allows them to be kids, and helps them focus when you get back to the game. Having safe toys available that allow for some physicality helps to burn off built up energy. Foam noodles as swords I think was mentioned. Along with that, plan for shorter sessions. Aim for kid\'s movie length adventures initially, and see how they handle it if you add another thirty minutes.\n\nAnother piece of advice I thought sounded useful, was encouraging fair play by enforcing a system for taking turns to speak. Some children are going to be more socially active, and more excited to engage during roleplay scenes. They may look to their quieter peers struggling for things to say during such scenes as an opportunity to ""help"" by talking over them, or hogging the spotlight. Or, maybe they just want to be the main character in the story.\n\nEither way, nip that right in the bud by giving them an object, say a ""wand of speaking"", so they know that when they have that object, they are the ones that get to control the narrative. Set time limits on how long they have it, and don\'t make them wait too long for it, so that everyone gets a chance to speak to the NPCs. Strive not to leave anyone out, or you risk even the most engaged losing interest.\n\nThat\'s all I can really remember, but I know they talked more about the subject. Anyway, I envy you! Running your game sounds like a fun challenge! Good luck!', 'Keep the adventures short and simple--kids that age don\'t have the attention span for a long investigative campaign. You\'re pretty safe with the ""village with a wizards tower/orc cave/whatever"" nearby, at least to start.\n\nAnd yes, you should be running Call of Cthulhu for them because it\'s MY favorite system... No. Ignore the people telling you to use another system. The whole reason you\'re doing this is your daughter got interested from a D&amp;D podcast, so they want the real thing.', 'Taught my son at age 9. He loved it. It’s math. It’s also exciting to explore and find things to hunt and get treasure. \n\nYou will do fine. Just go through character creation in a simple way. I wouldn’t expect them to get too heavily into deep, meaningful roleplaying and background stuff right off the bat. Maybe ease them into the mechanics first, then add in more complex narrative layers as you go. Have them get used to their characters and what they can do. \n\nMine did well when I told him to think his process out loud. \n\nMe: you’re in a tavern and this stranger keeps looking at you.\nSon: okay I’m not sure who this is and it’s making me nervous. I don’t know whether or not to trust him. I decide to watch him a little bit.\n\nHe was very good at that part. \n\nThe only snafu we had (which is minor) is understanding what you have control over. New players (kids and adults) often think they can control a whole scene. For example, “I walk up to the stranger and he sees me and he is worried...”\n\nNope. You don’t get to control the stranger. You only get to control you. I play all of the other parts. \n\nOnce I explained that, he got it okay. \n\nThey pick up on a lot. Sounds like a great gaming session to me! Good luck!', 'I saved a great breakdown on my home computer, I\'ll try to remember the gist of it:\n\n1. Have each kid draw a picture of their character. This helps a great deal with them getting into character and visualizing things.\n\n2. On the ""character sheet"" list two or three things the character is really good or really not good at. You\'re basically asking the kids to come up with their powers and weaknesses, and encourage those to reflect on the picture (if they have wings, then they should be able to fly!).\n\n3. Only use a d10 as the dice. Using a base 10 counting system makes the most sense for kids learning basic math, after all.\n\n4. Anything difficult they have to do, roll the d10 and try to beat 5. If their power or weakness comes into play, give them an appropriate +/- 2; again, teaching basic math.\n\n5. Take a hint from kid\'s TV shows--combat isn\'t the only option, getting knocked out isn\'t the only consequence.\n\nAll that might be a bit too little for an 11 year-old, but I\'ll try to find the picture proper regardless.', 'Use some sort of magical transportation, like a flying ship or castle to cut down on the boring travel between cool adventures.', ""So many great experiences shared here.  Thank you everyone!  \n\nI actually sat down with my daughter and we created her character the other day before I posted this.  We did the full deal.  She went with a half-Elf and even dived right into picking a specific family for her character.  We are going to our friends house today to help them create their characters.  I'll look over the story suggestions everyone posted and hopefully we will be up and running a few one-offs soon to see how well they like it.  If all goes well I'll set up a campaign for them."", ""\\-Since you are playing with kids you only need a lose idea of the rules and always allow fun to triumph rules.\n\n\\-With these ages find out what interests them (this should not be hard) and make a campaign based around something akin to these generas. For example, one is a girl who likes hello kitty and the others are two boys who like Pokemon. Make a campaign centered around 'knocking out' monsters (most of which are cute) and raising them to be pets and compete in a tournament. The tournament is part pet show and part arena combat.\n\n\\-As for teaching, do what you would normally do. They have been playing games all their little lives and 5e is thankfully not complicated.\n\nI would be happy to give more tips : )"", 'Your kids are old enough for DnD 5E.

rpg,t3_a1we6q,"Using Weather Narratively in D&amp;DIn tabletop RPGs, weather often gets overlooked by Game &amp; Dungeon masters, even though it can be a really powerful narrative device. When it is used, it can get over-complicated with cumbersome mechanical systems.

rpg,t3_a1um2p,"Seeking Feedback for Fathom: An Episodic Horror Game Hello everyone,  


We here on the dev team for our WIP game, Fathom, are looking for some feedback.  


Fathom is an episodic horror game, aesthetically, inspired by classic, suspenseful horror films like Alien and games like SOMA and Bioshock. Mechanically, Fathom takes inspiration from the Powered by the Apocalypse system (in terms of move sets and character advancements) and Ten Candles (for suspense and resource use). Fathom is not purely a hack of either game, but takes inspiration from them in addition to some of our more idiosyncratic mechanics, such as the ‘predator system’.  


First, we would like some feedback on the document, in order to clear up any points that may be confusing for someone looking to play the game.  


Now on to the real request. We are looking for some playtesters, so we can gather more unbiased opinions on the mechanics of the game. The main thing we would like to test here is the interaction between the survivors and the predators.  


The predator system is a system that we developed to address the problem of character death, and at the same time contribute to the growing difficulty as a campaign progresses. When a player character dies or loses their mind in the narrative, that player doesn’t just come back as a new character (that would remove the survival aspect completely), nor are they just removed from the game completely. They come back as a predator, working in opposition to the group they were once a part of.  


For anyone looking to give feedback here is a link to the most up to date version of Fathom: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ADCFovX6xOC4QInebvPImftTUNO...](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ADCFovX6xOC4QInebvPImftTUNOL9TA_/view)  


We are also looking for any input on possible campaign length mechanics, character growth, and fleshing out the appendices.  


Our Discord link: [https://discord.gg/bEhdxme](https://discord.gg/bEhdxme)

rpg,t3_a1tdnb,"What character broke the game without breaking the rules?Hi folks! I'm designing an RPG, so of course I'm thinking about ways gamers can find loopholes or otherwise ruin a game without necessarily breaking any rules. That made me curious: Can any of y'all think of a character that did this? How did they follow the letter of the law but violate its spirit?   


**NOTE: PLEASE PLEASE** do not let this degenerate into an argument over powergaming. This should be about examples, not judgments. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a1tdnb/what_character_broke_the_game_without_breaking/,"['The latest [Ken and Robin Talk About Stuff](http://www.kenandrobintalkaboutstuff.com/index.php/episode-321-red-dawn-times/) has an initial segment devoted to ""that time Ken ran Traveller for accountants.""\n\nI wouldn\'t call this breaking the spirit of the game as much as ""legit play that the GM was unequipped for,"" but basically the PCs wound up engaging in economic actions that Ken Hite (as GM) was unequipped to effectively assess and predict knock-on effects. This led to them becoming merchant princes well in advance of what Hite might have expected (\'they adjusted their bank accounts and interest much like D&amp;D wizards might adjust their spells at the end of each session\'). \n\nDesperate to focus on something that he was more familiar with, the GM tossed in a border war. Aha! Currency destabilization and disruption to their investments!\n\n...the PCs entered the arms market.\n\nIt\'s a pretty great story. Crucially here, though, I think that the actions the PCs took were *completely legit*, and within the spirit of the game - but as something that the GM was unprepared for, they had the side effect of causing the game to metastasize into something unmanageable.', 'Not so much ""game breaking"" as ""fiction breaking"" but a player in a Star Wars D20 game I was running used the crafting rules to make a sword stronger than a lightsaber.\n\nEdit: ""Stronger"" as in ""did more damage.""', 'I was playtesting a system (Beyonder) and the rules for the ""jump"" skill included rules for damage for jumping on people.  Scaled with character size.  Enter Mooby, the golden size-5 Ushen (minotaur) with no weapon skills but a maxed-out jump skill.\n\nThe jump skill was quickly changed, and Mooby never saw combat.', 'RAW vs RAI\n\nRules As Written vs Rules As Intended\n\nGenerally, players and DM/GM/STs can tell the difference between the two.\n\nIf you go to Giant in the playground, you\'ll see a lot of characters in the category of ""Theoretical Optimization"". This term means using RAW to make a character as powerful as possible, without any regard for RAI. It\'s called a ""Theoretical Optimization"" because they realize such a character wouldn\'t necessarily be fun to play in a campaign, but it\'s fun to theorycraft.\n\nThe big ones that come to mind for me (these are all D&amp;D 3.5 examples):\n\n[Pun-Pun the Destroyer](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Pun-Pun_(3.5e_Optimized_Character_Build))\n\n[Halfling Dragonpunch](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?353323-Small-shuriken-aura-of-chaos-Infinite-damage-3-5)\n\n[Peasant Rail Cannon](https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Peasant_Railgun)\n\n[The Wish and The Word](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/The_Wish_and_the_Word_(3.5e_Optimized_Character_Build))\n\nJust do your best when writing your system. With some common sense, the potential players and GMs will know what you mean.', 'I had a player recently discover an interesting rules interaction with their clairvoyant power and the Flashback rules. They can retroactively see into the future to assist someone in crises after/before it happens.', ""I consider the Sorlock to be along these lines, a mutliclassed D&amp;D Sorcerer/Warlock able to continually regenrate spells, because Sorcerers can covert spells into Sorcery Points, and Warlocks get their spells back more often.\n\nAs specific examples of a breaking moment go, I would offer an incident from a Star Wars game I played in once. We were all playing as rogues, no Force powers. We were just smugglers. Turned out towards the end that one of our part secretly WAS a force users, and suddenly was ridiculously powerful, and was tearing trees apart with his mind. There the rest of us were with our blasters, and we next to useless next to the power of this force user. It was all completely within the rules, but the game rules were unbalanced enough to make this one character over-powered in EVERYTHING. Combat powers, social manipulation, super-senses and agility, the works. So I guess the one thing I'd take from that in a designing mindset, is that characters archetypes should always be balanced somehow, even if theres a concept which you think SHOULD be stronger. it sucks for the players.\n\nI'll offer one side example, which technically was a tabletop wargame and not an RPG, but I offer it anyway. A friend of mine did a lot of prerelease beta-testingnand feedbacking for a game called Guildball. Got me into a couple of games using their beta rules too, and he was forced to report back to them when I found a very small flaw in one rule. One character - Obulus - could take control of another and make it move. So I moved the opponent with the ball off the table. And no-one knew what to do. The lesson here, is that small oversights even in the way a rule is worded can cause a lot of confusion."", 'I think most design problems are math problems in disguise.  Some examples:\n\n**When Designers Forget About Addition:** D&amp;D 3.0 has a feat called ""Weapon Focus"".  You spend a resource (you get a limited number of feats for your character) and you get a +1 to hit with the weapon of your choice.  Assuming that feat is fine, what about an identical feat called ""Master Swordsman"" that also gives a +1 but only works with swords?  One design mistake I see a lot is to take a benchmark (like Weapon Focus) and compare the new addition to it (Master Swordsman is clearly weaker) and conclude the weaker option is fine.  The reason this is a mistake is that players before Master Swordsman were limited to +1, after they can have +2, and they will.  Master Swordsman (while fictitious) would be a terrible feat and overpowered.  Remember not just ""cost per benefit"" but what is the total cap on resources that can go into this thing.  Master Swordsmen is fine on the first, but raises the second, increasing total killing power and discouraging our fighter types from taking more diverse options.  A fighter who is a bit of a con man is more interesting than a fighter who just fights, but people don\'t take Skill Focus (Bluff) if they can take ""Get Marginally Better at your Main Shtick"" instead.     \n\n\n**When Designers Forget About Multiplication:** As an example, I made a starting character in Big Eyes Small Mouth that could destroy the planet by hitting it with a cat.  In a game where characters had maybe 100 hp, he could do tens of thousands.  Why?  Multiplication.  Extra attacks gave you extra attacks, auto-fire gave you extra hits per attack, damage bonus gave you extra damage per hit, skill gave you damage per hit, etc...  Layer them all together and they don\'t add in a linear way, they multiply together until the total is huge.  Character creation priced them based on the damage they were likely to add to a single attack, but the effect wasn\'t additive, it was exponential.  The cost was A+B+C+D, the effect was A\\*B\\*C\\*D.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**When Designers Forget About Factorials:** Suppose there are ten options in your game and the PCs pick one.  You have ten cases to consider (maybe you have ten classes to balance against each other).  Suppose instead you have two choices (PCs can multiclass!), suddenly there are 45 choices to balance (10 options for your first class times 9 options for your second class divded by two since a Fighter/Rogue is the same as a Rogue/Fighter).  Doubling the customization slots gave you 4.5 times as many combinations to balance.  If you have a game like D&amp;D 3.0 with dozens of customization slots and thousands of things to slot into each slot and there are rapidly going to be more possible builds than you can possibly track.  There are, and this is not an exaggeration I am being literal here, probably more legal Pathfinder builds than there are atoms in the universe. The key insight here is that doubling the number of feats/classes/advantages/whatevers in your game doesn\'t double the conceptual space of combinations to check for breakage, it explodes it.    \nThat is where Pun Pun comes from, publish enough options and some unexpected combination of them is going to produce infinite power (or at least a lot more power than you intended).  Pun Pun is an extreme example, but more common (and therefore more serious) is that it is basically impossible to say what the stat block of a 10th level 3.x character might be.  +40 to a skill?  It\'s possible.  +0 in that skill?  Also possible.  How do you design around that?', ""D20 and White Wolf games (others too, I'm sure) have the problem of a God Stat that governs too many factors (Dex). Seen too many characters that stack it and become unhittable and guaranteed to never miss attacks."", ""One of my favourite game breaks is still from 4e d&amp;d and went by the name of Final Sonfrontation of Suck. It hinged on the namesake power final confrontation for barbarian that let you and a target exchange blows until one of you died (or I think the player chose to end it) you could make any number of attacks back and forth for only the single action cost. The problem was the target didnt have to be an enemy it could be any creature, friend or foe. The player using the power happens to be a legal target allowing then to chain blows on themself. So a player just has to get a bit of flat damage resist, use unarmed attacks on themself with a low strength and they could make infinite attacks. That in itself wasn't that useful but there's also a feat that allowed you to deal a d10 of lightning damage to a creature within 10ft of you when you score a critical hit. Suddenly you have infinite crits and as much lightning as you feel like."", 'In order to break the game without breaking rules there would have to be some kind of rule they’re exploiting that goes against the spirit of the game itself. In which case the problem is the rule itself. \n\nHard to generalize about this point. I notice that crafty players can exploit almost any rule if it’s taken too literally. Rules are there to make the gameplay easier and standardized for everyone, but I don’t believe that any rule should have absolute 100% reverence.\n\nMy favorite example is the facing rule from DnD 5e. They got rid of the concept that certain characters face different directions on the game board to prevent every encounter from going “lol I run around the monster, stand behind him, and gain advantage by flanking”. So they kind of fixed the problem you’re talking about, but now it opened a new can of worms because you can literally have 5 players surrounding an orc and he’s able to somehow dodge attacks from all directions at once.\n\nI don’t think any rule is going to perfect and not exploitable. I think it comes down more to maturity and taking things over/making logical calls as a GM. \n\nI typically have less problems in games that are meant to be interpretive like Numenera. There’s simultaneously less rules to exploit while also building an easy way to overide silly behavior.', 'Ive done this in D&amp;D 5e. Id not say its broken the game and it wasn\'t for a serious game but id say it could be used in a serious game. My DM was pretty lax about getting full plate for my paladin and i also managed to get a +1 AC helmet(which made my char even more broken but it\'d still be broken) its really simple too just a paladin with the defender feature (don\'t remember what its called but u get to choose one at level one) it gives you +1 ac so i had 18 AC from my full plate +2 for my shield and then i used divine shield which gives +2 AC so i had 22 AC really early in the game i got the full plate from killing an NPC in full plate (so it wasn\'t like the DM gave it to me. There would be consequences. Our country got invaded but thats a story for another time)  that we met on the road at like lvl 2 or 3. Which put me at an insane advantage most NPCs could only hit me on a 15 or above but it was closer to 18-19 and when i got my +1 helmet it really made me messed up broken. Then you add the fact that paladins are one of the best early and mid game classes with smite and all that. and since we rolled stats i also had 20 strength. And also i was (and am) the most experienced player which made me nearly immortal in combat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is where the story of how broken my char was end and how i dealt with it through roleplaying starts\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow before people start judging me. I was a paladin of conquest so i decided that to show my superiority id skip using shield of faith or magic at all just to  show my opponents i was better then them even when i was fighting with a handicap\n\nThis is something i recommend to people like me that love to make powerful characters but don\'t want to be a That guy. If you realise you are outshining the other players. Give them a chance to shine through roleplaying. It will make your char seem like a total badass and make you seem like a This guy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh yeah i forgot the helmet also gave me a head butt attack for 1d6 + str (5). So i had 2 attacks per round but id ""forget"" to use it a few times every now and then', ""I remember Pruitt from WebDM once discussing a Zen Archer build of his in 3.5 who had speed-enhancing boots and an amazing longbow: He'd basically snipe every enemy he could from a football field away, had enough AC and saves to dodge most things thrown his way, and could outrun almost any enemy before they got close to threatening him.\n\nI think that Jim basically gave up on any open-terrain fights after that."", 'Not a character, but GURPS has the infinite mana well: https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/rec.games.frp.gurps/9l5DqRwO5RE\n\nWhich is potentially world-breaking if it goes wrong....', ""Palladium Heroes Unlimited is notorious for having OP pcs that 'follow the rules'.  But one guy I used to game with took this to the extreme.\n\nBackground for those unfamiliar with the system:  Characters get HP and SDC.  SDC (structural damage capacity) is the amount of damage you can take before you start bleeding out (basically).  Very rarely do you take HP damage if you still have SDC.\n\nNow...in a standard game, starting characters are going to have around 50-60 SDC in a Heroes game.  Maybe you'll have one who's extra tough and has around 100.  Most attacks at this level do around 2d4 to 2d6 damage per attack so fights aren't *too* bad.\n\nOne power is extremely OP:  Alter Physical Structure: Metal.  It grants, among many other OP things, a whopping 800 SDC when active.\n\nOkay, but that's Major power and, bar a REALLY lucky dice throw on creation, they only get one and a few minor powers.\n\nI give you Minor power Extraordinary Physical Endurance (an extra 4d4x10 SDC).  Add that to the Skills each character gets, which this particular player picked Body Building (+10 SDC), Boxing (+3D6 SDC), Gymnastics (+2D6), and Wrestling (+4D6).  These, also, give a variety of bonuses to attacking, dodging, etc.\n\nFor comparison, according to the tables a nuclear multi-warhead missile does 2d4x100 damage.  That's right....it would take a minimum of two nukes to kill this LEVEL 1 character.\n\nBut wait...there's more.  They also took the minor power Superhuman Strength.  So their Strength stat, which *was* 3d6 points is now that plus 20 plus another 2d4.\n\nAdd that turning Metal increases their strength stat by yet another 20+2d4.\n\nSo take an average strength stat of around 18 (after skills and powers), which grants +3 damage.  Metal Man is going to be doing +59 points of damage when he punches something.\n\nSo here's the scenario.  The group of heroes have SDC ranging around 50.  The bad guy has maybe 100 SDC because we need a challenge.  So Alter Body Metal guy, who already has 250 SDC as a base pulls out the metal and is now a tank with 1050 SDC points to burn through.  And one punch will shave off half the bad guy's SDC.  Not only that, but the bad guy (being crafted for a level 1 encounter) likely doesn't do much more damage than the 'normal' heroes.  And as each character generally gets three to four moves per round, this will be over once Metal Man reaches his second attack.  Because thanks to all those extra physical skills, his chance to miss are slim to none.\n\nSo while staying well within the rules of the game, it certainly violates the spirit of the game.  Either the GM has to create well overpowered enemies for Metal Man to fight, or Metal Man dominates the battlefield.  Either way, the rest of the players become useless.  It becomes all about the one player (which, in my specific example, is what he wanted as he was a narcissistic asshole) and not the group as a whole.\n\nBut why not make a Magneto-type villain, you ask?  Well, other than that developing a villain to specifically fight this one player would only feed his narcissism, he had a plan for that, too:  Minor Power:  Energy Expulsion: electrical field which allows him to general an electrical energy field that expands a radius of 10 feet + 2 feet per level around him.  He then successfully argued that, as magnetism is directly linked to electricity, his field would disrupt the Magneto-type villain's attempts to subdue him with magnetism based abilities.\n\n"", ""So in Pathfinder Society game I was in (you mentioned withholding judgement so I'll not expound more on PFS), we had an alchemist. Now alchemists can do some interesting things, most of which is pretty reasonable and one such thing is condensing a spell and its effects into a syringe basically. This allows them to take spells which are restricted to only being applied to the caster, and apply them to some other character. You can imagine the usefulness of that, there are many buff and self-defense spells that can now be shared amongst the party to some extent.\n\nThere are also odd utility spells that can only be applied to the caster of said spell and on which is Skin Send. This spell causes the caster's skin to peel away from its body and become a separate entity that the caster controls. While controlling its skin, the caster's body is essentially unconscious and completely vulnerable. The ostensible use is to use one's skin as a kind of scout who can squeeze through tight spaces. \n\nWell back to our game and we were being attacked by a purple worm (think Dune if you're not familiar). Our alchemist's turn comes up and he whips out a syringe of the spell Skin Send... So a massive enemy that would have normally taken many rounds of combat to defeat was instantly flayed alive and its body destroyed before it could return to normal."", 'u/TatsumakiRonyk Got the big one (Pun Pun), but D&amp;D 3.5 was chock full of these sorts of utterly broken combos. I suggest using the wayback machine to peruse the old WotC forums (or ENworld I suppose) for many, *many* examples.\n\n4e likewise had some pretty broken things, though not to the level of 3.5: literally unkillable Avengers, Rangers who could make dozens of attacks in a single round, and so on.', ""If you're trying to create a game with enough complexity for powergaming to be a thing... chances are you're going to have a bad time. DnD is a game that's full to the brim with pages upon pages of class/race feature, feats, spells, magic items, ect. And that level of mechanical complexity is only possible because of the huge company behind it. \n\nSo unless I'm mistaken, and you do have a whole team backing you up, you're an independent developer. Meaning you just don't have the resources and manpower to create a game with that level of granularity, and go through extensive playtesting and revisions necessary to prevent it from being a broken mess.\n\nI'd recommend familiarizing yourself with simpler games before you get too attached to your baby. "", ""Wasn't my character (probably was played around the time I was born, but that's neither here nor there) but have you heard of [Old Man Henderson](https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Old_Man_Henderson) or [The Guy Who Destroyed Psionics](https://1d4chan.org/wiki/That_Guy_Destroys_Psionics)?\n\nAs far as I can tell from the stories, both characters were made within the rules but just used them in ways that lead to absurdity."", ""This thread was very helpful for me figuring out what it is I want to avoid when making my own system.

I don\'t remember the names of the powers, but Schism was one.  You split you mind into 2 different entities that could manifest powers separately.  Then each one has to manifest a sharing power that basically stated ""Whatever happens to me, happens to you.""  Then you manifest another power that gives another person a single power point and kaboom!  Infinite points.  The problem is, if you take any form of damage, it feedbacks infinitely and kills your characters.

You could do an entire 100% serious literature class on just that, but you don\'t need to, because you also have the history of gaming itself: Dungeons and Dragons alone has generated plenty of news stories in its day.  Then you have all the actual scientific study of RPGs (mostly D&amp;D): there\'s been plenty over the years.\n\nAll that can provide tons of ""serious"" subject matter.  But then you can also discuss the ""craft"" of gaming (eg. how a DM creates an adventure, how it\'s the same/different from an author writing a story, etc.) and you sort of have to play at least one game as part of that.

Incorporate storytelling elements and Joseph Campbell and all that, but not to the point that you lose your primary focus.

Then we moved on to sociological theories of escapism, use of the medium for MAUS (specifically how it was made for children), a psychological profile of  Magneto, and ended with a crash course in animation (how it was influenced by comics and the 90s Spiderman's contributions to how modern animation is created). Each topic was taken separately, and the professor showed why each were important to the medium throughout the ages. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe did far more in that class than just read comics, it spanned a large variety of subject matter and required prerequisites so that it wasn't an easily accessible class for those that didn't take the subject matter at least a little seriously. My point with all this is that the class was classified as a sociology class, and thus focused primarily on sociological impact and studies related to the subject matter. We did briefly delve into different artistic methods and theories, marketing, history and a few other topics but it was always to give background and understanding into the next sociological concept. Narrow down your topic from just RPGs to something more concrete about RPGs, or make it an introduction class and make sure that you keep it grounded in academics. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, if you were to do an introduction class I would break it down into four subjects: history of games, influences and pop culture, the business of games, and finally rules and problem solving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a resource here is a list of studies: [http://www.rpgstudies.net/](http://www.rpgstudies.net/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an aside: while this subreddit is focused on TTRPGs, remember that for large swatch of people the closest thing they have been to that is a RPG video game, which I would try and tackle as a completely different subject matter. "", 'I can\'t believe no one has mention game mechanics.\n\nDesigning functional game mechanics that convey the feeling of the setting and encourage the kind of role-play desired is very difficult, and involves lots of..\n1. Math (algebra, specifically)\n1. Statistics\n1. Probability theory\n1. Game theory (as in the psychological game theory, as often of interest in economics - prediction of human choice behavior)\n1. Economic theory\n1. Political theory (the nature of the mechanics implicitly defines the order of rule; which is often true in real politics itself)\n1. Logic and Critical Thinking (knowing critical thinking skills is a must for game mechanics design. Most of game mechanics\' history is a history of examining a critical thought. We make the mechanic to cause a person to think in certain ways, and the intention should be provocative).\n1. Bayesian theory\n\nThere is a lot to cover in mechanics design.\n\nAs for a justification, that\'s easy: to teach the academic skills required for game development within the business industry.\n\nEveryone seems to forget that game development is a job; it has a sizable industry ($9 billion global, $1.4 billion Canada/US, RPGs $100 - $200 million global), only 2 billion shy of the global Agriculture, forestry and fishing industry, and 2 billion more than the global education industry.\n\nFurther, the hobby game industry has seen a growth behavior (+20% globally, and RPGs have seen +29%) coordinating with the growing economic ""nesting"" consumer behavior (more tending to stay at home more often that going out).\n\nIt\'s a business, and it\'s a *ruthless* one filled with freelance employees, and everyone trying to figure out how to break the next trend open.\n\nThis is specifically challenging when there are no courses directly desigined to give graduates the tools required to be essential in the table top industry. It\'s mostly an industry relying on people\'s knowledge from having played games for a long time.\n\nIf there were actual courses for this training, the industry would likely see a boost in its market value and the craft taken more seriously.\n\nRemember, when Disney went into business, animation was not considered a real industry - it was for college boys to earn some cash fooling around and that was it.\n\nBut Disney turned it into a craft of the math, science, history, and psychology of the art - eventually establishing schools to teach animation specifically.\n\nRPGs aren\'t just about humanities in terms of social behavior (role playing). They, along with all table top games, are also equally a study in the mechanics of human cognitive adoptionism (accepting a set of boundaries and permissions as normal and moving their question of authority to the background; roll playing).\n\nCheers,\nTheStumpps', ""Perhaps focussing on narration by different characters?\nlet the PC's and DM narrate the story afterward in the written word.\nLet them mash these narrations together as one coherent story where certain parts are told by different perspectives.\n\nCool that you are making the effort on making a cool course!"", 'I took a Coursera course using Lord of the Rings Online MMO as a main teaching mechanism for remediation of storytelling into games.

Some sources would be: The Living Handbook of Narratology (http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/) and on the complexity side a writer like Victoria N Alexander might be applicable.', ""Check out [this](http://legendaryquest.netfirms.com/books/RPG_Design_Patterns_9_13_09.pdf). It's the only one of it's kind that I have found, and it takes the rigorous approach of considering RPG's.\n\nWhat I like about that approach is it tries to be objective in how it looks at games, while also getting somewhere. There are so many different terms used for things like skills, ability scores, traits, etc. and that approach essentially looks at them as all the same thing, gauges (well, it looks at a small number of generalized mechanics), and then analyzes how each one is different. Then it analyzes different patterns of how those games apply that, and suddenly the vast array of possible RPG's start to look like the same game with very slight tweaks on the formula. What's most interesting about that, is it reveals a vast array of possible but non-existing RPG's that could exist based on established subsystems. It also leaves open a framework to potentially come up with new kinds of gauges that explode the possibility space of how you can develop RPG's in ways never even considered before.""]"

There is a certain play style that is part of the OSR, and there are games (mostly of a certain era) that are considered OSR games - along with many of the various clones and derivatives of them - and these games are not necessarily all D&amp;D-derivatives (although many of them are).  \n\nYou can play (many) modern games in the style of old-school play, and you can play old (and retrocloned) games in a non-old-school manner.\nIn a way, OSR has a fuzzy definition along the lines of “I know it when I see it.”', 'To me, OSR is best described as running games with a certain mindset. Instead of providing a definition that would necessarily be imperfect, I can point you towards two sources that describe this mindset: [Principia Apocrypha](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html) and the [OSR Primer](http://www.lulu.com/shop/matthew-finch/quick-primer-for-old-school-gaming/ebook/product-3159558.html)', 'My personal take on it.\n\n1) Game is simple to run, simple to teach, simple to homebrew.\n\n2) The mindset is primarily ""there\'s no need to have rules for things you can just do"" - So you don\'t need rules for perception, because your characters have eyes. They can just look at the thing. You don\'t need narrative prescriptions of what happens next, because life doesn\'t have a plot and sometimes stuff just happens.\n\n3) The rules exist to let the DM adjudicate and create on the fly, without having to pause the game (ie, create a ruling)\n\n4) Emergent narrative &gt; prescripted narrative\n\n5) Player skill &gt; character skill\n\n6) Just roll with it, man, see what happens.\n\nEdit: 7) OSR is what you make of it, there is no true path but the one you make', ""I think it's more of a spectrum or sliding scale than a yes-or-no answer. There are a bunch of elements to it, and the more you have the more consensus you will get that a thing is OSR.

Retroclones all fit a majority, some less D&amp;D-like games still manage to be indisputably OSR (Into the Odd, Stars Without Number, Godbound, Maze Rats, Knave) because they hit most of the criteria, a few other old-school games that aren't even d20 fit the list better than WotC D&amp;D editions do (Call of Cthulhu gets 7/12, Classic Traveller gets 8/12, no WotC edition hits more than 3/12.)"", ""I'm just going to sneak in here - because I have only started seeing the term OSR recently and I have no idea what it means."", 'The four basic guidelines of OSR (according to one source) are:\n\nRulings &gt; Rules\nBalace is ignored\nNarrative positioning is key\nPlayer skills &gt; character skills\n\nFor example, OSR folks would generally be /very/ against the whole ""rolling perception without any description"" thing, because it violates the last two rules. They would instead have you describe what you are looking for and how your character goes about it, maybe improvising a difficulty roll if it\'s necessary for whatever reason.\n\nIn general, i would say that OSR is a style where survival isn\'t assumed, so the players have to be free to cleverly use resources, the environment, and whatever else they can to get an advantage. If you engage in a fair fight, you\'ve already lost.', 'Different people have very different definitions. For a lot its a similar ruleset. IfI  buy an adventure written for LotFP I can run it using the Black Hack or B/X. For some people its a style of play, not a rules system.

I would still consider that OSR but some people wouldnt. Mothership is a scifi system that feels like an osr game but doesnt look like a classic tsr game. Same type of thing. I tend to be pretty permissive on my definition but depends who you ask', 'I like to think of the OSR as more akin to a school of art, such as impressionism or futurism, with a set of aesthetic and design priorities.

(The final two could probably be abstracted into outcomes being contingent on actions, or consequentiality.)

If magic is so common in your setting that the smallfolk aren't impressed by it, the real entertainment should come from duplicating magical effects without spells, doing things that spells can't do, or using magic in funny or inventive ways.\n\nAlso keep in mind that showmanship matters. There is a difference beteen your uncle pulling a coin out of your ear and making an elephant appear behind a curtain."", 'In most of these settings, magic requires some sort of obvious casting, so sleight of hand may still be impressive.\n', ""If something like small scale kinetic effects are commonly known, then most magicians' tricks that are impressive to us become trivial.\n\nFind out what the people think is impossible to achieve with commonly available means, and pretend that. But that's going to be hard if illusions are expected, because you can make an illusion of anything."", 'Alternately, you could take the Terry Pratchett route, and have street magicians be more impressive to normal folks than wizards due to ""performance"" magic being seen as requiring more skill and practice than stuff done with ""boring old"" magic.', 'The appeal of stage magic, in my opinion, is that you see prosaic objects presented in an exotic context. We all understand how a deck of cards works. Seeing a magician deal a deck of cards onto the table, but all the cards vanish and there\'s nothing in the deck at the end- that\'s surprising because of the context switch. We all have a vague sense of how it\'s done- we *know* there\'s a trick to it, even if we\'re a bit fuzzy on what the trick actually might be.\n\nNow, this is a very modern approach to magic. Even into the 20th Century, mainstream magicians *did* often claim supernatural abilities (and to this day, hoaxers continue to do so). As you rewind the clock, magic-as-legitimate-performance-for-entertainment starts to give way to magic-as-con-game. ""Look, I\'m protected by the gods, so I can walk across these coals. Now give me money, and I\'ll tell the gods what a great person you are.""\n\nSo, the core of magic is presenting the mundane in a seemingly impossible context, and its purpose can be to *entertain* or to *trick*.\n\nSo, let\'s say there\'s real magic. *Both of these motivations still work*. The question becomes: how educated is the general populace about magic? Is there a wizard on every corner? Are hedge witches doing charms for good harvests? Or is there like one Wizard College, and everybody\'s a little put off by them because they have a tendency to make things explode?\n\nWhat this really impacts is the *kinds* of tricks that are going to impress, because again, the fundamental core of magic is *the prosaic made exotic*. If fireballs are prosaic, then no stage magician is going to conjure a fireball- unless they\'re going to use that to do something a fireball can\'t do (imagine freezing a glass of water with a fireball!). If fireballs are exotic, but known to the public, the magician might be more cautious about incorporating them- there\'s too much of a risk of leaving the audience non-plussed, unless they can come up with a way of turning the prosaic (say, that glass of water again) into the exotic (the fireball explodes out of a glass of water).\n\nTL;DR: what\'s mundane for this world? a magician will present the mundane things in an exotic context to make them appear magical, either to entertain or to mystify and con.', 'Two things you might want to think about:\n\nArthur C Clark said ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"" so in terms of your game a ""street magician"" could just be someone with advanced technology. A bic lighter would be impressive to people that normally toil to make fire. Hell a foam pillow or plastic container that kept food fresh would be impressive to standard fantasy people. The Wizard in The Wizard of Oz was a scientist and everyone called him a wizard because they couldn\'t fully understand the technology he had. There is also use of science as magic in the Shannara books and it\'s described by one of the users as a form of ""magic"" left over by the ancient lost world of our civilization.\n\nAnother thing to remember is if an entire world has magic there are expectations on how magic should work. Someone performing a task that is not normally possible with conventional magic, making a card appear and reappear rapidly for example, so when the people see it they\'d likely be impressed with this brand new form of mysterious magic that does not seem to meet to normal expectations.

There\'s those Now You See Me movies (not great movies, but they get that sense of""How did they do that?"" for the most part), there\'s The Prestige, and its rip-off The Illusionist. And, of course, those magicians reality shows.\n\nMost fantasy games have Illusion magic and prestidigitation, but a lot of other spells can be flavoured to look more grounded, If you are invested to look at them one by one.

The default setting is sparse, intended to be filled in by the GM (it can be ignored entirely), so a more grimdark outlook can be emphasized if that\'s what you want.\n\n* *Not like D&amp;D with levels:* Unfortunately, SWN fails on this point. It\'s clearly in the vein of OSR-style games, so it has a D&amp;D-esque heritage, including character levels. That being said, it\'s also not exactly scaled like most systems related to D&amp;D, so a 10th level character in SWN is a *very* experienced, high-level character.\n\n* *[It shouldn\'t feature] fighting gigantic behemoths with magical swords and shrugging off getting hit by attacks that would disintegrate a normal human:* SWN scores on this point. Combat should generally be avoided whenever possible in SWN due to the lethality. There are high-powered weapons and armor available since future tech is part of the setting, but even so, it\'s not outside of the genre.\n\nSWN isn\'t a perfect fit for your requirements, but it\'s good enough of a system (and free), that I think it\'s worth a look.\n\nOther things you might be interested to know about SWN:\n\n* Dual-legacy: Stars Without Number is a sort of spiritual successor to classic Traveller as well as (old school) D&amp;D. It\'s not quite either thing, but you can see the design influences of both.\n\n* By default, SWN uses a hex-crawl approach to space travel. This means that it includes a lot of tools to inspire the GM to develop a large number of worlds and sector groups to act as a customized setting instead of detailing a fixed setting for all games.\n\n* The tools that SWN offers for planet, sector, and group creation, along with the concept of the faction turn are worth porting into other science fiction games, and they\'re meant to be portable since they\'re not very dependent on external mechanics.\n\n* Psychic powers are a core conceit within SWN. A GM could leave them out if they wanted to, but the rules assume the existence of those powers. There\'s a completely optional system called space magic which strays closer to D&amp;D concepts if a GM wanted a more fantastic system, but it\'s only mentioned in an optional chapter (which might only be in the fully paid version) and an upcoming sourcebook.\n\n* For the most part, the revised edition is compatible with all of the first edition books. (Conversion notes are included.) The biggest differences between revised and first edition is the skill list and how armor class is handled.\n\n* SWN has a sister game called Other Dust which is set on a post-apocalyptic Earth. It is a bit more grimdark than the default SWN. There is a free adventure for Other Dust called Grandfather\'s Rain.', 'Designed for Traveller, but easily convert to anything else: https://www.freelancetraveller.com/features/advents/index.html', ""I have made my own 5e sci-fi module, and have received a generally positive response.

rpg,t3_a1q7bo,"Question about firearms in Seventh Sea.Hello all,

My group recently decided to try a different game for a bit. Some of us want to try Seventh Sea, but there are still some doubts. One of them has to do with firearms. 

Whenever a Villian uses a firearm, they automatically inflict one Dramatic Wound that cannot be avoided or negated. How scary is this in practice? How often did firearms appear in your game? How painful was such an attack?

I'm having some difficulty getting a sense of the context, since I'm not sure how devastating a Dramatic Wound is. Is this something one might want to houserule? Or is the Dramatic Wound less impactful than I'm currently guessing it is?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a1q7bo/question_about_firearms_in_seventh_sea/,"[""As I understand it (playing a campaign that has had a lot of homebrew changes to the system as we play), firearms are supposed to be extremely dangerous and scary, but they also take a ridiculous amount of time to reload, making them less effective than using dueling techniques with every raise. Also, you don't mark the normal wounds leading up to that dramatic wound, so unless you keep using firearms it doesn't help you fill their wound track faster. In fact, the first dramatic wound is helpful for the hero as it gives a bonus.\n\nFor example, let's say you could only take two dramatic wounds, so your track has 10 wounds:\n\nooooOooooO\n\nYou get shot and take one dramatic wound:\n\nooooXooooO\n\nIt will now take 9 small wounds, rather than 10, to make you helpless. If the villain spends 5 raises to reload then fires again, that will make you helpless, but they'll have spent 7 raises doing the equivalent of 10 damage.\n\nNow, what's to stop you from carrying several pistols to avoid the long reload times? Nothing in the book, unfortunately. So just, I guess, pretend that's not an option."", 'Firearms are scary. I play, and have been shot, and have lived. ', '7th Sea 2e is a great setting wedded to a storygame system that I, a devout lover of storygames, admire but cannot get behind.\n\nAnd THIS bit about firearms is your one reservation?\n\nHow did this come to be your primary concern?', ""In Seventh Sea, firearms are particularly deadly.  You only have 4 Dramatic Wounds, and a firearm from a Villain (note that Brute Squads don't have this rule, so feel free to throw as many mook riflemen at your players as you want) is going to take one away instantly.  Atop of all that, when said Villain uses their extra Raises from their Aim roll to damage a player, they start counting Wounds from the last Dramatic Wound they just took (i.e. the one caused by the firearm.)  In setting, the power of firearms has rendered the use of armor to be a moot point in battle.  Royal guards may wear ceremonial armor, but that's about it.\n\nAs for how common they are, it entirely depends on who the Villain(s) is/are.  But, the Montaigne military is able to field plenty of muskets (which are sometimes picked up by thieves, brigands, and scavengers,) and it's pretty rare to see a noble without a pistol or two since they can afford them easily.  It wouldn't be unreal for each your players to have one each too, based on what backgrounds they take.\n\nAs is, the rules for firearms is fine.  It takes 5 Raises to reload a firearm, which means it's going to take most, if not all of a character's turn to reload.  As a result, most people who want to get more than one shot off in a battle tend to carry more than one (since swapping weapons only takes 1 Raise instead of 5.)  And there's a tradeoff for taking Dramatic Wounds.  The first and third ones provide a bonus to the characters while the second and fourth are effectively penalties.  It should also be noted that gaining your last Dramatic Wound isn't instant death, it's just a KO.  A Villain has to spend resources (i.e. a Raise and a Villain Point) to actually kill a character off.  So savvy and quick players will be able to get their unconscious buddies off the battlefield before such a thing can occur."", 'Probably a better question for /r/7thsea than for here.

We were not the guys that never got invited places, and if we did end up at parties it was because we crashed them.

rpg,t3_a1o0vw,"I've decided to restart my campaign about an hour before our next session.So our session starts pretty soon - Everyone starts showing up at the top of the hour, play begins a half hour after that or when everyone gets together and settled down. Not long ago I realized something pretty crucial about the state of the game and think I've figured out how to fix it. Tonight, instead of fighting off a hoard of monsters in the middle of the night and exploring some more, the party will be given a choice.

1. Keep going with this dead end campaign which is likely to lose everyone's interest.
2. Start a new campaign - same setting, same characters, same inventories, different location, real story.
3. Scrap game all together.

Why am I doing this? Our game didn't start off right. I had a group of people basically say ""Hey, we want you to GM for us!"" I was down, as I was already GMing a huge homebrew universe. I just threw them in the universe I already had as opposed to making a whole new one.

The problem was our numerous Session 0's. I've had two waves of players who started at different times and missed a lot all together. Our first wave was a couple people who made decent characters and got a simple mission. I wasn't sure how long the party would last, as this group had been pretty spotty in the past, so I didn't make any grand plans. The second wave got invited after half that first wave dropped. I gave them a separate session 0 outside of the game and threw them in pretty awkwardly.

Half the new wave dropped, the remaining half of the old wave missed a couple weeks since an old friend of theirs came back to town, and it was a train wreck overall. I said 'screw it, we're throwing you elsewhere for a new plot' since getting everyone back together would be a hassle. Queue the God of Chaos pulling them together and throwing them on a planet together with little instruction. Again, expected the campaign to die pretty quick, so was just going to do it for fun.

Well, since then the remaining party has shown themselves to be really interested in the game. They want to learn more about the world and whatnot, which sucks because I've put them in a really restricting setting. My thinking was 'they'll never last long enough to get off the planet'. Now that they want to and there's no feasible way to do so in a reasonable time frame, I'm calling this campaign a bust and hoping to move on.

What caused this? Well besides a lack of faith in my party, there was a lack of planning. Session 0 was so spotty, our first session as a party was 'Session 1', so we missed a lot of basic stuff. Additionally, I considered this campaign a 'side campaign' for a long time, meaning I didn't put any planning into it and basically used it to practice my improv skills.

After being thrown on the planet by the God of Chaos, they found a map of the planet and a short description that went something like 'this planets totalitarian government is at war with a group of rebels. Travel is highly regulated and very few people outside the planet know what's really going on.' The God then informed them that if they wanted to get off the planet, they'd have to follow the footsteps of the last group of people he put here. After that I BS'd a bunch of stuff and the game became convoluted pretty quick.

There's never been consistent plot, location, or quests so far. The most straightforward quest they've gotten so far is 'I'll pay you for every native inhabitants head you bring me'. Other quests were improved on the spot i.e. 'pissed off elemental with a foreign gem shoved in it is apparently a regional problem', 'I need to meet with the mayors of the districts but they refuse to get together', and 'your current equipment sucks, you'd better get money to buy some new stuff'. I had a basic plot for the rest of the campaign too, but could never steer the party that way.

So yeah, this game is a bust and I'm going to let the party know what's going on and where to go from here. Here's hoping another scene shift isn't going to be a problem for everyone! Wish me luck guys!

POST SESSION EDIT

We decided to just cycle forward in time. Get the party settled and whatnot, get their current host of meaningless quests wrapped up, etc.

rpg,t3_a1nqkq,"Am I being unreasonably upset that some of my players are not giving me feedback?A.k.a Players, send words of your appreciation to your DM!Throwaway account since my players know my reddit name.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started a new campaign with couple of online strangers and it's fun! However, as you all know, DMing can take a long time, especially if the DM is really invested in the world he created. So I asked my players, at the end of each session, to give me feedback as an opportunity to improve myself and, perhaps, as a way to get some words of appreciation for my hard work. However, majority of my players keep ""forgetting"" to give me feedback. One guy even said that he doesn't have the time. Literally, giving feedback takes less than 5 minutes; just state what is on your mind!

&amp;#x200B;

The few who do I really appreciate. I kept rereading the part where they said they really enjoyed the session and that I was doing a great job. These small things keep me excited about the game! So I do appreciate the few but, for others, it feels like I'm just a free entertainment for them. I work hard to create this amazing world for everybody to enjoy hours at a time but can't even take couple minutes to give me feedback? One guy even gave me a one liner as a ""feedback"" because I believe I was so insistent.

&amp;#x200B;

So players, please listen to your DM/show some appreciation. Most of them work hard for your enjoyment and they will feel appreciated with just couple words of ""good job"" and genuine feedback.

So I figured I must do something right.\n\nI thought about giving my players a questionnaire after the current adventure where they can give feedback but I fear that it may feel to unpersonal.\n\nOne thing I noticed how my players liked something is when they mention and reminisce about events of the game outside the game. Like: ""Hey do you remember when we did that cool thing 2 years ago?""', 'In my experience, if you are not meeting expectations, you will hear about it. On the flip side, if your players keep coming back with enthusiasm, then you are doing it right.\n\nPersonally, a full table on game night is all the feedback I need.', ""My motto is let people play the way they want to play.  Some people love giving feedback and most just enjoy playing.  It is more a personality issue than a love for the game issue.\n\nIt is very much like the Internet in general.  90% of the content comes from 10% of the people.  So if you have five players, there is a 5% chance that one of them might give you feedback.  If one does, great.  If two do, consider yourself lucky.\n\nThe primary feedback you will get from your game is attendance.  If players are coming to the game, the love it or at least have no better game available.  If you get new players and they don't come back, then you should consider that as negative feedback.\n\n"", ""I understand you wanting feedback and that's a good thing, but some people won't know what to say if the request is too general. I also don't think it's unreasonable for someone to be too busy to write feedback after the fact or to only write a one liner, feedback is feedback. It's not great to be fussy about how long it is, especially if you basically kept asking them until the person did it to get you off their back. \n\nI always make a point of saying 'thank you for the session/I really enjoyed that' to the DM after each session (because it's true and I appreciate their efforts) but I certainly wouldn't be able to write feedback every week unless there was a really specific thing they wanted to check in about. And I can't imagine something needing to be checked every single week.\n\nAre you perhaps conflating getting feedback with appreciation of your time? Does everyone just leave and not say thanks for the session when you're done? If the latter is true I'm sorry to hear that, it IS a quite rude and unappreciative - but if you're trying to offset that with weekly feedback that might be part of the problem. \n\nHow much is really changing week to week that someone has something fresh to say? I don't even ask my boss for feedback every week on my job - because some weeks there wouldn't be anything to discuss and it'd be a waste of time to make stuff up.\n\nI hope you find the balance between feeling appreciated and playing and I hope that your players ARE saying thanks but you might get more meaningful feedback (if you are actually after feedback and not just generic praise) if you ask less often and about specific things.\n"", ""I've come to adopt the mindset that if they don't say anything, they absolutely loved it. "", 'Use Google Forms to make a survey, and send it to the players. I get a nearly 100% response rate when I do that. \n\nAsk specific questions on the survey. Don\'t ask something like ""Did you like the game and why?"", instead ask ""On a scale of 1 to 5, there was enough combat in this session"" or ""On a scale of 1 to 5, there was enough for my character to do"". \n\nI\'ll normally do a survey after the first session or two to make sure a campaign is on track, then every couple of months after that.', ""So here's a thing: if the players are having fun, you're doing your job, and you're doing it well. If they're not having fun, there's a problem, and you've got to figure out what that problem is. The thing is, if the players are having fun, they're not gonna have much feedback that's useful to you, and they're not going to have fun when you try to get some extra feedback out of them. The easy solution is to just ask if they had fun. If they had fun, you got all the useful feedback you're likely to get. If they didn't, just ask them what the problem was. "", 'Is it an online thing that people leave feedback? Like Yelp reviews? Like if you get less feedback your score as a GM takes a hit? Genuinely asking b cause I can’t think of a good reason why someone needs constant reviews?\n\nMakes me want to game online even less. If I keep coming back, it’s fun. If it’s not working, I will communicate that. \n\n']"
rpg,t3_a1nouj,"How accessible is Warhammer Fantasy?10-15 years ago I used to play games like Paladium, Nightbane, and rifts, then took a break from RPGs until a few years ago when I got into DND fifth edition.  Basically I’m no stranger to RPGs.

I’ve always had some fascination with Warhammer but have only experienced the world through video games.

So I want to ask the community, how accessible is Warhammer Fantasy?  What core books would you say are needed, and if I picked them up, how easy would be the transition from a 5E group to Warhammer?  Are miniatures required to play?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a1nouj/how_accessible_is_warhammer_fantasy/,"['I can only speak to WFRP2e which is still my favorite edition (have only played 1 wfrp4e game but it turns up the crunch quite a bit).  I would recommend the Corebook and Plundered Vaults which is a collection of short adventures to get you started.  You\'ll know if you\'ll like this game or not after running through those adventures.  \n\nThe transition will be jarring from 5e to WFRP because you are not naturally heroic in WFRP (2e or 4e).  It\'s one of those games where you can be brought down by one shot at any time.  There are Fate Points that serve as ""extra lives"" so it\'s not insta-gib.  But it\'s also a game where the same can be said about most of your foes.  Because of this, combat is a very serious affair that is typically infrequent and often avoided unless deemed necessary.  Games tend to be more about social and investigative interactions.\n\nThe default career system is also very jarring to DnD5e players because it assumes you will randomly generate your character completely as oppose to choose.  But unlike DnD5e imbalance is the name of the game and there\'s not really a power gap in a way that you can have them in DnD games.  However nothing stops you from just overriding this assumption and choosing.\n\nSystem opreates on a simple d100 (either edition).  2e is slightly more crunchy than DnD5e, 4e is a lot more crunchy.  Assuming you want to play with the full rules, both editions inform you that you can simplify the mechanics if you so wish.  Miniatures not required but there\'s a typical mini system present if you want to use mini\'s.\n\nDescribing WFRP with other games - Call of Cthulhu Horror, Exploration and Investigation spliced with the fantasy trappings of DnD.', 'What about V5?', ""This rather depends which version you are interested in as they vary a lot.\n\nv1 is quite difficult to collect.  The Core Rulebook is still available but a lot of the official supplements are out of print, and unless it has been digitised then you haven't got much hope of collecting the fan-made supplements which were probably the best material produced.  Likewise, Warpstone Magazine which published huge amounts of additional material has ceased publication and some of the early copies are now worth a fortune to collectors.\n\nv2 which was the reprint sponsored directly by GW, when it suddenly thought it was missing out on some cash is much easier to get hold of.  In fact, I managed to acquire most of the books as free .pdf downloads.\n\nv3 was the second attempt by GW to make money out of WFRP and is more like a boxed set with special dice and cards.  I've never played it but from wtahcing the videos it looks similar to a tabletop boardgame and so you really need to find an official box to play. \n\nV4 I really know little about except by reputation.  but basically I've heard its extremely high fantasy and only pays lip service the the original game.

**[possible spoilers ahead, I guess?]**


My idea is to set it in the main HP timeline, during Year 7 when the main trio are roaming round the country, but set it in Hogwarts after Voldemort and the Death Eaters have taken over and Snape is headmaster. Basically we want to play out the year where Neville, Luna, and the others are quietly rebuilding Dumbledore's Army and waiting for the moment to go ""Wolverines!""

So I need a little bit of help brainstorming some possible key scenes of drama; stopping the Death Eater teachers tormenting students, sabotaging their plans, etc. Obviously we won't have time to play out every day of that awful year, just thinking what the key points to be.

Alternatively if anyone has some links to some good fan-theories/fanfic for that period, I'd appreciate that too!

Going to be using FAE, if that matters.

They might hurt you, they might hurt you terribly, they might even steal your soul, because they’re just that broken. But it won’t be why they’re there.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They’ll be there because if they were not there, you would suffer and die, alone, and with no witnesses; and for someone to die in such a fashion is anathema to Hell.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They will come and visit you, now and then, if you live in the mountains, isolated, with no one else to know.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They will come to watch you, to listen to you, to know you, if you are a thing so horrible and broken that no one else would dare.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They love the evil things, maybe, best of all, because it’s evil that needs Hell most. If you want to know how the Devils have gone so horribly wrong, it may be that; that, as much as the corruption and their own suffering; that they spend all of their time in the company of the worst of us, and so they’ve come to exemplify that awfulness themselves. But to love the evil things is not their duty but its expression. The work of Hell is to love whatever needs them most; whatever would, without Hell, be alone.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hell’s eyes are open to you. They will not turn away.

rpg,t3_a1k0so,Help with roleplaying a sentient bookI am currently in a game of dragon heist playing a warlock who's patron is a great old one. His conduit to the great old one happens to be a tome that he found in search of more forbidden knowledge. He got the power he was looking for but no he is stuck with the book and the book itself is sentient. The party doesn't know about the book yet because I have been waiting for a good time thematically for it to come up.  I plan to roleplay the book but I am having a hard time coming up with interesting ideas/personalities for the book.  Any of you ever roleplay a sentient item and maybe have any tips or ideas?,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a1k0so/help_with_roleplaying_a_sentient_book/,"['You\'ve probably seen it, but (something very similar to) a sentient book is part of the premise Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\n\nIn that, the book has a goal. So motivation is the key.\n\nWhy does your book involve itself in the world? It can have literally any personality that fits with that, but my guess as to what kind of personality would best keep with the theme of a book would be any of the following tags (some are in direct opposition, I mean that any of them could fit, even if they don\'t all necessarily fit together):\n\n* The Teacher. Think back to every teacher you ever had, and you can see that there\'s more than one way to handle this. There\'s the kindly, inspirational type, the stern authoritarian, the teacher who rarely gives you a straight answer but keeps asking you questions forcing you to dig deeper, the teacher who is very set in their lesson plan ""first do X, then do Y, now do Z,"" the absent-minded professor, etc.\n* The Secret Keeper. What is a book, but a place where secrets are kept, maybe riddles within riddles? This personality can\'t be fully trusted, but the reason why it isn\'t open and upfront could be for good reasons or bad. (Going back to Harry Potter again, Dumbledore was purposely obscure and kept secrets from even his chosen agent, Harry.)\n* The Lost. The book may not truly understand what it even is. Imagine a lowly mind imprinted on a book full of facts and figures which it doesn\'t understand. It could be because pages are missing, which tore some shards from its own mind. Recovering those pages would be of prime importance to the book. Unfortunately, it may have happened so long ago that the original circumstances of their loss aren\'t immediately helpful - the missing pages could be anywhere by now. As the pages are returned to the book, it might remember bits of forgotten lore and parts of a greater mystery which it could reveal a little at a time. Edit: The recovered pages might not restore the mind in a logical order. Imagine the first page recovered was the second-to-last page revealing a huge mystery. The book becomes obsessed with solving this facet of its own history and is driven by the importance of some mystery but doesn\'t yet understand *why* the obsession is important, because that\'s spelled out in earlier missing pages. The book might seem quixotic, a bit mad and out of touch with the real world.', '[Book puns.](https://thoughtcatalog.com/erin-cossetta/2018/06/book-puns/)', 'I’ve never role-played a sentient book or object before, but, I’d assume it should be similar to roleplaying any other character\nThey have a motivation, and a way they treat and react to other people\nSo maybe it could be like the book is a begrudging servant to the warlock? And is pissy and rude to everyone else? Ooh and maybe the book speaks in some eldritch language but only the warlock understands the book and assumes it’s speaking common all the time?', 'How about you use some kind of secret messaging system to relay to him that as the book awakens it sucks his mind inside and traps him in the book, than have the book explain they are one now and it gives him powers of remote control of his bodily function, but he remains detached from his ""sleepwalking body"" and trapped in the book, you can add all kinds of craziness later on top of that. like eyes and mouth on the book that are now his, but are almost indistinguishable from cover when closed. and the book mind that sometimes goes wondering inside his body.', ""Get your hands on a copy of [The Pagemaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEiJecKrFBw).

Oddly he is paranoid about going to prison as he is a deserter. He doesn't want to be locked up.

I also played an Ars Magica mage who was very old and had difficulty making longevity potions that worked well. That shaped his willingness to take commissions which would gain potion materials.

This doesn't shape every character I play, but I was curious how others approach it that aspect, especially when among races that live different lifespans.

Fifth, is the magic system free form, or at least, can it be?

rpg,t3_a1h0g6,"My friend and I self-published his first micro-RPG: Happenstance. It took two years of hard work, but we are finally premiering it at PAX Unplugged this weekend!I met u/kaptain_carbon a couple years of ago through reddit, and turns out we knew each other in real life through a mutual friend. He had designed a really fun 1d6 based system, and posted it on reddit several years ago. I really enjoyed it, and approached him with the idea of publishing it as a full game.

I co-own a small RPG/TTG company, so while Kaptain finished developing the system, my business partner and I contracted art for the box and card backs, and figured out the logistics of getting the game printed.

It's been a long road: what we thought we could do in 6 months took 2 years, but finally after playtesting, test prints, reprints, and hours of work by Kaptain, the game is ready for it's premier!

The game is called [Happenstance](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1795/8453/products/image_8efc1ba9-22c0-46d0-b3f4-cb974431c711_1024x1024.jpg?v=1540264259), and is about a small town surrounded by mysterious ancient ruins that adventurers delve for treasure. It is a very fast (30 minutes/game), very deadly little RPG for playing bars/concerts/while camping. We designed it as a deck so you can carry it with you easily. 

There are four classes players can choose from, each with unique skills, and the Guide (e.g. gamemaster) procedurally generates the dungeon by drawing pregenerated monsters and encounters from the deck. The game is very light on details/rules, allowing GMs a lot of freedom to make the game their own. All successes/failures are determined by 1d6 rolls.

If you want to learn more about Happenstance itself, you can find it on our [website here](https://dicedungeons.com/products/happenstance-game). 

If you will be at PAX unplugged this weekend, we will be running games if you want to try it out!

Also if people are interested, I'm happy to talk budgeting/printing/etc for game designers who want to go it alone, and am happy to share our printer's information (they do a nice job and are very affordable.) We run our company with a bare bones philosophy, so our publishing strategy might be useful for other aspiring game designers.

rpg,t3_a1gkmp,"Which Sci-Fi RPG do you recommend?So, up until now I have only played D&amp;D. For a long time I've wanted to run a sci-fi RPG, and at some point I even created a 2-pages-of-rules pseudo RPG to play sci-fi, since they were like hey can we play this TODAY? 

Anyway I recently read the rules for SWN and at the start I was amazed by how much it feels like what I had in mind I wanted to play, but then I started finding problems... Mainly the psychics. At the start I said ok, I am just gonna alter how they work and make it just a very very advanced TL6 civilization of nanobots that decided for their own reasons to live in the bodies of the TL4 organisms, but then I saw how much the nature of the psychics were a core part of the rules, and I realized how much of them I had to change. It was a LOT. I also didn't like how it handles FTL travel, not mechanically, but lore-wise

So I started thinking like, ok, 25% of the rulebooks goes and I'll re-wright it to suit me... And then I thought wait, there are thousands of RPGs out there, maybe one suits me better?

So here is what I want:
A sci-fi ttrpg, not cyberpunk or something of the like, classic space ships and planets and space. I want something that feels like something between firefly and old man's war, maybe a bit of Bobbiverse in it as well (such great books). More importantly, no magic. None, not even the tiniest bit. Super advanced civilizations with Tec indistinguishable from magic are fine though. 

I love the idea of the players being a crew of a small spaceship, where they explore new places, trade stuff from place A to place B, get ambushed by space pirates etc...

So, which RPG do you recommend, and why? Should I stick with SWN and just re-wright part of the rules, or go for another one? Why is that other one the right choice?


TL;DR

Which one do you recommend and more importantly why?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a1gkmp/which_scifi_rpg_do_you_recommend/,"[""I mean... there *is* a Firefly RPG.\n\nModiphius has Star Trek and Infinity.\n\nSavage Worlds has a scifi hack.\n\nScum &amp; Villainy is new and literally exactly what you want.\n\nFate, my recommendation, has a *bunch* of scifi hacks: Uranium Chef, Andromeda, Red Planet, Ghost Planet, Three Rocketeers, Frontier Spirit, Aether Sea (don't let the trappings fool you), Camelot Trigger, and most recently Tachyon Squadron. For what it's worth, I'm running exactly the sort of game you're asking for right now using a hacked-up Fate Accelerated and borrowing concepts from several of these.\n\nYou could, ugh, use Starfinder if you really wanted to. It'll be comfortably familiar to you, at least, being D20 slop.\n\nThere's Traveler, of course, the big grandaddy of scifi RPGs.\n\nI think I'm obligated to say GURPS.\n\nYou could probably do it in Wrath &amp; Glory, but you're sort of also dealing with all of its inherent 40kisms in the process.\n\nDiaspora and Eclipse Phase are both distant descendants of Fate, but I know nothing about them besides that.\n\nAshen Stars looks pretty good, and uses a cool system inherited from Gumshoe.\n\nLasers &amp; Feelings.

While FTL travel is possible, information travels only as fast as a ship can carry it. Because of this, the isolation of space feels very real, as communications arent instantaneous.

The game is very centered around a crew, their ship, and the story that comes out of their travels through space. While many editions exist and the wealth of information can be daunting, I've found that the core rulebook from Mongoose publishing released in 2008 has everything you need and its layout is excellent.

The magic system (which Ben skims over here) is very clever; there are a bunch of different ways to cast spells which have varying risks and rewards. You can...

* Cast from memory, which requires you to memorize the spell beforehand, causes you to forget the spell immediately (no casting the same spell twice in one day), and you have to roll to control the spell.
* Cast from a formula (spellbook, scroll), which destroys the formula and requires you to roll to control the spell. Since this includes spells written in a spellbook, a mage can opt to permanently lose their own spells to cast in a pinch if the situation is truly that desperate.
* Cast as a ritual which allows you to spend a ton of time (one hour per spell level) to cast a spell from a formula without destroying the formula. You can then choose between rolling to control the spell despite spending hours casting it, or destroy the formula anyway to guarantee that it casts as intended.

Wizards have options to retain spells cast from memory, and various other classes tweak the spellcasting rules in different, minor ways. Spells have levels, but anyone can cast any spell, regardless of level or whether or not they're a spellcaster. Casting spells higher than your level makes you more likely to fail on your roll to control the spell, triggering a roll on the fantastic miscast table. Spellcasting isn't limited only to dedicated casting classes, and every aspect of it is steeped in risks and rewards, guaranteeing that invoking magic *never* becomes boring.

Best of all is that there's [a free version of the game](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/196352/The-Nightmares-Underneath-Free-Edition?term=the+nightmares&amp;test_epoch=0) so you can check out the concepts for yourself.

Likewise, there are people who regularly play tabletop RPGs but never play D&amp;D. Playing D&amp;D isn't synonymous with tabletop roleplaying among the community she is interested in.\n\nThe survey seems to be trying to find a connection between tabletop RPGs and withdrawing from/avoiding/being overwhelmed by current events. That *might* make sense if she could show that the popularity of tabletop RPGs rose and fell at the same time that anxiety regarding current events waxed and waned.

rpg,t3_a1f6cz,"Sword &amp; Scoundrel is in Open Beta*Sword &amp; Scoundrel* is a player-driven tabletop role-playing game of passion, violence, and general skullduggery. Set against a gritty renaissance backdrop, Sword &amp; Scoundrel is a morality play presented as an HBO character drama, where players declare what is most important to their character and see it challenged through play. It's a blood opera of intrigue and swordplay, exploring how far you will go, what lines you will cross, and what — or *who* — you are willing to sacrifice for what you hold most dear. 


S&amp;S is a passion project that I've been working on for the better part of six years now. In that time, it's gone through a few iterations and we've gained a small, but devoted following. With this most recent release, I've decided to start looking for fresh eyes to test it. Above all, what any would-be game designer needs is feedback. 


The beta document is available at [drivethrurpg](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/259404/Sword--Scoundrel-Open-Beta-Document), where it is and will remain free of charge. 


It currently contains everything you need for basic play, including the core mechanics, character creation, combat system, and the weapon/armor customization rules. We're currently drafting the GM material, though if you have any familiarity with The Burning Wheel, The Riddle of Steel, or Apocalypse World, you can run this without missing a beat. 


As the beta progresses, we plan on introducing a fully-developed sorcery system, social combat, faction support, and a few other goodies still to come. 


Thanks for reading this far. I'm more than happy to answer any questions you might have.

rpg,t3_a1eqj0,"Faerie Tales &amp; Folklore&gt; Children Vanishing Into The Otherworld

&gt; This setting/game idea is best used in more modern campaigns (from the 16th century on) as it is focused around the difficulty of getting adults into the Otherworld. In this setting, players will be searching for lost members of the community (most specifically children), who have been disappearing at an alarming rate. Concepts such as the mundane versus the otherworldly will play a central role in such narratives. As is common within the settings of Faerie Tales &amp; Folklore, one of the primary issues a group must contend with is how they are to cross the veil (often repeatedly). This type of tale can also be turned on its head and played from the point of view of the children who are either hiding from the reality of their lives in the mundane world, or are being held prisoner by some villain of an otherworldly nature.

rpg,t3_a1e43h,"Worst game for skills obtained vs. skills available: FOUND!Lately I've been interested in how skill-based RPGs apportion those skill levels. On one extreme, there are games like Fate, where there are only 18 possible skills, and every player has 10 of them, for a 9:5 ratio. (Or roughly 2:1 if you want an easier ratio to remember.) On the other end of things, there are games like GURPS, where (in the 3rd edition basic set) there are 178 skills and most players have 18-20, for a 10:1 ratio (and a HUGE number of relatively useless skills no one will ever even select, from Agronomy to Underwater Demolition, so the practical ratio is probably closer to 5:1).

Other games:

***Savage Worlds:*** usually 23-28 possible skills, average player has 6-8 skills. **Ratio: roughly 4:1.**

&amp;#x200B;

***Call of Cthulhu:*** 85 possible skills, average player has 17-20 skills. **Ratio: roughly 4.25:1**

&amp;#x200B;

***Stars Without Number:*** 18 possible skills, 3-5 starting skills. **Ratio: roughly 4.5:1**.

&amp;#x200B;

***Traveller:*** If you count ""cascade skills"" as single skills (Gun Combat instead of Slug Pistol, Slug Rifle, Energy Pistol, etc.), Classic Traveller (Book 1) has 26 possible skills, and 4-6 starting on average. **Ratio: 5:1.**

(If you break out cascade skills like Blade Combat into spear, blade, sword, foil, cutlass, etc., it's closer to 8:1)Mongoose Traveller/Cepheus Engine has 68 possible skills, and 10 to start with on average. **Ratio: 7:1.**

&amp;#x200B;

For the longest time, I thought Traveller and GURPS (depending on how you count them) had a lock on the skills-possible-to-skills-obtained ratio...but just recently I came across ***Other Suns***, a vintage 1983 sci-fi game from Fantasy Games Unlimited, which lists 128 possible skills...including Business Arrangements Law (""the skill level exercised in this skill may not be higher than a player's rating in Legal Semantics"" which is also in there), Contact Xenology (first contact specialization), Procedural Law, Rapid Odds Calculation, Robopsychology, Skiing (why not?) and Topology (so useful!).

What's worse is, a player can start with as few as THREE of them! (If you choose to be a Martial Artist, you get Disarm, Evade, and Hand-to-Hand, and you apparently know nothing about anything else.) The average player will have 10 skills...for a whopping 13:1 ratio of skills available to skills actually seen on your character. If there is a greater example of skill malpractice in the hobby, I don't know where it might be hiding.

If anyone here has any experience with actually playing ***Other Suns***, I'd love to hear about it. It has 12 characteristics, including not only Strength and Endurance, but also--bafflingly--Build, Size, Length, and Telepathic Strike Capability! Just reading the book gives me a headache.

For example, in many if not most D6 system games, many skills can be assumed to be at the same level as the governing attribute, even if the character doesn\'t have any skill noted on their character sheet. (There are exceptions, of course.)\n\nEdit: Meaning that in a D6 game, if you want your character to be pretty good at every agility-based skill, you could prioritize your agility attribute, then dump all of your skill selections into skills associated with other attributes.

She can use any pistol and any small blade weapon in the game. She can also use Brawling (improvised weapons and fists) which every character has.\n\nI don\'t think to have a ton of skills in the game and her character having (by choice) access to only 8 of them has made it difficult for her to play her character.

rpg,t3_a1dydk,"Looking for a short, single-location adventure to run. Any recommendations?A few things I'm looking for:

* For D&amp;D or D&amp;D-like game. Any edition. 

* Set in a single location but not necessarily a single dungeon. e.g.  A building with multiple floors/rooms; a network of caves; a contained underground lair; etc....

* Short but not tiny, i.e. not one of those 1-2 page adventures. Something that will last a few sessions. 

* A balance between combat and role-playing. Something with a nice plot, a nice cast of characters, but also with opportunities for the players to kick-ass. 

* Preferably revolving around a single ""villain"" type character -- though I'd consider alternatives too. 

* Bonus points if it's an Old-School adventure (not a big deal though)

Enjoy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a1bk8d/sandboxification/,"[""What you call ad lib, I call improv, and yes, thats definitely sandboxing.  The key feature of sandboxing is player agency above plan.  You could plan your ass off and have a beautiful elegant story, but if the players decide 'screw that' you've gotta go with the flow.  Doesn't mean you can't create a whole new pot just as deep as your original plot, but the winds of the world and the things the party gets up to is entirely chosen by the party.\n\nYou can even have rails in a sandbox once the party has chosen their goals, but its the players choosing which goals and choosing when to bail on those goals and run down a different rabbit hole instead on a whim.  That is sandboxing.\n\nIf you've planned every detail down the path to the right and your players choose the path to the left that you haven't planned a damn thing of... you have two options.  Xanatos (where what you put on the right suddenly appears on the left) or improv (ad lib).  People frown on xanatos but if you're good at improv the players should never know.  But when players see a clear chance to examine your prepared plot and say directly 'no, we're not doing that... we're not going there', you cant just let xanatos magically keep dropping that carrot in front of them hoping they'll change their mind and chase it like you hoped.  You gotta figure out what the new carrot is and start figuring out what makes those choices challenging and iteresting instead.\n\nPlayer agency takes priority. That's the sandbox.\n\nRailroading is when every fork in the road is a xanatos choice.  All paths lead to point b, which you've prepared ahead of time and nothing the players choose can stop them from eventually arriving at point b.  If you choose an incontrovertible situation that the players have no choice t avoid... thats railroading.  Ain't nothin wrong with railroading with some players.  Some folks cant get moving unless you choose an imporant thing for them to move towards, but railroading is when you chose the point b and the players can't ignore it and go a different way."", ""&gt; Where are your games on there? What would you call that? Are all hex crawls sandboxes? Certainly all sand boxes are not hex crawls.\n\nWhy not? I mean apart from the fairly unimportant part of organizing things by a hex grid.\n\nI think the expectation of high world prep is for a couple of reasons. One is that it stops a DM improving into 'all roads lead to rome' play, which is a form of railroading. Sure, he'll improvise but you always end up at the quantum ogre.\n\nThe other is a feeling of the world being there, rather than spawning in just around each corner as you move.

rpg,t3_a1a64q,"How to synthesize pre-written infoHello - 

The forgotten realms over it's 40 some odd year history has so much information to absorb it's a bit daunting.  It's completely insane! Just one nation has reams of information to parse and remember. What are your strategies for learning and retaining data about all of the people, places, and other stuff that one needs to recall to run the game?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a1a64q/how_to_synthesize_prewritten_info/,"['My strategy is to follow the guideline, ""If it isn\'t relevant to the adventure and more specifically the session coming up in a few days ignore it.""  And if it\'s something I can\'t just look up quickly in a session, I\'ll improvise.  So use your sessions as a sort of focal point on what you might want to look up in the lore.\n\nOn established settings in general...  The thing about lore is that it\'s usually never important and only serves to get in the way especially if the GM gets too cozy with the lore and wants it to stand out.  Back in ADnD days, the Dark Sun and Dragonlance campaigns fell to this with a lot of GMs insisting the players follow the path of the established lore.  You\'re trying to create new lore after all with the players as the stars of the story.  Just my opinion on the importance of learning established lore.', ""Don't worry about it much. It's only a backdrop to your table's story. Know the recent events of the immediate local, maybe use that for some potential hooks or sidequests, fluff out dialogue and rumors, nothing more.\n\nWhen you try and make such background things plentiful, obvious, or important, they just come off badly and aren't interesting."", ""Use want you want. Ignore what you don't need. Make up stuff anything you feel like it. Professional science fiction and fantasy writers rarely stay consistent with their background lore, so don't beat yourself up over an RPG. "", ""&gt; The forgotten realms over it's 40 some odd year history has so much information to absorb it's a bit daunting.\n\nThis doesn't directly answer your question.  But i'm just putting it out there.  You don't actually need know all that stuff.\n\nYour Forgotten Realms doesn't need to be identical to anybody else's.  Use the parts you like and have read-- and make up the rest."", ""I'm going through the same, but i think the best method i've found so far, is to take dives into 1 aspect, get to a point where i think i could explain a Nation, God, Class, Race, Monster, Mythos etc to an OK degree to another person, and then moving on to the next aspect. Go for more detail if it's specifically something you see yourself using in the next month as a DM/player.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for my last couple weeks, this has been Curse of Strahd - reading the book itself, first page to last, Orcs and Grummsh lore, Goblinoid lore, Planescape/Sigil, Devils vs Demons. Sometimes just getting a surface level appreciation of one makes the next topic make more sense as well."", ""I've never played Forgotten Realms so I'm not sure how relevant or successful my strategy would be if applied to that game setting.  But for the Warhammer setting I found the best approach was to rationalise the setting information into a logical set of world mechanics.  By making sure I understood the logic behind the setting I found it much easier to both remember and present the informaiton to the players.  Also the process of establishing the rational explanation actually helped me remember the information.\n\nAs far as the question about remembering people. places and other stuff (essential for retaining the continuity and integrity of the the game itself) that was done with the help of an excel spreadsheet in which was recorded all the background detail that needed to be referred to in order to keep the game consistent.  So for example NPC's once created were recorded in the spreadsheet with the context of their existence and any key facts about them.  So, that if the party returned to that location the same NPC would greet them, or at least be remembered by friends and family.  \nThis even included information or characters and places mentioned in the Warhammer novels where appropriate, so that parties visiting well know locations would actually recognise them and the people they met if they had read the book.  \n\n\nSo for example:  \n\nMurdo Maclaghlan: The burglar king. Claims to be an exiled Prince of Albion. Wears tartan breeches, long moustache. Woodelf tattoo's on his arms. However, his real name is Heinrik Schmidt and he was born in Nuln and has never left the city.  Souce: Skavenslayer\n\n "", ""Keep in mind it's all there *in case* you need it. The best strategy is to just get a high level overview of the world and generally absorb the tone and feel so anything you improvise is actually plausible. I'd suggest picking a small area that interests you and become an expert in that then let the other information that is connected to it come organically."", 'In general, the best way to help yourself synthesize information of any type is to teach it to someone else. \n\nAs far as learning setting detail goes, there are two approaches: top-down and bottom-up.\n\nThe top-down approach starts ""zoomed out"", with a high-level overview of things at the level of nations and decades or centuries. You get broad-strokes information, enough for a basic feel, but without ""filling in"" much of the detail. This lets you keep your improvisation on-theme better, and allows you to drill down into specific relevant or interesting topics.\n\nThe bottom-up approach is just the opposite: you start with something very small (like a single city, or a district within that city, or even a single person) and examine it in great detail, and as those details imply connections to other parts of the world, your scope slowly expands to those too. This gives you access to hard-and-fast fine detail about small, immediate things, but at the expense of the bigger picture.\n\nBoth methods have their uses, and the best strategy is to use both as needed.', 'Depends on what your running?   \nIf your running an Adventure Path read that and if any areas/towns interest you and you might want to run more adventures in that area then read more on that area.   \n\n\nIf your running a more open adventure in the world or creating your own adventure in The Realms, get a hold of the most recent setting guide, read it, get ideas on areas you want players to go/ sites for adventures, then find more info on those areas including what happened in the past in previous products about them. Only delve that deep if the area in question will be a campaign focus and you feel like you want to make it feel really rich and important.']"

rpg,t3_a196rk,"Question: Running high PC fatality rate campaigns?  

Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to give some context to my question:

&amp;#x200B;

I’m currently in the process of planning a low/no magic, high realism, west marches-esque (10-15 players, but no more than 5 per session), campaign. Setting is based on the Viking Age and Norse mythology (magic and such introduced mid/late campaign).

&amp;#x200B;

The system I intend on using is based on another campaign I ran. It’s skill based, constructed from a hybrid of a few different published systems (mainly Chronicles of Darkness and Burning Wheel).

&amp;#x200B;

The idea for combat and survival is brutal realism. Highly skilled and well armored/armed characters will be tough to actually hurt and kill, but one serious wound can be deadly for anyone. Less skilled and less armored characters (many will be early on) are at serious risk of death in any encounter. 

&amp;#x200B;

My hope is, as characters grow stronger and get better armored while many die off, the ones that persist become legends among the clans. I think the potentially high fatality rate makes the campaign more realistic, adds a sense of danger to every encounter and value to those that survive.

&amp;#x200B;

But, here is my concern. What happens if a PC gets killed early on in a session?

(and I can’t have someone just sit out for the next 3-4 hours)

&amp;#x200B;

I’m probably having players generate multiple characters from the start so that the characters already exist in the world for continuity, but I feel like dropping a character in, out of the blue, could be immersion breaking, especially when a group may range multiple days away from their village. The rest of the world is going to be fairly hostile, so it would be very unrealistic for a stranger to just wander in and join the party.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m thinking about requiring the players to take a long 2 x Number of Players of PC’s along for any journey exceeding 1 day so everyone has at least a spare. These “spares” could then be a retinue that just sets up camp nearby?

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone that has played in or GM’ed a high fatality rate game (Call of Cthulhu?), how have you handled frequent PC deaths and introducing new PC’s without it seeming really forced or unrealistic?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm happy to hear any thoughts and suggestions on running this sort of campaign!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Planning a new campaign with a high PC death rate, how have you seen or you handled introducing new PC’s while maintaining continuity and immersion?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a196rk/question_running_high_pc_fatality_rate_campaigns/,"['When you plan to run a game with high fatality, one of the usual pieces of advice is you always bring the player in asap.  The narrative/immersion reasoning is secondary and can always be made in retrospect.  You mainly want to do this, because the players have come to play not sit and watch.  If it\'s a game with henchmen and npcs, then I also offer for them to just take over one of those characters.  Typically if you have a group that likes high fatality games, they aren\'t married to their characters as in a traditional game.  So those types of players are usually more willing and often even like the opportunity to jump around characters.  Just make sure that once they are ready you get them back into play.\n\nHaving spares is also a good idea, especially if you have some sort of minimum level you keep the scale the campaign at.  Some systems also are just a pain in the butt to build characters so it can be good to have backups ready.  That way less time is required to build, the new character can just come into play at the next good moment (typically after the encounter/trap that killed them).\n\nJust make sure you decide upon when ""reinforcements"" arrive and let the players know so they can include that fact in their strategic decisions and planning.  For example, if you say ""new characters come in when you rest"" the party knows that they should find a good rest spot (maybe they\'re in a hostile dungeon) so they can ""find"" their new party member.  The loss of a party member risks a death spiral anyway, so they will most likely withdraw (perhaps with your encouragement).', 'Hirelings might be a solution: if something happens to a PC, maybe the camp cook or mule handler grabs a spear and joins the party (at least until a proper new PC can be introduced). \n\nThe other possibility is the classic “sole survivor” sort of situation: the new PC is rescued from the prison cell, or perhaps wanders into the camp after being lost for days... which might not be strictly “realistic” if used too often. \n\nAnd you’ve said it’s a dangerous, hostile world, but perhaps you could pepper in a few traveling encounters with friendly/neutral parties of other adventurers throughout the campaign. Then, if something happens to a regular PC, it might be more plausible to recruit a new party member the PCs already “know.”', ""Are sure your players even want this? While I'd enjoy playing in a campaign like that for a change the reason I never get to is because for every player who likes it there's another player who hates it passionately enough to shoot your dog for suggesting the idea and 3-4 players who kind of don't like it much."", ""A thing to consider, if you already have players controlling more than one character each, is having the action happen in several places at the same time, with players taking over various hirelings and other minor NPCs in scenes where they don't have a proper PC. A setup similar to Ars Magica.\n\nThis has an additional advantage of making players used to not having a full PC in every scene that is played - so if somebody's main character dies, it doesn't feel weird to only play side characters until the group gets to a place where a new character may smoothly join.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also suggest having something that players may identify with, bigger than individual characters. A family/clan, a religion, an organization, a prophesied destiny. This gives a sense of continuity and direction even when characters die. Otherwise you may end up in a middle of a story arc with all characters that started it already dead and the current characters not really having a reason to continue what their predecessors did."", 'Campaign structure is important, and this is unfortunately a place where magic is pretty helpful. When I\'ve done these games, I\'ve usually had the group running a company, or having a \'ship\' or some other retreat near by. Something needs to bind the party together beyond death. I have people roll back-up characters up front who are _doing_ things in universe, but not in the limelight. It helps to ask players what their other guys are doing now and then just to keep their existence in the back of everyone\'s head.\n\nIf someone dies, well, we handhave as much as possible to get that person back in. It\'s often _""What a coincidence!""_  and not realistic. But this is a place where realism is really f\'ing boring and it needs to take a hike.\n\nThis is also a good place to insert another twist. Some \'PC insertion\' prompts that you can fill yourself or leave for the players:\n\n* B-team guy was captured and the players are nearby to free him; how did he get there?\n* B-team is doing something convenient near by for the plot. Running an errand, pursuing a lead no one thought was related. What is it?\n* B-team arrives with a letter, bearing news from HQ. What\'s the news?\n\nIf you have the time (like the death occurs near end of session):\n\n* A-team\'s death has triggered an obligation for B-team to fulfill, like an agreement, shared regret, blood-oath, or something else. What is it?\n* A-team is looking for new recruits, and B-team is impressing. What is the feat they witness?\n\n\nLots of character death makes it really hard for players to commit to a story. Try to get them to create paths that either multiple generations can pick up, or are beyond their own life to accomplish. A particular contract for a particular villain\'s head isn\'t a bad example.\n\nJust as a parting note since it raised my eyebrows...\n\n&gt; \u200blow/no magic, high realism, west marches, high fatality, (I think) homebrew, norse mythology\n\nYou should make sure that players are really into this, because these tags throw up a lot of red flags for me. Character death, west marches and high realism are usually a lot more fun for a GM than the PCs who can\'t see the full picture and are being boned on checks and having to make new characters. But some players are also really into it. Not a criticism, just a warning that you\'re heading into a _hard_ game to do right and will need to advertise correctly.', 'This may not be what you are looking for, but one idea I was toying with was having PC\'s that were knocked out of the game (which would include dead, unconscious, or delirious) continue to play in a spirit world.  So, basically they become a ghost, and end up having their own adventure alongside their active colleagues.  They can\'t actually aide their colleagues, but instead have a sort of mini-adventure of their own.\n\nI never got to use this idea for a dead PC, although I had some ideas on how i would do it.  But I did use it once or twice to keep players whose characters were temporarily incapacitated busy.\n\nIt also gives the GM a chance to feed characters advice and guidance from spiritial sources such as gods or ancestors.  One of the examples from ym own game was the thief Bertoldo, who was knocked unconscious by his angry father during a session involving the local mafia leader Don Valentina.\n\n&gt;Don Valantina isn\'t surprised at Guisseppi\'s assault on his son, knowing him well and sensing the mans anger. It won\'t hurt his purposes to have the boy scared witless.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However he reasons he will learn nothing about Bertoldo\'s activities and their implications for his organisation if the boy is killed and so acts quickly to prevent it by commanding Guisseppi to stop and if necessary allowing Dominico to restrain him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""NO GUISSEPPI! I understand\'a your anger, but there are questions we must ask of the boy.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Besides, if Guisseppi is behind it all, killing Bertoldo would cover his involvement nicely, and while the Don\'s instincts tell him his old friend would not betray him he hasn\'t stayed in power so long by refusing to consider possibilities out of sentiment.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;""Now! Now!"" growls Fratonni stepping forward to assist Dominco to restraint his father ""Can\'t have you killing the boy until we have had a chance to get the truth out of him can we""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(Grapple Test: Dominco and Antonnio: Success, Dexerity Test: Guisseppi Failed)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Dominco and Antonnio pounce on Guisseppi and grabbing one arm each restrain him until his anger abates.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""Nutting bud trouble, that boy. Nutting."" he growls ""He is a disgrace to me and my family.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bertoldo lies unmoving on the carpet.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Meanwhile, Bertoldo is floating in the tranquil darkness enjoying the peace and for the first time today relaxed and happy.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;A small glimmer of light in the distance catches his attention and he is drawn towards it. Moving easily and without effort through the void, he draws nearer and realises that the light is a flickering candle flame.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;A candle sitting on a table.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Beside the table is a chair, a tall backed comfortable chair.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Occupied by a small thin man with ferret like face dressed in loose fitting black clothes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He wears a large black broad brimmed felt hat which hides his eyes.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;On the mans lap lays a thin black cat and the man\'s bony fingers stroke it continuously. ""Aahh! Bertoldo"" he says mockingly without looking up ""having a bad day.""  \nBertoldo replies while looking around ""Who are you? Where am I? This doesn\'t look like \'Don\' Valentino\'s study""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The old man looks up from his cat and smiles his eyes twinkling with mischievious amusement. ""I am your destiny Bertoldo and this"" he says with a gesture of his thin bony hand ""…this is no where"" he smiles ""…and everywhere.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""But you my boy are in Don Valantino\'s study, and we must do something about that mustn\'t we."" he says leaning forward and staring up at Bertoldo to emphasis the seriousness of his words.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""He has nothing to fear. He has done nothing wrong"" says a soft female voice from the darkness.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""HA!"" snarls the old man throwing himself back in the chair ""Since when has that mattered.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A woman emerges from the darkness and Bertoldo recognises her instantly as his mother Maria. ""Tell the truth Bertoldo. You have done nothing wrong."" she says imploringly.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""Tell the truth Bertoldo"" mimic\'s the old man. He turns to Bertoldo angrily ""Do you want to see the truth Bertoldo, then look at it?""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The old man gestures with his hand and the image of Bertoldo\'s mother changes as her face is covered in bruises, she is bleeding from the mouth and one of her eyes is swollen and closed. ""That is the truth Bertoldo."" snarls the old man "" and that is what the truth will earn you.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was an image of his mother that Bertoldo had witnessed all too often during his youth. His mother covered in bruises and clearly in pain yet always ready to listen to his future plans and schemes with an encouraging word.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""Hear me Bertoldo"" snarls the old man with a hint for menance in his voice ""More people have died for the truth than ever died for a lie.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""Don\'t listen to him. Bertoldo"" implores your mother ""…he seeks to draw you into his devious schemes.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The old man laughs ""Oh! what a wicked web we weave when first we practice to deceive."" he says sarcastically ""OH! WHAT A PAINFUL PATH WE TREAD WHEN WE DECIDE TO TELL THE TRUTH INSTEAD."" he adds and suddenly they are both gone and Bertoldo is alone in the darkness.\n\nI\'m not sure how one would do this in a roundtable game, but this was an actual extract form the log of my PBEM, and the unconscious Bertoldo was visited by his dead mother and a manifestation of Ranald (the god of theives) presenting him with a summary of his current predicament and a choice/warning and confirmation that Ranald was  watching his actions closely.', '1) Don’t be that dick that treats the game like DND. When I DM CoC, PCs can end up lasting a whole campaign, and rarely does any player end up playing more than 3 PCs within a campaign. Encounters are meant to be sparse in these sorts of systems, and if you play like that, it’s not excessively brutal.\n\n2) Unless we’re in a very climactic set piece (in which case I might just give them a Villain or tag-along NPC to play for the time being), I try and incorporate the new PC as soon as possible. It’s okay to strain plausibility if it means getting them back in soon enough. Captives of the bad guys are a great resource from which new PCs can come.']"

Their culture *wasn't* actually in the game, it was just decoration. I wouldn't blame WotC for this one—it seems the fault lies with the consultants for advising too much caution.\n\nAs a cultural consultant, you have a self-interest to play it safe with the artists you are consulting for—if you say something is OK and it turns out it wasn't OK, it's much much worse for your career than if you said something isn't OK but actually is.

Looks to be a lot different than yours. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, question: I'd like to think that I do representation well. I make sure to have characters of multiple ethnic backgrounds in games where it's appropriate (most named, human NPCs that I write for Star Trek are of non-European heritage). If it's a historical or pseudo-historical setting, things can get tricky, but even in my samurai game I've got an analog of Yasuke, the African samurai. In such games I never represent any culture as evil, only with different goals. That said, I've got a problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother product that I've got on the low burner is a series of short supplements about various 'taurs and beastmen. For example the first book is centaurs, donkeytaurs, zebrataurs, bisontaurs and cameltaurs. I've consulted with a LOT of people about this one, because I think it has to be handled right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nITRW you find zebras in Africa. I imagine that a lot of folks would probably have the image of a black man on top of a zebra when they think zebrataur. I worry that if I go down that route for the artwork, I'm gonna fall off of a slippery slope. Like then people are gonna want to see bisontaurs wearing feathered headdresses and cameltaurs in keffiyeh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to basically boil POC down to stereotypical animals. One solution that one of the artists I want to use offered was to represent as many real-world cultures as possible in the series, but to have them not be beastmen or taurs of an animal from their home region. His specific example was to have a giraffetaur's human section not look Arican, but like a Thai woman who uses jewelry to make her neck look longer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure I particularly like that specific example. I can see people thinking that we're making caricatures of real people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the secondary goals of this project is to release the art that I commission as a resource for other publishers to use. I think there's a dearth of beastmen and imaginative taurs available for stock use, and I want to have dozens of different species available. It's not acceptable to me to make them all white men (he ethnicity from which most of my heritage derives).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do I find the right balance of representation and respect?"", 'Lula/Temer']"

rpg,t3_a17eea,"This week on Filling in the Gaps: ‘Gary Gearbot is All In’. We took a gamble this week but have we hit jackpot? What’s your ideas?We started brainstorming a session based in a couple casino with the scenario of ‘slowly transforming’. We came up with the idea of a ‘Slot Golem’ and built stats and attacks for him. But what ideas would you have ? 

We are looking for ideas to help develop this idea and make it into a runnable session for anyone to play. Have you ever ran something similar to this before? 

",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a17eea/this_week_on_filling_in_the_gaps_gary_gearbot_is/,"[""I'll use Genesys for examples for my idea, but it should be easy to translate into other systems.\n\nThe Slot Golem is an intimidating metallic golem, with two stocky legs and two powerful, thick arms ending in forged fists, which it uses to attack - typically. These are Stone Fists, with Linked 1, Disorient 1, and Knockdown.\n\nWhenever the Slot Golem begins its turn, it spins its reels, and the GM rolls 3d10, each d10 determining the result of one of its three reels, based on the table below. Each symbol contributes an effect even when not a part of a jackpot. On a jackpot, the Golem casts a powerful spell in addition to its action that turn.\n\nHowever, unfortunately for the PCs, the Golem is rigged. It can spend three Advantages or a Triumph on a check to roll an additional d10 next turn, selecting three results from the final pool of d10s to keep for its reels.\n\nTypically it will attack whoever is engaged with it, but it prioritizes foes avoiding it with its jackpot spells.\n\nNumber | Result | Effect | Jackpot Effect\n---|---|---|---\n1-5 | Fruit | A fruit-shaped crystal bottle filled with something like Regeneration Elixir tumbles out of the Slot Golem's drop bucket onto the ground a Short range from it. Whoever drinks it or crushes it, receives the benefits of the Regeneration Elixir. | The Slot Golem swiftly crushes the bottle before it tumbles out of the drop bucket, receiving the benefits of a Regeneration Elixir immediately.\n6 | Bell | The Slot Golem produces a deafening clang with its fists. Foes are deafened for a single round, and take Stun Damage equal to half the damage dealt by the attack. | The Slot Golem creates a stunning and deafening shockwave of sound. This is an attack at Medium range with Blast, Knockdown, and Disorient 1, that deals Stun Damage.\n7 | Seven | The Slot Golem drains the luck from its foes. It rolls an additional d10 next turn, and selects three results for its reels from the final dice pool. Foes are befallen by bad luck. In Genesys, this adds the Misfortune effect from Curse to its attack. | The Slot Golem rolls a *single* 1d10 next turn, and gets a jackpot of that symbol. It casts Curse with Misfortune and Doom with Long range.\n8 | Horseshoe | The Slot Golem gains a boost in speed, gaining the benefits of Haste and Swift from the Augment action. | The Slot Golem gains the benefits of Haste and Swift, in addition to immediately attacking again.\n9 | Diamond | The Slot Golem spills out a dizzying array of riches - 1d100 currency worth - in the immediate vicinity. On the battlefield, they are slippery - the GM may spend a Threat on a PC's check to have them fall prone as they slip on the treasures, and spend three Threats to deal a Wound as a sharp diamond or other treasure hurts them. | The Slot Golem becomes as hard as diamond briefly, gaining +3 Melee and Ranged Defense until the end of its next turn.\n10 | BAR | The Slot Golem's attack has Concussive, and it adds a Setback to all spellcasting checks as it hinders magical abilities. | The Slot Golem casts Curse with Paralyze, and automatically Counterspells all spells cast until the beginning of its next turn.\n\nIn addition, the Slot Golem has a lever on it. If the lever is pulled - which requires a grappling-style Brawl check against its Brawl - then the PC's get a corresponding bonus. However, they only receive bonuses on jackpots. They may flip a story point to roll an additional d10, etc. etc.\n\nResult | Jackpot Effect\n---|---\nFruit | The Golem spits out a fruit-shaped bottle of Regeneration Elixir.\nBell | The Slot Golem falls prone and is disoriented.\nSeven | The PC flips a story point to their side, and gets an upgrade to their next check.\nHorseshoe | The PC immediately may take another maneuver.\nDiamond | The Slot Golem sprays forth 2d100 treasures.\nBAR | The Slot Golem's reels lock up on its next attack, stuck halfway between results, and thus achieving nothing.\n\nIf the Slot Golem has any minions helping it out in the encounter, they can pull its lever instead of taking their turn for the same Jackpots as the Golem's table, but with no results otherwise.""]"

It's vision of 40k characters is very much heroic, forced into a D&amp;D adventurer model.\n\nIt feels way too upbeat and noble, like the characters don't live in a universe spiralling out of control towards destruction. The grimdark doesn't come through. There are no heroes in the 40K universe, and you can't translate an Inquisitors influence into a die-roll.\n\nThe game system itself is like 40k Shadowrun. I have several Shadowrun players and they all made this comment individually. If you like Shadowrun you'll probably like W&amp;G. To me it often seems more complicated than it needs to be, but read the review to decide. Outside of the review, I think the tier system is a poorly described mess.\n"", 'I like Wrath and Glory a more than I expected. It\'s good to finally free the 40k RPG line from it\'s WHFRP baggage. FFG was already moving towards this with Dark Heresy 2e, but starting from scratch and acknowledging that Inquisitorial acolytes or a rogue trader\'s inner circle really shouldn\'t be modelled with a system designed to handle careers like baker and dog catcher is a huge improvement.\n\nThat said I still feel it\'s a mistake to release a single ""Warhammer 40k RPG"" instead of dividing the setting up into slightly different lines. A game of Rogue Trader has a totally different tone than a game of Only War or Dark Heresy, and trying to combine them into a single unified game inevitably weakens that and trying to divide things by tier just doesn\'t cut it.', 'When reading the mechanics section it reminded me of SWFFG and Genesys, but with extra steps', 'Anybody knows when physical copies will be available?

What exactly should i create? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a16po8/how_to_organize_a_micro_scenario_for_roleplayng/,"[""You're going to have to give us more details here.   Game system matters.   Your objective in creating the scenario matters.  How comfortable you are making stuff up on the fly matters. \n\nThis question is not answerable as-is."", ""Without much information to go on, I guess the first points are these:\n\nWhat do you want them to know that will help develop the story (ie, give them suspense or fear, or something to refer to later)?\n\nHow much of a knowledge of 'the scenario' do you want them to have? For instance if they're in a city where they've been for a while, maybe they know about the collisions between rival gangs and the ramping tensions, or they've experienced the rolling blackouts that started up a few weeks ago.\n\nWith a short one-shot game, giving them the story hooks and the background in a subtle way is the key. Think what you want them to lean towards, or piece together, and give them the edges of it, or the building blocks, then let them uncover the rest or the truth as you go on."", ""It really depends on skill level and what game you're playing (as was already mentioned below), personally there are some game systems I just have a hand written single page with a basic plot-investigation outline tree and a list of NPC names appropriate to the setting with blanks next to them - so I can fill in who they are as they're needed in the plot. I may have something like Jerry (Rude and Suspicious) and Jack (A Thief and Conman) or Jill (Lovable and friendly) etc. \n\nBut if I went into a game system I'm less innately familiar with, like the complexities of running an Aberrant Game, I might want more detialed NPCs with stats and maps or larger plot things going on in the background. "", 'Are you talking about a one shot (or 2-3 sessions) or you\'re going to be a substitute GM for a few sessions?\n\n\nIf it\'s a one shot or almost a one shot, a lot of the work falls on them. They need to give it an honest try and accept the basic idea behind the story. In a big campaign, there\'s time to do sandboxing and fool around a bit, not in small self contained scenarios.\n\n\nArguing that you should have a check to prevent the car/plane/flying-boat from crashing in a regular game is okay, it\'s refusing to be railroaded. If that\'s the opener to the one-shot, players needs to accept it or the GM is forced to say ""Congratulation, you did not crash. Your characters go on without ever knowing the horror the escaped or the treasures they missed. Wanna play Catan guys?"" A good fix for that is to be as transparent as possible, you can state the game starts after they all crashed in dangerous territory  or that it\'s going to be a political intrigue or whatever before they even make their characters.\n\n\nAlso, they don\'t get to slowly grow into their characters, they have to jump right in. Sometime it\'s awkward or the character mutates quite a bit in the first 30 minutes before they settle on something comfortable, but a lot of the work is on the player. Also, they need to invest and care for their character even if they\'ll only play it for a few hours . (It\'s also a good opportunity to play more recklessly than usual, it\'s not all bad.)\n\n\nIn other words, make sure your players know what they are getting into and are willing to make it work. If one of them isn\'t so excited about the concept or the idea of a short game, maybe they should sit that one out instead of risking spoiling the fun of the rest of the table.']"

*From Saga Games Studio, the people behind EctoCast: an Actual Play Ghostbusters RPG...*

The world always knew there were monsters under the bed. The world knew there were boogeymen in closets. The world knows there are things in the woods. Things neither human, nor animal. The world has turned a blind eye on these known things.

There is one emotion that can barricade a person’s natural desire to know what’s out there in the world. Fear.

One day something changed. Something forced that fearful world to break down the barricade and fight. Fight or be defeated. Defeat is not an option.

Welcome to the new world of Unbroken.

Join Boris, Sasha, Walter, Nora, and Jacob as they navigate the new world order in this modern urban fantasy setting using the Urban Shadows system.

**Ep2 - Uncovered Secrets:**

Hell Is Empty - Part 2:

Sasha learns of Walter's dark past with Old Country Estates.

Jacob is called away as Boris and Nora investigate the Estates themselves.

Finally, a dark force makes itself known to the group.

rpg,t3_a16gpz,"Using Background MusicHello. I wrote [this blog post](http://provintorpg.blogspot.com/2018/11/pavlovs-players-background-music.html). Shameless self-promotion.

Now that that's done: how do you use and/or categorize/organize background music? How do you think using background music in your games has affected them? How does your background music for games change when you change genres, or even campaigns within the same genre?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a16gpz/using_background_music/,"['Background music most definitely sets a mood. It can get people excited for the action, anxious about what horrors might be lurking, etc. *Star Wars* is probably the one that benefits the best, thanks to Williams iconic tracks, but even a good horror game can benefit from ""mood music"" (*Silent Hill*, anyone?).\n\nThat being said, I use it sparingly, and probably more than anyone else. It can become distracting, disruptive (if the track runs shorter than the scene/encounter), or even annoying (if the track just runs on repeat for too damn long).\n\nIn addition, I\'m Hard-of-Hearing, so I usually only use it to prep a game or a scene, before turning it off for the actual play. Otherwise, I mishear (or can\'t hear) my players, which just frustrates everyone.\n\nThe best way I\'ve seen it used in our latest (online) games is as soundtracks for the game, session, and/or characters. The GM plays something to get people in the mood, maybe do an intro over it, and characters get to use it as an intro for the campaign (or even session).', ""I love background music. I don't think the game's the same without it. I tend to buy full soundtracks and import them into MusicBee were I can change tracks easily, loop tracks, and even cut out parts I don't want in-app (like pesky vocal intros in otherwise immersing background tracks). I most just keep music categorised by album from which I pick what I want in the moment, but I also have a few combat playlists separate.\n\nI think music makes a big difference. It's the first step of immersion for my games and when it goes on, my players know to cut the chit-chat - we're ready to play.\n\nI always switch out my music based on the tone and aesthetic of the game. In the past I've used a lot from the Assassins Creed 3 OST in my revolution campaign. I've used a bunch of Baldur's Gate and Conan the Barbarian music in another game. We're heading into Ravenloft now where I've stocked up on Nox Arcana albums.\n\n"", ""I have very varying feelings about Background music. Tracks being too long/short for encounters always bothered me too much. Also  it makes communication at the table harder than it needs to be.\n\nHowever I also am very gamist in my way of playing and thus don't do many of the ambience stuff.\n\nI tried once to use the [Aural RPG Experience System](http://aresrpg.sourceforge.net/en/index.html) with very varying effect. It is absolutely stunning to sit in a room where you hear footsteps through the gravel/grass being surrounded by tweeting birds, and summing insects, then have the animals fade out and have slow rain effect starting interrupted by a BIG LOUD **THUNDERCLAP**.\n\nWhich really made the players feel like being surprised by the weather change. (as they were surprised by the ambient sound change). However building the sound library in ares was too much work."", ""I always use background music. All my games are location-based, so I pick out a track or two for every location. Sometimes important NPCs get a leitmotif, but I don't do that as often ever since I stopped prepping plots that relied on certain NPCs to survive.\n\nI usually use soundtracks from video games, mostly pre-2010s PC games because I've found they're the least likely to have other associations for my players. Video game soundtracks are the best for RPGs because they're intended to loop for long periods of time without distracting players, unlike film scores which are written or chosen to accompany specific scenes. I try not to use anything too recognizable, and I pick from sources with similar themes and aesthetics to the game I'm running. I also get some royalty-free tracks from [Incompetech](https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html).  For Call of Cthulhu, there are artists and groups that make music specifically for CoC games (Aklo, Cryo Chamber, etc.) so I use those too.\n"", ""So I've used background music for particular scenes I have in mind when running games on VTT. I never really used it much when I was running local games but I've been playing with a group for a few months that has a DM that is always using background music. I think it does take away since he only uses Youtube and runs into Ads every now and then, but when the music is not there....it feels so quite now (in a bad way) since I've gotten use to it. \n\nI think the next local game that I run will have background music in it. "", ""Using ambience like wind chine or rain also works very well in a horror game. \n\nAmbient music is great because it isnt distracting but reinforces a mood (as long as you dont play it too loud.\n\nAvoid video game music that people already are accustomed too cause it can break immersion and set the wrong mood because of their prior experiances.\n\nVideo game music does work well as long as it isnt clearly video game music. The Nier, Silent Hill, Shin megami tensei, and Shadow of the Colossus soundtracks are good examples.\n\nCeltic music is something that works well for D&amp;D without being too farmillar or distracting.\n\nYou can play music for certain scenes, but most of the time keep a well chosen playlist or track int the background.

rpg,t3_a15xqc,"On playing a lawful neutral character and other tipsBeen playing for some time a campaign that I really enjoy and I wanted to ask a couple of roleplaying questions.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I'm playing a kinda of lawful neutral character in a party of chaotic or just plain neutral guys. I don't want to be the one buzzkill and I don't want to intrude or limit player's agency. Any roleplaying tips?

Also, while I don't have what you'd call an opmized build, I do well in combat and, frankly, I love it. I'm the party's muscle, I love a good scrap. Sometimes, though, I feel I'm hogging all the attention and as much as I like fun I don't want to do that. Any tips about this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a15xqc/on_playing_a_lawful_neutral_character_and_other/,"['&gt;  I\'m playing a kinda of lawful neutral character in a party of chaotic or just plain neutral guys. I don\'t want to be the one buzzkill and I don\'t want to intrude or limit player\'s agency\n\nI mean you signed up for that by being Lawful. It\'s not a direct opposition for nothing. Expect subversion and pcs going behind your back to do things their way.\n\nMaybe roleplay a slide in alignment towards true neutral as you start thinking their ideologies are more and more reasonable?\n\n&gt; I feel I\'m hogging all the attention and as much as I like fun I don\'t want to do that. Any tips about this?\n\nI\'m assuming it\'s DnD that you\'re playing. The game is focused on combat, so if you\'re a combat drone then you\'ll be a major focus. But it\'s not inherently lawful to get into fights all the time, without a good reason. Even then if you feel like fighting you may start thinking ""Hmm, I wonder if my fellow party members may be able to get one up on these people without me beating their face in.""', ""As someone mentioned, Lawful Neutral doesn't mean you have to be all unmoving and oppositional. Your moral code can vary, it's just it's neither good nor bad, and how you enforce it may also be different.\n\nOne thing to consider is using mental gymnastics to find ways to accept your chaotic party's plans. It's not like people IRL don't do that every day, claiming one moral code while doing something opposite and then coming up with a reason they didn't violate their own tenets. :P"", 'I played a lawful good fighter for quite a while.  The party was diverse in its alignment and it never became a problem because we had goals that aligned.  \n\nBeing lawful doesn’t mean you have to obey the law. In game terms it means you have a code that you adhere to even when it is counter to your wellbeing.  For example, my character was a guard captain if a large city, my loyalties were to THAT city.  If our adventures took us to other cities, I didn’t care about the local laws if it was counter to helping my own city.', ""You don't have to play lawful neutral as a law-abiding, stick-up-your-ass character. You can simply have a personal moral code (not necessarily one that matches the law of the land either) that you follow strictly but don't force on others. Also, remember that actions dictate alignment, not the other way around. So act however makes sense for your character, and if that means gradually shifting towards another alignment, so be it."", 'You could interpret ""lawful"" as ""keeping your word"" and make it a character of honour and personal consistency. \n\nIf the group is chaotic-stupid, it\'ll cause problems either way though.']"

rpg,t3_a15tss,"Sword &amp; Scoundrel &amp; Modern FirearmsHi there,  


as some of you may have noticed already: Sword &amp; Scoundrel has been released by Grand Heresy Press and the PDF can now be downloaded on their page.  
[https://www.grandheresy.com/blog/2018/11/15/sword-amp-scoundrel-020](https://www.grandheresy.com/blog/2018/11/15/sword-amp-scoundrel-020)  


Sword &amp; Scoundrel is a game that is heavily inspired by The Riddle of Steel  (if you do not know TROS, use google or the reddit search) and thus combat is resolved on the basis of dice pools. I always liked this mechanic and wanted to use it for my modern age setting. Unfortunately this combat mechanic is mostly used for medieval fantasy or (in the case of SaS) early modern settings where modern firearms didn't exist. So I had to figure out something by myself. Here is what I came up with:

In the original rules of SaS you divide your dice pool into two segments. One is for Accuracy (dmg generation) and one is for Complexity (determine if you hit your target). If you wanted to make multiple shots (let's assume you want to shoot you double-barrelled shotgun) during your action you hade to divide your dice pool into two segments which had to be divided into Accuracy and Complexity each as well.  
Modern firearms, of course, can shoot many rounds in quick succession so I had to simulate this as well as the weapon recoil. My solution is the following:

Instead of splitting the whole dice pool into 4 or more segments we split the dice pool into Accuracy and Complexity and each successive shot after the first just splits the Complexity pool. In the original rules I don't see enough reason to take multiple shots in one round if you also risk to decrease your damage in addition to your potantial to hit something. This hack makes it quite understandable: You risk to hit your target properly but gain a damage advantage if you manage to hit. The reason to divide the Complexity pool and not the Accuracy pool is this: Accuracy is just your ability to hit something vital, Complexity is your ability to hit samething at all. 

An example:

Assume a big fella is approaching your character fast, in his hands a big sledgehammer, determined to beat the life out of you. Your character points their (I hope this is the correct gender neutral form, english is not my native language) gun on the fella and shoots 3 times.

Your Combat pool consists of 13d6. Every die that comes up as 3 or better is a hit. You need at least one success for your Accuracy roll, every successive die means more damage. For Complexity you need 2 successes each roll to hit your target. You allocate 5 dice to Accuracy and 3, 3, and 2 to each Complexity roll. Your dice come up the following: Accuracy: 6, 5, 4, 4, 2; Complexitiy Shot 1: 3, 3, 2; Complexity Shot 2: 6, 6, 2; Complexity Shot 3: 5, 4. The first shot misses the fella, the last two hit good and do 3 damage each, bringing the guy down.  


Of course the whole idea can be developed even further: Automatic Rifles can definitely shoot more rounds per action than a handgun. That is why I would recommend something like a threshold for each weapon that shows how many times it can be shot during the characters action. A threshold of 3 seems reasonable for handguns. Automatic weapons could even exceed that. If you wanted to go full Rambo and just spray your whole clip over the target you could easily pay a predefined number of dice, set up the requisited successes of the Complexity roll and add some damage to the outcome (this can surely be improved).  


What do you think? Do you have suggestions?  


&amp;#x200B;

  
",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a15tss/sword_scoundrel_modern_firearms/,"['Creator, here!\n\nThis is actually a fairly common point of discussion when people read the ranged combat rules. Something about it makes people think ""This would be awesome for modern gunfights."" Funny story about that? When the rules were first designed (ages ago) the first tests of the ranged combat system weren\'t renaissance-oriented at all. My then-coauthor hacked together a Fallout game out of our core rules and went to town. The ranged combat system was thus intended for modern firefights from day one. \n\nThe game has come a long way since then so I\'d dare not release the rules we were using then -- they are painfully fiddly by comparison to the system that exists now -- but it is definitely something we\'re going to be adding back at some point, either as a stand-alone hack or as part of a bigger project. \n\nInsofar as the implicit question of ""Why would you take multiple shots when MoS scales damage?"" There are a few situations where it\'s useful. The two most common are either when you\'re taking on multiple targets, or when your target is heavily armored. Multiple shots increase your likelihood of hitting a gap.\n\nAs for your stated question, the way we went about it then and the way we\'ll probably go about it in the future is actually to set up ranged maneuvers not unlike melee maneuvers. While a pistol firing individual shots might still be treated the way it is in S&amp;S core, something like ""Doubletap"" might expend an extra round in exchange for +1DR, or a 3-Round Burst might count as a single ""shot"" because of the maneuver, but you get 1d3 hits from it, and so on. You\'d need some tinkering to get the balance right, but it\'s going to be way easier than trying to juggle the dice and dealing with the damage loss from MoS. \n\nFinally: the game was updated today. Cheers!\nhttps://www.grandheresy.com/blog/2018/11/28/sword-amp-scoundrel-021-has-arrived ']"
rpg,t3_a15gle,"What are your thoughts on Degenesis?My friend just purchased the game and is planning to run it once he has a solid grasp on it.

Has anyone here played it? If so, what are your thoughts on it? Does it play similarly to D&amp;D or another popular game I may have heard of?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a15gle/what_are_your_thoughts_on_degenesis/,"['I have hosted a couple of sessions of Degenesis and own the core books and the Black Atlantic expansion. That said, so far I haven\'t played the published adventure, but instead multiple short self-contained sessions to get a feeling for the lore.\n\nDegenesis is hands-down my favorite Post Apocalyptic setting of all time. I love the amount of detail that went into worldbuilding and the absolutely staggering amount of time devoted to each of the thirteen cults and clans that make up Europe and Africa. The art is what you\'d expect from a professional concept-art studio and a joy to browse; I highly recommend purchasing the physical books if you can afford them, the art alone is worth it.\n\nThe system itself is pretty good. It\'s a dice pool system that combines your main stat (Strength, Charisma etc) and the relevant skill (shooting, brawling, negotiating, etc) to create a pool of dice that you roll. Each 4, 5 or 6 is considered a success and each 6 is a trigger, something like a critical success that amplifies how well you complete a challenge. This can be something as simple as more damage in battle to narrative advantages that you come up with on the fly.\n\nFor example, if my character wanted to use her revolver to hit a target, I would add my Dexterity (3 points) and Sharpshooting skill (2 points) together for a total of five dice. Then I grab those five dice, roll them and count all successes. If I exceed the threshold necessary to hit- usually 2- then my shot hits and I can add all triggers (dice that came up 6) as extra damage.\n\nIt\'s pretty simple once you get used to it and it feels satisfying to add dice instead of counting modifiers, but that\'s pretty subjective and might differ for you.\n\nWhat doesn\'t Degenesis do well?\n\nThe complexity is daunting. To get off your feet you have to learn the system and get a fundamental overview of each culture. The books don\'t waste any time diving deep into the lore like when it mentions the faction rank of each NPC like you know what that\'s supposed to mean in the beginning. Oh, this Chronicler is a Shutter? Well let me open up the other book and figure out what the hell that means.\n\nRules aren\'t all organized very well and can be scattered throughout the books. You definitely benefit from reading through the main rulebook Kartharsys several times to make sure you don\'t miss anything important like the salves that are tucked away in a sub-section.\n\nPersonally I found the bestiary lacking. They don\'t give you any stats for most monsters or people and instead tell you to come up with them yourself. After you\'ve done it a couple of times it\'s pretty easy, but honestly I wish they would give you a basic intro like Enemy Clanner 101. For this I highly recommend the community supplement [Degenesis Artifacts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6bE3C-eR4DHWTh6SXV1TDJiUUU/view).\n\nOverall, this is an excellent RPG and possibly the prettiest book ever made. I highly recommend this game for anyone that wants to play Post Apocalyptic, but I don\'t recommend it for one-shots or a ""hey let\'s try it out one time."" This RPG demands substantial buy-in and only gets better the more immersed you are with the lore.\n\n**Edit:** If you want some additional resources to help you out, there are a few links I\'d like to share:\n\n[Official Degenesis Character Sheet in English](http://sixmorevodka.com/degenesis/character-en/)\n\n[Official Degenesis Character Sheet in German](http://sixmorevodka.com/degenesis/character/)\n\n[Degenesis Cluster, a collection of useful functions such as name generators, randomizers and so forth](https://www.degenesis-cluster.com/)\n\n[Degenesis Icons, a collection of all established NPCs and their headshots](http://sixmorevodka.com/degenesis/icons/)\n\n[Degenesis Map Downloads and some extras](http://sixmorevodka.com/degenesis/downloads/)', ""I LOVE DEGENESIS.\n\nSeriously, though. D&amp;D has been my bread and butter since 2010 (D&amp;D 3.5e, Pathfinder, and 5e), so I am quite familiar with that system. Switching to Degenesis: Rebirth was like a breath of badly needed fresh air, so I would not equate it at all with D&amp;D. The stakes are so much higher. Your characters are, more or less, average people: you start out as nobodies with everything to prove. Because D&amp;D-like magic doesn't exist for player characters, you can't just take a risk knowing you have some tricks up your sleeve that can save your butt in a pinch.\n\nDegenesis: Rebirth really should be called Consequences: the Game. I go into every session with the thought, in the back of my mind, that my character could die that day. I have spent an entire session tense and shaking from the danger and death I was narrowly avoiding.\n\nAnd beyond that, the lore is fantastic, flavorful, and brutal. The art is gorgeous and paints such a vivid world that I want to explore it forever. It's dirty, it's cruel, and it's all about humanity eking out a living in the dark shadow at the end of the world – a beautiful trope, in my opinion.\n\nD&amp;D is a hero's whimsical fantasy.\n\nDegenesis is a survivor's calculated struggle to see the next dawn."", 'I\'ve been working my way through the first premade session and my play group loves it. The world feels so unique yet familiar since it\'s post apocalypse Europe/Africa.\n\nWe haven\'t done much combat so it could be that we just don\'t understand the rules well enough to play it efficiently, but that\'s the only part that went slowly. I love how you can combine skills to address situations that don\'t really fall into a single category. Cooperative actions similarly feel intuitive and rewarding. I\'m a fan of the system.\n\nIs it like other systems? Sure, but I don\'t think I\'d equate it to D&amp;D. Maybe Reign? I think it\'s way faster for my players, especially since counting low numbers is always faster than adding big numbers.\n\nOne notable comment one of my players made (currently in a murder mystery) is because magic isn\'t a thing (psychonauts excluded) it\'s way easier to make logical assumptions. How did the murderer get to his target can\'t be ""he teleported through the shadows"" and so you can keep your thought process more grounded.\n\nI highly recommend it - the art and world design is just dripping with imagination and the system feels simple enough to approach but with enough depth to handle whatever is thrown at it.', 'Since I found Degenesis Rebirth, I don’t want to play something else.\nIt has a super deep lore,\nvery fast forward rules \nAnd gorgeous art.\n\nIt feels from the beginning to the end like a system just for adults with all the bittersweet decisions you have to made.\nAnd there is no good, no evil.\nJust a big mass of grey.\nYour moral is the only compass you have to follow and you can be sure that all the consequences of your doings will hit you one day.\n\nThis isn’t a easy system for one shots or a quick peek. Not because of rules but because of the lore.\nBut if your a commit to it, you will have stories/ideas for ages with just the two core books.\nAnd you will reread the books once, twice and so on because you will find another puzzle for a new great story.\n\nAnd if this isn’t enough yet.\nYou can buy/ play the trilogy which has really heavy consequences on the entire setting.\n\nWell, Degenesis is fascinating, demanding and incredibly dense.', ""I have been playing DEGENESIS for the last two years, mostly as a GM, but also as a player for 6 months. \n\nIt is easily my favourite roleplaying game. The setting it extremely detailed, with a finely tuned metaplot that can give life to years of campaign without even forcing yourself. There is also a unique taste in DEGENESIS between the primal aspect of the game, and some cults that are close to being in medieval times, while other people are close to transhumanity and exploit this aspect of the universe. \n\nIt takes some time to get around the 700 pages of the two books, but once you're done with it, you already have a lot of things in your mind as every paragraph is a plot hook in essence - for a GM - or an idea for character creation - for a player -. \n\nI must also say that the developers are extremely close to the community, and therefore it gives this game a special flavour as anyone can get in touch with them, ask questions, obtain answers and maybe understand the universe a little bit better every day. \n\nWe also have the chance to have a great community that creates a ton of content - not as much as D&amp;D obviously but enough to give you an idea of what can be done in the universe if you are lacking some imagination at the beginning. \n\nAs for the setting itself. It is extremely grim, with a total absence of manicheism. Everyone is walking in an area of grey, without exception. \n\nYou will also be astonished by the quality of the art you will find in those books - which will give you a lot of ideas about how things look like, and what themes are common in this game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan't write much more because i'm on phone, but would be pleased to give you more insights if you have any questions ! :) \n\nAlso, I have played most of the sourcebooks/campaigns, and have created lines and lines of content accessible to everyone, so I will be glad to share this with anyone :) "", ""I absolutely love the setting. As a gamemaster I felt I had to deviate a fair bit from some things though. I was using the 1st edition of the rules and I hear they revamped quite a bit of stuff in future editions. The game lore for the classes makes it often feel illogical for your players to pick a real variety of classes. I remember the player's starting gear being absolutely bare bones and beefed that up a little. I definitely had some issues with the rules but it wasn't anything that couldn't be tweaked and the setting is soooo good and rich that it's worth it.\n\nIf the Degenesis crew reads this, pleeeeeease improve the YouTube actual play setup.

Nothing particularly unique, it\'s a dice pool system that runs perfectly alright in combat. It\'s really deadly, which isn\'t everyone\'s cup of tea (personally I like deadly games). \n\nThe real issues are in the organization and translation of the rules. There are a lot of things that need excessive cross-referencing and often are called different things in different parts of the book. \n\nThe clans aren\'t what you would call ""balanced"". Some have a ton of progression while others are a free ranks deep. Additionally there are a lot of them that straight up would not join up under any normal circumstances, which is a bit lame. \n\nThe translation really needed an editing pass by a native English speaker. Some of the words used are archaic or downright confusing, such as calling a watchtower a barbican in a sample adventure. \n\nOverall, it\'s a really cool setting and has great art, but I\'d prefer to run it in another system with some care taken to houserule some of the unclear aspects that arise due to the organization and translation.

', 'If anyone is interested in checking out the products on offer, just walk this way: https://shop.sixmorevodka.com/en/', ""I just wish this game was better known, you've probably seen all that pretty art and design that went into it, but where it really gets awesome is once you delve deep into its absolutely mind blowing lore. Perhaps this sounds like a downer, but have the DM read the books *at least once* from **cover to cover** and soak it all in, *taking as much time as necessary*. This is neutron star **DENSE** stuff we're talking about, packed with information, plot hooks and metaplot. It will take a while and your group will be thankful for it.\n\nPlayers should also have a look, at least into the introductory chapters of the lore book, the cults and cultures. The writing style might feel unorthodox at first but it will pique your interest as a living world and its mysteries develop in front of your eyes, adorned with lavish illustrations.\n\nAs far as I've played (being a DM), the rules are lightweight and serviceable, with the playstyle really favouring a narrative, cinematic style. I agree with other commenters that they're scattered all over the place, but they're simple enough to remember the core of it with the help of few aides for those special occasions. \n\nCombat is nasty and fast, don't expect a 200 turn long hitpoint scratch until one of the combatants finally dies. Take a shotgun shot and you might die the next turn. And of course it depends on your DM, but there is a strong focus on character development and conflict.\n\nThere was some hiatus after release and I think that's what made the game go under the radar, but the product line is nowadays more alive than ever, and the international community is thriving. Try the [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/degenesis.fans/) and ask some questions, they will get answered in no time, plus, the devs are active there, too! Fanmade content is on the rise, with adventures and [tools](https://www.degenesis-cluster.com) alike, all respecting the high quality standards.\n\nI'm perhaps a complete fanboy, but this is one of my favorite games and I can only end with congratulations to your group and prepare for a wild ride."", ""I've been GMing the game for about a year and a half now, give or take, and it's a pure underrated gem, probably one of the best RPG I've had the chance to master in my 20 years experience with this hobby.\n\nI won't linger too long on the art, it is absolutely stunning and by far one of the best out there in the RPG industry today, if not the best, but people went over it extensively already.\n\nThe rules are light, simple, easy to go through, somewhat intuitive and likable if you enjoy the trait+skill kind of system. Nothing revolutionary about them, but they do the job and allow for a certain flexibility through the combine rolls mechanic. The gear is equally simple but perhaps a bit too stretched across the rulebook, nothing you can't overcome but sometimes going back and forth to find all the specs of a given item can be somewhat tedious. Over time, as with any other game, you learn them and therefore this small inconvenience vanishes.\n\nRegarding your question about D&amp;D, I'd say that it has nothing to do with it aside from the fact that they're both RPGs. D&amp;D is a game system without any dedicated setting, whereas Degenesis is first and foremost a setting with a system designed to underline and mechanically support the discovery of said setting. And this is in my opinion where the game truly shines and sets itself apart from the crowd.\n\nThe setting is outstanding! It's raw, gritty, as anyone could expect from a post-apocalyptic setting, but it's not edgy for the sake of being edgy. Everything makes sense, within the lore, everything is consistent, to the point that it's almost frightening that such a huge and rich background manages to remain coherent despite the amount of lore written. Everything falls into place, it's a gigantic puzzle that may discourage a GM starting to absorb the game as it goes in 10 directions at once, but if said GM manages to take a step back and digest some of the essential information, the pieces assemble nicely and the overall tapestry is astonishing. The metaplot is heavy, brutal, fascinating, truly humane as there's nothing depicted here mankind wouldn't inflict upon itself, complex, intriguing, and yet surprisingly consistent.\n\nI stress this because we know many gales with rich backgrounds in the RPG business, but there's always a point where plotholes appear and only grow bigger with time. With Degenesis even the smallest detail is coherent and fits in the bigger picture.\n\nSo while the entry into the game is very demanding for the GM, it's also very comfortable for them to know that the overall plot makes sense and that his their players won't face a wall of suspension of disbelief because book 3 contradicts book 1. You may not understand nor figure everything out, but rest assured that it makes sense. The more you learn, and this game is truly a learning, almost initiating, experience for all those involved, the more it makes sense, the more enjoyable the experience is.\n\nAmong all the foggy and shady information of a well crafted scenario by Marko, nothing is more pleasing for a GM to see the spark of understanding lightening in the eyes of his players when they figure out the grand scheme of things and find a glimmer of hope in this dark and otherwise hopeless world. Truly a game worth buying and playing."", 'fucking great. especialy the crafting system.', ""Me and my group of 3 others have played Degenesis pretty much every Sunday for the past year and a half or so. We've played all three published adventures (in thy blood, the killing game and black atlantic), all of which are amazing experiences. Overall I would say Degenesis is my absolute favorite setting! The system leaves a little bit to be desired. But overall it's extremely good!\n\n  \n\nThe good and the bad  \n\nThere is a lot of reading to be done to truly understand all the cults and cultures and the interplay between them as well as the very deep meta plot.

FOR.\n\n  \n\nI would like to see a second edition of the rule system, aka, KatharSys. My largest gripe is that the Combat can sometimes feel a bit too luck based, often being decided within the first round if the players or enemies get extra actions by rolling multiple 6's on the initiative.  \n\nOther things that need revision are more cinematic combat encounters, killing enemies from stealth and things like that. But these can easily be house ruled.\n\n  \n\nLastly, Degenesis has a very small, but extremely passionate community. We hang out on a discord channel where we regularly discuss all kinds of things related to the game and setting and we even get to talk to the brilliant minds behind the game quite regularly in casual discussion.\n\n  \n\nTo answer your question, Degenesis is nothing like d&amp;d (in system or setting(LUCKILY!)).  \n\nThe closest that I have played would have to be nWoD I guess (system, definitely not setting)"", 'Degensis is amazing and evocative and the art by Marko is some of my favourite anywhere.\n\nA couple guys on our podcast played a session and recorded it.

Why?\n\nWell I (we, the group) tried, but for me, there is a crass disconnect between the presentation of the game by the books and HOW it actually plays. The rules (called Katharsys) incentivizes fast and hard skirmishes with a high lethality potential, for everyone involved. This means that PCs might die pretty easy - which by itself IS FINE. I enjoy gritty games with hard hitting consequences (and nothing hits harder than the death of your character) like DCC or any other OSR-type game. Now, every time I read through the chapters, I see this meticulously crafted world before my eyes. It\'s brimming with story vignettes, campaign ideas and other sources of inspiration that will keep you going for days, I’m sure.\n\nMy impression is, that Degenesis wants to be played in a long campaign format (which is further encouraged by the available adventure modules). This is where it\'s strengths in telling a story through exposure to the world really comes through. Therefore, I believe that a more lenient ""death"" system would be more beneficial to the overall experience of playing the game. It\'s also a bit confusing for me that the combat rules go in such detail, while the non-combat options are... well, sparse at best. Generally, the are a lot of ""blanks"" in the rules section (e.g. missing values, item descriptions) and the books are far from being optimized regarding the in-book navigation and referencing, imho. Further, the rules feel more like a necessity, nothing special at all.So.. functionally, it gets the job done. Somewhat. The setting is absolutely amazeballs, which makes it so frustrating for me, as there is enough inspiration out there in the ""indisphere"" for rpg rules design. Finally, there is a strong focus on a metaplot in between the adventure books, which I personally don’t like at all because it’s simply not my cup of tea.\n\nTo sum it up: It feels like Degenesis is at odds with its stunning presentation through art and fluff, and the game itself – the things we actualy do and experience in a gaming session. But, I do understand the burning zeal of its fans and I still will keep an eye on the upcoming products and books down the line.. maybe things will turn in a (for me) more pleasant direction.', ""I read it after I learned about my wife's pregnancy and I couldn't handle the talk about spore babies.

After a few decades of colonization, settlers discovered that they weren't the first to try and colonize it. And all previous aliens were either driven to extinction by the planets modified animal life, or simply vanished.  


The planet is named Nest, after the project to settle it. ""New Earth Settlement and Technology"" Initiative. (Or just Nest Initiative.) The name is a fun piece of old-school style naming which feels like it came from an old anime, or sci-fi novel.

&amp;#x200B;

It also works on a few symbolic levels, as the planet can be seen as humanities new nest, humanity can be seen as cuckoos in the nest, and that it's a nest for the mysterious beings that modified the world.

rpg,t3_a0yhyw,"Minigames - One vs. Many Dice/Card games suggestions?Hi!

I like to run ""mini-games"" in my DnD sessions, usually with simple or well known card/dice games. The biggest difficulty I've found is that most games become more or less trivial if 3 out of 4 players are teaming up to beat the 4th! Sometimes I provide incentive for the players to work against each other, but other times I really like that collaborative energy - I just want to make it more difficult for them, without resorting to any feel-bad sort of strategies (like 'the GM is allowed to cheat' haha)

So, any suggestions for games that are purposefully set up to be group vs. one? Ideally, games that are also relatively simple, and only require a standard deck of cards and/or dice?

Or suggestions for how to use more standard games without just creating reasons for the players to be working against each other?

rpg,t3_a0xuwh,"GMs, how do you handle 'easter egg' artifacts/items?bear with me, I'm not sure what else to call them.

suppose you have a tome. it may or may not be magical. but said tome, if studied for 2d4 months, grants a permanent ability score increase. it is a 'manual of wisdom' from a game mechanical perspective, but in-world it's a massive tome of, say, ethical philosophy.

As a GM, i don't want to describe it as ""a book, if you study it you get +1 WIS"". I want it to just be a book, and if the player decides his character reads it, I will one day say, ""hey you get +1 to your WIS."" And if they never study it, never show interest, they just miss out. 

But how do I convey to a player the *possibility* of its benefit? How do I pique their interest? this is a general problem with magic items as well. I don't want to just say, ""when you cast *identify* you learn that this is a *ring of protection +2*,"" because that's boring. It might be fine in a high-magic setting, but I prefer low-magic, gritty, where items are rare and wondrous.

Best be prepared to prove both, if you want to keep it for long.\n\n"", ""To turn /u/Waywardson74's excellent response into more general advice: If you want magic items to feel special, or significant give them some weight in the world.

Not compatible with SWN, but it has good ideas for passing generations and lots more. It's not marketed as such, but Dynasties is essentially a standalone game."", 'A few notable themes/ideas/mechanics within the Dune universe, if you\'re going for a similar feel:\n\n* Great Houses - This is easily handled using SWN\'s faction system. Major powers would work well as ""regional hegemons,"" and would include House Corrino (Imperial house), CHOAM, the Spacing Guild, and the Bene Gesserit. Most Great Houses would work well as ""planetary governments,"" such as House Atreides and House Harkonnen. Minor factions would include the Fremen. Great Houses would need to keep a pretty even balance of Force, Cunning, and Wealth, while other factions would put a much greater emphasis on Cunning (Bene Gesserit) or Wealth (CHOAM, Spacing Guild) and have few Force assets.\n* Holtzman Shields - This technology did a lot to add to the feel of Dune, often indirectly. While they spend little time on the tech itself, it does explain 1) why there\'s such a focus on dueling/melee combat among the nobility and their elite guard, and 2) the nature of warfare between the houses, and why trickery is often more effective than open warfare. If you want melee/duels to be a part of your setting, there needs to be an in-universe reason for it that makes sense (otherwise guns are just better). If not technology, another reason could be a cultural emphasis on duels among the nobility; it could even be a means of settling legal disputes (instead of lawyers, you keep expert duelists on the house payroll). \n* Mysticism - SWN\'s psionics system should handle this fine. Groups like the Bene Gesserit focus heavily on Precognition and Biopsionics. Mentats *might* work as Metapsionics, but the SWN version is much more powerful than what Mentats could accomplish in Dune. SWN has a Space Magic option in the full version, but that\'s getting out of Dune territory and into D&amp;D in space.\n* Spice - Can be substituted for just about any other MacGuffin that works for your setting. The key ingredients for this are: 1) must be rare/unique (limited supply); 2) must be difficult to obtain (easy to control distribution); and 3) must have some essential use so society can\'t just decide not to bother (in Dune, space travel is impossible without it). Control of the spice trade was one of the central conflicts throughout the Dune series. \n* Open Warfare - In Dune, Holtzman shields made conventional warfare significantly more difficult. Add the difficulty of transporting armies through space (the Spacing Guild can just say no), and planetary warfare becomes something that doesn\'t happen every day. And no space combat, because the Spacing Guild won\'t allow it - starships are too expensive, and Navigators are too valuable. How does your setting deal with this? By limiting open warfare (making it difficult/expensive), it makes small groups of highly trained operatives/agents (the PCs) the best option to handle most affairs, especially if it involves traveling offworld. If sending an army is too expensive or just not feasible, send the PCs.

After that, I started writing more notes and even talked to the player about that, since I was unsure of their motives.

Then, after a particular encounter, we made it back to town and slept in the inn. The DM then asked the whole group what we'd like to do for the following morning. One PC decided to go for a hunt, as they're the ranger and haven't been able to hunt for sport in a while, One PC decided to go to the church to investigate further the disappearance of the Raven Queen (long story), and the third decided to sleep in as she is want to do. So I decided to have a jewel I found inset into a locket I also found to create a memento of the story. However, I did this through notes since the other PCs wouldn't know this info (benign as it was). Afterward, the other PCs corner my PC, cast zone of truth, and make her spill her guts about what she's up to.\n\nUltimately we've all talked it out (out of game) and note passing will probably have to go away.

When I GM I try to make sure that everyone is on level with the mood/tone/general story structure of the game from the get go - I find this limits a lot of the silliness and gets people invested from the beginning. It's also totally cool to have these conversations post starting a campaign; I like to do post session check-ins, where you can say 'hey I liked how this part of the session went, I wasn't super into this part, next time do you think we can do more of this sort of thing?'. It can be hard to get in the habit of doing that, it feels very immersion breaky the first few times, but it really helps in the long run.\n\nBut even without that, I find that the silliness tends to decrease the longer a game runs. As people get attached to their characters or the story they tend to settle into it more, and in my experience a lot of the really over the top silliness comes from insecurity around the role playing - clowning it up because they're not sure exactly what they're doing. As they 'discover' their characters, and learn that taking it seriously won't get them laughed at (if that's actually the case... :/), then that tends to go down."", 'My GURPS post apocalypse game had a couple murderhobos for the first session or so.

A player group of wanted crooks hiding in the desert might not have much political intrigue going on. A group of players in the Royal Court deciding the future of the Kingdom, aren\'t going to have a lot of hack and slash action happening for the fighters. But it sounds more like your group has a diverse player group who don\'t have a unified goal or vision. It happens, Fantasy games tend to be more culprit in my experience. The Wizard wants to go craft magic items or study spells, the Bard wants to hang out at taverns and listen to rumors, the Thief wants to find a good score, the Barbarian wants to slay 50 goblins...if the players can\'t look past their ""vision of the character"" to cooperate with the group as a whole and if the GM doesn\'t present a larger goal ""Protect the Kingdom from the machinations of the Evil Necrodemon"" or whatever, then the group starts to fracture, tries to pull the GM and the player group in ten different directions.

&amp;#x200B;",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a0u3io/new_gm_running_for_a_big_group/,"['I think it is very difficult to get around the fact that 8 players are just too many, there are no great solutions to this problem as far as I know in a traditional RPG like the one you describe. You\'d be better off with two groups of 4, but I realize that may not be what you want to be doing.\n\nRegardless, some general advice for what you are asking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpeeding up combat:\n\n1. **Dont think on your turn.** Encourage your players to have their actions ready by their turn and to do their thinking on other people\'s turns. If people start going over their options trying to find an optimized combat action when their turn starts, you will never get done with anything. If people need more time to think, skip to the next person and come back to them when they had more time to make their decision.\n2. **Don\'t get the players bogged down in details or rules.** Don\'t get into the minutae of how the rules work for the action they are trying to do. Simply ask them ""What do you do?"" or ""What are you trying to accomplish? How do you do that?"". Have them tell you their characters action in-fiction, ask them for the appropriate roll and tell them the result. If you\'re unsure of a rule or the situation or rules are complex, simplify them. Pull something out of your ass. It\'s much more important that the game flows than that you follow the rulebook to the letter. Depending on the group or system, consider dropping any initiative system and just go around the table clockwise. (Assuming no one has really made initiative an important strength of their character). \n3. **Split up fights into more manageable parts.** Instead of an 8v9 fight with orcs, make seven 1v1s and one 1v2. Better yet, design combat with different compartments that interact. One team could be holding back the thugs, the rogues could be trying to sneak to backstab the opposing archers while the mages try to stop a magical trap from springing on them. It makes their experience more individual and satisfying. \n\nSpeeding up social encounters:\n\n1. **Only play scenes that have a point**, focus on that point and then wrap the scene when that objective is done. Blackmailing a dude for papers of passage? Do it and be done. Masquerade ball at the duke\'s castle? Show the important NPCs, let them gossip with the players, let the assassination attempt happen and give the players agency. Try to cut away travel, logistics about where to go, what to do, who to find etc. Players trying to figure out how to keep in touch in a world without cellphones can eat a whole session if you let it. Cut those scenes out and just assume your characters are competent and can handle it. \n2. **Wrap up in-group scenes.** If they have in-group planning sessions or sit around in a tavern deciding their next move, be very prepared to go ""So it sounds like you want to break in to the castle, is that right? Okay, so its the next night, you\'re stalking behind the barracks in dark clothes.""\n3. **Clarify confusing or pointless interactions.** In the same vein, if they are chatting with NPCs but it seems like they are going in circles or things are just unclear somehow, ask them ""What are you trying to accomplish?"" then frame the scene about them trying to manage that and then move on/finish up the scene.  \n\n\nGeneral group management advice:\n\n1. **Define a common group identity.** With 8 people and all of them new players, you just dont have time to deal with shit like ""It\'s not what my character would do"" or a chaotic thief messing with the lawful paladin. It will engage 2 people and have the other 6 sit and wait with building irritation. Everyone needs to have a common identity and be on board with the goal of that identity. Discuss it with your players and decide what that identity is, but demand there is one. They could be an adventurers guild, a gang of thugs or thieves, a company of mercenaries, a group who all swore vengeance on Witch Lord Xarxar, whatever. Give the group a name. Give them a crest. A flag. A motto. Whatever. Make them feel like a group. It also makes it easier to add new characters when old ones die, because the fiction of recruiting a new dude to the gang is easier than making a new friendship. \n2. **Communicate outside the game.** Literally everyone posts this all the time but all problems are solved by talking it out with players. Manage expectations. Clear the air from irritation. Set up clear expectations about times and places when you\'re going to play.\n3. **Understand your players.** Some people really love super crunchy combat, and you might have to let them go deep in the system instead of shortcut. Some people put a lot of energy into their backstory and maybe you want to give those backstories more screentime. Some people just want to hang out with their friends and have a good time. Understand them, their expectations, and find a game, characters, campaign and group dynamic that suits your group.\n\nGiving more importance to backstories:\n\n  \n1. **You can\'t do this with 8 distinct characters.** Assuming they are an average DnD party and have little backstory connection, I just dont think this works, time-wise. You can choose a few of them and bring them to the forefront and make the campaign about them, and have the other ones show up for interaction in side quests, but you just can\'t give equal time and spotlight to 8 backstories and have it be meaningful. Given that, here are a few optimistic ways to handle it better:\n\n2. **Give certain characters connected backstories and relations.** Maybe three of them are from that village that got burned down by the evil wizard instead of just one dude. Maybe one guy is a squire to another one. This gets easier with the common group identity, because then you can all be out to redeem your shame in exile from the king, but still have small flavor changes in how/why that happened and what the motivations are. That gives the group a backstory which is easier than juggling 8 different ones. \n\n3. **Make the campaign episodic.** Choose 1-3 backstories for this tiny arc of the campaign, play that for a couple of weeks, then move on to the next few characters. I don\'t really like doing this as it puts some character growth on pause, but it is a way to give everyone screentime in such a large group. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck.  \n\n\ntl:dr:  Ask ""What are you trying to accomplish?"" and cut to that.', 'I wouldn\'t run eight players in *any* system, and I\'ve been doing this for twenty years. As a first-timer, I\'m surprised you even lasted two sessions.\n\nIf it\'s at all possible, split them into two groups. Eight is just too many; you can\'t manage them all, and there\'s not enough spotlight time for anyone.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs far as interesting description and narration goes, it helps to have a mental image of what the action looks like. A goblin fights very differently from an ogre. A spearman fights very differently from a swordsman. A fight in a forest looks very different from one in a castle. Don\'t just quote mechanics at your players, describe the *scene*, be evocative.\n\n""The goblin attacks you, and... [rolls] hits, [rolls] five damage."" is boring\n\n""The goblin crouches low, circling toward your weak side slightly, then springs upward at you with a snarl, aiming a thrust of his rusty little blade at a gap in your plate just above your hip, and... [rolls] hits! You feel maille links break and the point of his dagger slice into you [rolls], deep enough to sting but not gut you. That\'s five damage."" is much more interesting.\n\nIf you don\'t already watch it, Matt Mercer of Critical Role is very good at this sort of evocative description.\n\nHere\'s a quick exercise to try: Take [this fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OkJumB_ehU&amp;ab_channel=OpenClips) and write a play-by-play description of it, as though you were narrating that action to your players. Don\'t just focus on the attacks and defenses, either; pay attention to the emotions, they\'re what really sells a scene. Brienne\'s mood goes from curious to annoyed to angry, while Arya goes from bored to interested to having fun. It also ceases to be a sparring match after Arya gets knocked over; at that point they\'re both legit going at it ""for reals"", right up until the last instant.', 'So, there are two super-important things you have to focus on with a group that big:\n\n**1) Not letting it get boring.** So, with a very tactical game and a lot of people, there is a looong delay from when I take my turn and when I take it again. This can lead to boredom and distraction. I have found that some of the things that help with this are counter-intuitive to what a lot of GMs prefer to do with their groups. For instance, encouraging table talk helps keep the players engaged. In other words, let the players work out what the best move is for player A. Many GMs balk at this as it give the players a huge tactical advantage that their characters wouldn\'t realistically have and feels like meta-gaming. BUT, it also keeps all the players engaged in the battle as they have a voice in what is happening and can add extra tidbits like, ""OK, if you move there, I can\'t cast fireball"" and that sort of thing. The same is true when confronting traps or other complex problems. I let them work it out together and that helps keep the whole group engaged in the problem.\n\n2) Making sure everyone gets to do stuff. With that many players, some problems will be solved before a player even gets a chance to try to work on it. Also, it is a lot easier for one player to sort of over-shadow the group and other players to not get much attention. I try to fix this by making sure that each player gets a turn to act. When it is time for Player B to do their thing, I wait for them to come up with something. Again, this is counter-intuitive to what many GMs want to do. I have even heard of GMs who use a chess timer or otherwise limit how long a player can think before they take an action. This doesn\'t work for large groups. While it can theoretically help with pacing, it can undermine efforts players might be making to pursue their own goals in your game world. Also, it isn\'t fair to players who just need a moment to think or aren\'t very good at spontaneous creativity. So, just let them know this is their one chance to do a cool thing and wait for them to come up with a thing to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been running many systems for a 7-10 player group for years. Let me know if you have any specific questions.', ""A way to speed up combat is to stick with average damage for everyone did they don't have to take the time to roll damage and then do the math.  Habe then write down on their sheets average damage and crit damage.  This speeds things up a lot."", ""That is too many players especially for a new DM. I'd suggest new DMs run no more than 4 players usually. "", 'For Handling Large Groups: \n\n1. If the PCs split the group, lets say 3 players want to go off together and do something, have them sit in the next room, you can get to them when you resolve what the rest of the group is doing. \'\n2. Switch back and forth between PCs or different groups taking seperate actions frequently. Right in the middle of when one PC is starting a fight with a guard while sneaking off on their own, you switch back to the Wizard talking with the local Ruler. Then you switch to the Thief robbing him in the tower. Don\'t be afraid to pause the action and give each player their turn so they don\'t feel left out.\n3. Don\'t get pulled into rules debates with one PC when there are 7 others waiting to play, make a GM arbitration and move on. \n4. Do a ""Star Wipe"" or ""Fade to Black"" during time consuming scenes where nothing is really going on, the PCs are looting every badguy in the ruined castle? Just say it happens and move to the next scene, resolve the laundry list of loot later, for now its packed on a wagon or something. Skip through drawn out travel scenes and get to the action. \n\nFor Handling Social Scenes: \n\n1. Make sure every character who wants to participate can do so, switch back and forth frequently. \n2. Don\'t let one player dominate the talks too long or go off on long speeches, cut them short and get to someone else. \n3. Have stuff happening in the background for the other players to notice or react to, the negotiators are busy so they don\'t get to roll Awareness for the assassins sneaking in the window, only the quiet PC who has been sitting and eating the whole time gets to notice them. etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you find combat is taking too long there are a couple tricks to speed it up:\n\n1. The NPCs and Monsters can be cowardly, maybe they run away if they\'ve taken too many losses. \n2. Give the PCs overwhelming opposistion and make them run away or risk certain death. (If this is a D&amp;D type game, up the CR to something unreasonable for the group and have it give someone a solid scary hit until they get the hint).\n3. If the enemies are intelligent or human, have them stop the combat and parlay, offer to change sides, appeal to the PCs and maybe even offer to help if they have a counteroffer. Then it becomes a dialogue scene instead of one long combat, even if negoatiations fail, you\'ve made a break in the action. \n4. Streamline large combats or narrow in on what the PCs are doing only, resolve fights happening in the background with simple opposing die rolls (I just add a bonus equal to the strength or numbers of one side vs. the other). \n5. Interrupt the fight with something that can\'t be ignored. Are you going to keep fighting in the dungeon now that the corridor is slowly flooding with Lava? Don\'t be afraid to rip up the terrain or make the environment hazardous for prolonged battles. ', 'When half the party are busy and don\'t have anything to do you could have the inactive players choosing what equipment or skills they want to buy (That has the benefit of also keeping them quiet, although they may have questions for you), or working on a problem coming up, such as the plan of how to infiltrate somewhere. \n\nIf the player you are talking to is being indecisive about what they want to do, say ""Have a think and I\'ll come back to you on this"". The same applies if they\'re not focussing on their own turn, getting distracted.\n\nIf someone is wandering off topic, getting distracted from the game you can suddenly put the focus on them with immediate danger to get their attention. \n""Tom, While you\'re lazing in the sunshine a shadow falls over you. Something is poked hard into your belly. A tall man has a sword aimed at your gut. ""Get up!"" he says. \n\nOne tip that works well in fast paced games like Cyberpunk is the ticking clock or egg timer hour glass on the table. It keeps things moving when everyone\'s still dithering too long in the middle of a dangerous situation. \n\nRole-players can sometimes get more irritable and aggressive in combat scenes when the adrenaline is flowing. They may visualise the situation differently, so clearly establish things like available cover, the terrain, where everyone is in relation to one another, exits etc with quick diagrams, miniatures or whatever. With a group that size not everyone will have a clear view. We\'ve even used whiteboards before now.  \n\nGM Screens can have useful quick stats on them. Book mark your most useful pages and pre-prepare. If you\'ve got someone in the group who really loves the mechanics it could be an asset.  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n', 'The solution to a group with eight players is to run two groups with four players each.']"

Cause that article makes no sense without context. Was expecting further paragraphs below the pictures...but nothing. ', '  \nEdit: Looking back, I realize how I\'m painting with really broad strokes... I wish I knew enough to go into more detail. I walk away from this feeling like I haven\'t done either side justice, only like I\'ve vaguely pointed at one of the central issues. And what\'s more, I erroneously described Necropraxis as being ""firmly on one side,"" making an over-reaching assumption. In re-reading the post, it\'s clear to me that he\'s only saying he wants the OSR label to remain in general use so that it can help newcomers, and he\'s against social coercion for a good cause, even if its unintentional, but especially if its for ulterior motives (higher sales). That\'s quite a bit limited compared to what I originally said. Also note, there\'s also more to Stuart Robertson\'s recent saga.\n\n \n\nI\'m not nearly informed enough to make a final judgment on the conflicts (drama) in the OSR, but I know enough to give some context.\n\nOne the conflicts, what seems to be the central one to this article by necropraxis, is whether political and social issues should be left out of gaming (""can\'t we all just check the baggage at the door and game together?""), or whether political and social issues are too important to be ignored, even in gaming, (""No, I\'m not going to support that cause, and by extension that person supporting that cause, even by association, and certainly not by my money."")\n\nThis is a moral quandry. Your judgment on the issue will depend on what you think is actually going on and your philosophical ethical framework for judging such matters. (What level of association or support is acceptable or reprehensible? When is censuring, or even censoring, not only permissible, but morally necessary? Where does freedom of speech and freedom of association begin and end? Are some strategies for social change more effective than others? Or does that even matter, if you don\'t think the ends justify the means?)\n\nStuart Robertson, designer and copyright owner of the most famous and common OSR logo, has said: ""I am no longer permitting anyone to use the ~~#~~**osr** logo if they publish material that is harassing or hateful towards women, LGBT+ or ethnic/religious minorities. The old school ~~#~~**dnd** community is for everyone."" Some have interpreted this to mean that the OSR is being fractured between these two groups, that the side that is vocal on social and political issues (or at least Stuart Robertson) is trying to ""steal"" the whole OSR label for their side. (Robertson\'s Twitter statement: [https://twitter.com/stuartdraws/status/1063235167265935360](https://twitter.com/stuartdraws/status/1063235167265935360) )\n\nNecropraxis is ~~firmly~~  (***generally? possibly? slightly?***) on the side that says the politics and social stances of players and creators should be left out of the game, so long as the political/social statements they make is left out of their games/content, or even if they are, ""just don\'t buy it."". (I\'m sure many in the camp ***(including Necropraxis himself)*** are themselves against misogyny, racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. But such individuals do exist, otherwise this wouldn\'t be a problem in the first place). Necropraxis has attributed ulterior motives to ***some of those who ostracize/boycott for social causes*** ~~the socially vocal~~ : ""Rather than helping a marginalized group or suffering individual, polarization weaponizes substantive political concerns to sow divisions and play status games, sometimes to bolster egos, sometimes to build name recognition in service of selling products."" Perhaps his cynicism is justified in some cases, but I think he casts aspersions far too wide.\n\nThe ""social justice"" side is probably fully aware that the conflict (the ""drama"" or ""polarization"") makes it more difficult for newcomers to discover the wonderful aspects of the OSR. Nevertheless, they would argue, it\'s more important to deal with the hatred and phobias despite the cost, and on the other hand it will actually make OSR more accessible to those who are targeted by hate speech.\n\nI\'m not saying which side is right or wrong (I don\'t know myself). But there are voices on both sides, perhaps shrill minorities, that have logical fallacies in their arguments, are not communicating their side well, and/or are assuming the worst of their opponents without truly understanding and empathizing with their positions.', 'The term \'OSR\' is kind of a misnomer because 1) 70s/80s style never went away, and 2) This so-called \'revival\' has been around as long as B/X was out up until the OGL release. We\'re almost coming up on two decades of OSR, but it\'s now a label that has stuck and describes a philosophy and style. Fine with that.\n\nI\'m also happy OSR is around because it\'s a helpful way to organize people who like a certain style of fantasy RPG play. Also, if OSR and certain logos are a convenient way for LGBTQ folks to find a friendly game to play in, more power to them. And I think the OSR movement has empowered lots of self-publishers and would-be designers who may not have had the community to support them before. Totally cool. More and different people engaging with the hobby is a good thing in my book.\n\nWhat I\'m a bit tired of is the claim by some that OSR is somehow ""better"" or ""revolutionizing"" the hobby. There\'s an air of condescension in *some* conversations surrounding this movement that I don\'t like. It seems a touch smug to declare you only play OSR stuff. It\'s similar to when people need to let you know they only listen to obscure indie bands you\'ve never heard of.  Sometimes it\'s OK to listen to Led Zeppelin and sometimes it\'s OK to play 4e.', ""Is it good though?\n\nThe OSR label helped that particular person out in finding that style of game they like. I'm sure the drama surrounding the label would turn away just as many players when they googled it.\n\nI think subdividing a hobby like this only serves to draw a line of distinction and create and us and them mentality. Look at people that play video games, there is a lot of nonsense about PC-gamers VS console gamers that serves no real purpose beyond creating sides to a debate that shouldn't really exist. At the core of it they are both just playing video games. I'd recommend Dr Suess's the Butter Battle Book for further examples of why categorizing these extremely similar things doesn't really help anyone.\n\nOSR, story games, tactical games, etc are all RPGs. I think trying so hard to separate them into distinct subdivisions is really what drives all of these arguments. Why not focus on what each game is about? Leave the mechanics out of it until the people who want to play take a look at what's under the hood. Instead focus on establishing a clear objective that the rules are designed to support. This works especially well to avoid the struggle of categorical definition and eliminates the debate over whether something qualifies to be labeled as whatever whoever is trying to label it."", 'Regarding the ""drama""...

The early roleplaying scene in Sweden was dominated by a fantasy game called Drakar och Demoner, which was more or less a clone of Runequest, with a Dungeons and Dragons inspired name.

Fanhunter (a parodic distopic game based on a comic of the same name) was quite huge for a time, but I\'ve not heard anything about it for a while.\n\nHowever, there\'s quite a lot of production, with several ""huge"" companies churning out both translations and Spanish creations quite regularly.', ""I'm Japanese.\n\nIn addition to Call of Cthulu, which has already been mentioned, systems like Shinobigami and Sword World 2.0 are popular. \n\nThere was a big boom in trpg replay videos that raised the hobby from obscurity to a relatively prominent subculture, though that's slowed down a bit.

All of these are translated into German and have a vast offering of books.\n\nCrowdfunding is also big, but mainly to finance translations of US-systems like FATE, Savage Worlds or Numenera.\n\nThere is a genuine lack of new native German content. The last big thing I saw was DeGenesis (a nice post-apocalyptic game with space fungus), which is already quite old. My guess here is that the market fractured to much to support content producers; there is just not enough money around for small products.

rpg,t3_a0t3lc,"Has anyone here GMed an Odyssey or ""The Warriors"" (film)-like campaign? If so, or even if not, I am in dire need of some advice!Hello,

In the near future I'm going to be running a campaign in a space fantasy setting of mine.

The campaign itself is about the players being a part of the crew aboard a military warship. The lone survivor of a fleet after a fierce battle deep in enemy territory. So now the campaign follows the ship (The CRN Nightjar) and its crew as they embark on the long and dangerous voyage back through enemy space in order to get home.

My issue is that because the party aren't part of the captain and high ranking officers aboard the ship, I'm needing to figure out ways to keep them engaged and have agency. The main way I'm doing this right now is to have the party be a part of some sort of ""designated away team"", being the ones sent out of the ship on missions. So even though the party aren't exactly the ones deciding where the ship goes and such, they do have some sway.

I'm also looking for advice on missions that the party can be sent on. So far these are my main ideas:

- Being sent in secret to infiltrate and either take down or simply sabotage and enemy outpost so they can't alert enemy warship to the fact that the ship is travelling through the area

- Being sent to steal supplies from an enemy depot/convoy. As the ship will need things such as  water, food, medicine and even ammunition for its cannons

- Being sent down planetside incognito to blend in with the population and work out a way to obtain supplies for the ship. Ranging from the things mentioned above, or even a new power core. With this, I expect to send the party on side-missions to gain the trust of people and whatnot

I have also had the idea of the party eventually building up a small ""fleet"" over time, Battlestar Galactica style. From prisoners and POWs and the ships that they liberate

It should also be noted that the ship, the Nightjar, is lightly armed and armoured but designed for speed. This will factor in to the logic and thinking of both the party and the captain. Since the Nightjar can't afford to get into a battle with more than one warship, and its best tactic is to run and out-manoeuvre the enemy

However, I'm worried this isn't enough. I could sincerely do with advice on missions for the players, and ways of keeping them engaged and having agency in the story itself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a0t3lc/has_anyone_here_gmed_an_odyssey_or_the_warriors/,"['A few ideas to mull over...\n1. [Cue Metal Gear Solid ""You\'ve been spotted"" sound] A larger enemy Warship inbound. The players vessel must flee under fire. Luckily there is a nearby asteroid field and the enemy warship is to large to follow giving the player vessel time to repair before escaping. Wait, are they sending deep space assault teams to infiltrate our hull? A battle on the outside hull among the dangerous tumbling asteroids!\n2. Have a large enemy ship doggedly pursue them. Just when they think the enemy has lost them they come hot on their heels. Maybe at team needs to indigestible and disable the enemy ship.\n3. An indispensable part of the ship needs replacing (maybe oxygen/or water filtration system). Out here there is only two options. A Dytrine Shipyard (scavengers) may be their only option for replacement. Does the enemy tank them down? Will they be forced to return to the graveyard of ships resulting from their factions victory?\n4. Explore a derelict mining facility for supplies. Why was this abandoned? Or was it?\nHope you get some use out of those. Good luck!', ""Your premise rings similar to the Lost Fleet book series, except in that case it's a whole fleet rather than a single ship. That being said, you hit the main points. Raiding for supplies, liberating POWs. In that series they also discover a lot of critical intel due to being in enemy territory, which lends greater weight to their need to get home. Losing one ship might not matter to the war, but if they carry war-winning intel they HAVE to get it back to their own people. If you've got the time to check out the series I recommend it, it might give you some good ideas for the kinds of traps, pitfalls and twists your players could encounter. Some examples include:\n\n* Liberating a POW camp, camp is booby trapped with mines to kill the POWs if anyone tries to lift them out, but you only find that out AFTER taking the camp. Do you abandon the POWs, or try to find a way to disarm the mines and get them out? Be quick, enemy reinforcements are approaching fast! Your players are in command of the landing force and have to make the call.\n* Extorting supplies from a hostile facility, merchant ships carrying said supplies turn out to be booby traps crewed with fanatics on a suicide mission. Your players are aboard already leading the boarding action, do they retreat now and abandon the supplies or try to secure them before the crew can blow their ships?\n* Opportunity to destroy a critical enemy shipyard. Doing so means going DEEPER into enemy territory. Take the risk to cripple the enemy's capacity to make war? And if they do, would the sudden change of direction throw off pursuit or lead them into a trap? Your players could be sent to sabotage a key facility in the shipyards, the entire operation may hinge on their success.\n* Passing an abandoned colony, where the last few survivors are desperately broadcasting for rescue as their last life support equipment dies. All evidence indicates no other ships have been this way in decades, and no others will pass to rescue them. Does the crew risk capture to save these enemy civilians, or leave them to a slow death as their air runs out? Your players could be sent down to oversee loading the civilians, making sure they're not armed, but the civilians are desperate and starting to panic. Can they control the crowd and manage a safe evacuation, or will things get violent?\n\nAs your players aren't in charge of the ship, they might not have control over what the ship does in these scenarios, but they might be tasked with pulling some of them off. I've tried to include possible player involvement to the scenarios I listed."", 'Check classical d6 Star Wars books from ""The Darkstryder campaign"". A starship where players had three characters: one one member of the staff, one experienced crew member and a freshly created character.\n\nOverall an excellent blend, because each player always had something to do on any mission with at least one character. And it allowed room for some history-oriented drama from the main cast as well as character development for the rest.\n\nIt is hard to play with a large amount of players. I had up to 8-9, meaning over 25 characters to track. But over the year we played we had great fun. It can be an excellent source for ideas for what you want to do.', ""You can get a lot of mileage out of going planetside. My only advice is break it up with situations on the ship. Mutinees, defectors, spies, disease, fires, etc.\n\nDon't fall into a rythm of planet-ship event-planet-ship event, because that gets predictable and stale."", 'Let them play two characters.  \n\n\nFirst, their shore/boarding/damage control party, with stats and character sheets and rules.  \n\n\nSecond, the Captain, Executive Officer, Operations Officer, Chief Engineer, Medical Officer, Major of Marines, the Intelligence Officer, the Ambassador, or whomever you have as high ranking characters. No stats. No character sheets, other than some role-playing notes. Every session give them a short ""Captain\'s Briefing"" scene. Introduce choices. A long warp to Rando IV, arriving with almost no fuel but certainly ahead of the pursuers, or a diversion to Depot Station, where stellar cubes and space fuel, and whatever can gathered but it most certainly will mean being very close to being over-taken.', 'Another way they can gain more agency and authority within the ship is by gaining the captain and other high ranking officers trust.  Whether it be saving their life, which will probably happen more often than not, or just proving themselves to be invaluable on the ship.  Such actions could lead to promotions within the ships crew.\n\nYou could even set up for a mutiny lead by the party.  Obviously make the captain appear to be getting more and more incompetent as the campaign goes on where the other crew gets restless and starts whispering of mutiny, and if the party has done enough to gain the crews favor they could hint that this group of competent adventurers should take command.', ""Maybe some survival vs. morality missions? \n\nYour ship is detected by a space station and the PC team is sent to investigate. They find the station full of civilians and children. The station has already sent an alert to the authorities but if you blow up the station the authorities won't be able to obtain the civilian's statements/data.\n\nYour PCs find a colony on a frozen world abandoned by the authorities. The PCs have to choose whether or not to assist the colony with supplies/their ship's power plant while risking being detected or leaving them to starve."", ""Taking from another guy's idea...\n\nMaybe they are intelligence officers in some way, or one of them is a ship's political officer of a lower rank, plants by the government's spy agency, etc. It's a lot more Soviet but it could also be why they have some agency."", ""Huh.\n\nYou know, I never clicked/realised that The Warriors was a retelling of The Odyssey. We get used to seeing retellings of old stories (West Side Story, Cruel Intentions, et al) but this one totally escaped me (And I loved The Warriors).\n\nMonique thinks I'm dumb. "", 'I love this idea, I feel like ""Watch Battlestar Galactica a bunch"" isn\'t great advice, but you might also give the PCs some shuttles or fighter craft so that they can make an impact in starship combat. If the PCs weren\'t built to be pilots, make the previous pilots get killed and then have them get trained for the job because they need replacements on the crew. There is some inspiration from the ST: Voyager series too I imagine, they constantly lose crew and don\'t have replacements, so crew has to train for jobs they aren\'t used to doing. ', 'This is a great campaign idea. Reposting here for visibility. \n\nA couple of other ideas for missions could be;\n\n**Strangers in a Strange Land**\n\nIn search of materials crucial to repairs and on-going operations, the Nightjar discovers a stash among the ruined wastelands of a colony world that fell victim to a particularly devastating orbital bombardment campaign. No one is quite sure which side initiated this atrocity, but for those few survivors planetside it doesn\'t really seem to matter much.\n\nDuring an expedition to salvage the supply stash, the team encounters what they believe could be a scout or.. just an unlucky survivor who happened to stumble upon them. Either way the stranger escapes and the players either have to give chase or risk the Nightjar\'s approximate location becoming known.\n\nThe chase itself takes the Players through the burned out country-side and into ruined remains of a megalopolis all the while dormant security drones hone in on their location with deadly intent. To make matters worse, radio/communications is blacked out due to automated defense systems still jamming the airwaves long after the world has turned to ash.\n\nThe drones in this scenario are working purely autonomously and can only coordinate efforts if they are in line of sight of each other (allowing players to pick them off stealthily if need be). The stranger was a scout for the enemy faction whom just happened to be right place when the bombs fell. After witnessing said atrocities first hand, they lost their taste for war and instead are amenable to helping out the players if he/she feels they can be trusted. Can become a recurring NPC later who can give them some insights into how the enemy operates in a special forces capacity.\n\n**Deal Gone Wrong**\n\nThe Nightjar, on it\'s path home, must cross a stretch of space that is heavily patrolled by enemy forces. If discovered, the crew isn\'t sure that even the quick and agile ship could outrun these pursuers without suffering heavy casualties. The players are sent to Carmine Station, a trade hub for the sector, to see if they can ascertain information on enemy patrols and troop movements in the immediate subsector from a local crimelord who is also an information broker for the player\'s faction.\n\nTo assist with this operation, the players are met at the station by a friendly Intelligence Agent who has been embedded here for too long and seems to know the lay of the land. The agent provides the players with a safehouse and arranges a meeting with the Crimelord.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Agent and the Players at that time however is that the Crimelord is compromised. Enemy Security Services are monitoring the Crimelord\'s activities and if he is making a deal that seems of interest to them (such as buying intel for a surviving enemy ship asset for instance) they will move in and attempt a capture.\n\nDuring the deal, the Crimelord who has a good relationship with the Intel Agent will begin to seemingly make small talk. If the players are paying attention, they will note that the Crimelord is weaving codewords into this conversation that are meant to signal them of their impending danger. Regardless of if the players pick up on this, the intel they receive is accurate enough to allow the Nightjar a reasonable chance of making it through the area undetected.\n\nWith the deal complete, the Players must now contend with local Security Services who will attempt to ambush them with the intent of capture. If capture fails, they will not hesitate to utilize deadly force. To compound matters further, the ship they arrived on was impounded after the Security Services learned of their identities.\n\nIf the players are captured, the Intel Agent with the assistance of the Crimelord\'s professional killers will mount a rescue operation to retrieve the surviving players either as an ambush of the security vehicle of an outright assault on the security station the players are kept in.\n\nThe Intel Agent has a bug-out plan that he activates for the players. This may require a running gun-battle and car-chase through the city along with a harrowing EVA to reach a small mercenary stealth ship that is awaiting the players outside of the station.\n\nIf the Intel Agent\'s identity hasn\'t had their cover blown during the course of this adventure, they will opt to stay at the station and continue their diligent work. If the players recognize that the crimelord was alerting them and offer them a way out, the Crimelord and some of his loyal troops will join with the Players to help fight their way off the station. This new mini-faction has contacts all over the sector and has a variety of urban survival skills that can be put to use.\n\n**Power Games**\n\nDuring a refueling operation in the upper atmosphere of a Jovian planet (which helps conceal the Nightjar) the ship encounters an enemy military vessel apparently designed for special operations. Instead of outright open firing however, the ship hails the Nightjar in an unusual display of cordiality. The Commander of the vessel is a Prince within the enemy faction.\n\nHe explains he is here to take back his bride-to-be, a Princess whom was kidnapped against her will to be forcefully married to another Noble Merchant Clan. This will involve an assault on a moderately fortified installation and he won\'t be able to handle this on his own. However, with the assistance of the Nightjar...\n\nThe Prince offers the Nightjar safe passage and supplies through his domain if they agree to help. The Commander of the Nightjar would put this to a vote. If they succeed, they may have bought safe passage and a place to rest/repair behind enemy lines (that is if the Prince keeps his word).\n\nIf the Nightjar votes to not assist the Prince, the Prince will simply ask the Nightjar to finish what it was doing and move on (The Prince doesn\'t want to waste time or resources on the players at this time but may come back later with a vengeance).\n\nIf they vote to help the Prince, the assault will be fairly straightforward and will require some planning. The Prince\'s plan is to have the Nightjar act as a distraction while a team infiltrates the installation and rescue the princess (the prince will refuse to go on said operation himself). The Commander of the Nightjar will agree to this plan, but only if he/she has a team on the ground to accompany the Prince\'s team.\n\nThe players will be there to provide support to the Prince\'s Special Operators. This is both a show of support to the Prince (who may become a powerful patron to the Nightjar) and to provide some ""insurance"". The players are secretly notified that if they get word from the Nightjar that things have gone south, they are to kill the Prince\'s team and capture the princess.\n\nDuring the assault, the Nightjar sustains moderate but repairable damage. All the while, the Players and the Prince\'s Men engage with the Installation\'s Ground Forces. After a fierce but brief battle, both teams converge on the Princess.\n\nThe Princess is grateful for the rescue, however she makes it abundantly clear that she does not want to be married to either of the Princes (who turn out to be brothers with different last names!). Instead, she asks the Players to rescue her and for the Nightjar to provide safe passage to her and her entourage back to her homeworld where she promises them safe harbor (and resources).\n\nThe players have a choice, each with upsides and downsides. Either way, they will have two enemies (and a possible immediate fight on their hands) at the end of it and safe area for repairs. They could even be provided with the opportunity to work as privateers against other internal factions within the Enemy Nation (a move that would be applauded by their own side\'s intelligence services and could show cracks of a brewing civil war within the enemy nation).\n', ""The Warriors is based on Xenophon's Anabasis in which Greek Mercenaries find themselves stuck deep in enemy territory after the prince who hired them is killed after a successful battle. To make matters worse, their senior leadership is then wiped out by treachery.\n\nThe Hoplites the fight their way out of enemy territory and find their way back home. It is a short book and very important to the history of democracy, given how they made their decisions.\n\nThe only advantage the greeks had was their fighting ability and cohesiveness. They could not be defeated directly by a similar sized force in the area where they were stranded. This is the usual advantage that PCs enjoy, so that's nothing new.\n\nWhat makes an Anabasis style campaign interesting is that is about endurance and adaptability rather than pure power. The enemy knew that a head on attack on the Greeks would be costly at best, so they just cut off supplies and harried them with faster troops to keep them tired and starve them out while they gathered a bigger force.\n\nThe Greeks voted to march to the eastern Greek colonies on the Black sea, IIRC, hoping that the less predictable path would work in their favour.\n\nThe problems that they faced were logistical, cultural, and internal. They had to forage, fight, and make deals for food often blundering into situations that were way out of their experience. All the while the enemy chased them and harried them, trying to weaken them and prevent them from setting up somewhere. All the while there is a constant wheeling and dealing between the captains to keep the army together and keep moving.\n\nSo the obstacles that your players face are morale, supplies (food, fuel, shelter), hostile terrain and route finding, exploration and the unknown, as well as constant hit and run attacks to prod them. They solved their problems as much through diplomacy and cunning as through force."", ""For planetside stuff, Stargate Universe is a good example to draw from for ideas, as the entire premise is the gate opens when the ship needs something from the planet they are passing.  \n\n\nHowever, planetside stuff isn't the only thing that PCs can engage with. Most of Battlestar Galactica was about the relationships of the people on the ships, and the events that came about because of their maneuvering. I would say the best thing would be to mix planetside stuff with on-the-ship stuff to keep things fresh. Personally, I think that as they get more valuable to the ship (reliably capturing supplies and ships, freeing POWS, etc) definitely let the players take more responsibility for the ship. If you give them that feeling of progressing up the ladder and gaining more responsibility, they will probably engage more with the other crew members and be invested in the game more."", ""Just reading this got me pretty excited about the idea of them capturing an enemy ship on planet maybe even after there own shuttle or whatever vessel is taking them down to planet is damaged.

rpg,t3_a0rsbp,"I need solo and one on one adviceBasically every time i tried to have a group to play with it normally ended up in a disaster and a big part of that is that i live in the uae where rpgs aren't as big as other countries and that's saying something and sadly both of my friends had to leave the country and my timezone limits the amount of players so I've decided to ether do a one on one with this play I've found or if he says no then i would do a solo. 

So here's some things i need to know. 

What game are good for 1 on 1 I've heard of beast hunter's and scarlet heros and burning wheels and i hear dnd and path/starfinder both are workable and Chronicles of Darkness seams like solo stories could work but any others that i should also consider. 

Any good gm emulators I've heard of mythic but any others emulators that i should consider. 

Any advice for 1 on 1 games in general. 

Also last question any homebrews to buff my solo heros in games where the buff might be needed I've heard of black streams and that you could also give them a few powerful npcs or a bunch of lackeys and i also heard of giving them immortality or at least make them really hard to kill but any other ways of doing it.

rpg,t3_a0rjdu,"Effects of PC Death on Other PCs/RPG with KidsHi all,

I'm a first-time GM playing Pathfinder with my family, with ages ranging from 9-year-old sister to 40-ish mom and dad. In maybe our sixth session, my dad's character died (I will never use phantasmal killer again, but dammit he attacked solo as a level 2 wizard). He was OK with it in the end and seemed to enjoy making his second character, but my younger sister has clearly withdrawn from the game since. I think now that she realizes that her character could actually die, she is playing much more cautiously and seems anxious to play at all. While I'm glad that she's really getting into the game and that events are able to affect her so strongly, I'm worried that I won't be able to keep her interest. Before that death she was super involved and almost the leader of the party, so I think she does enjoy the game as it is.

How can I talk with her - and probably the rest of my players - to help this continue? I understand that if she doesn't want to play I shouldn't force her, but do you have any recommendations on how to re-engage her? Should I try to limit/remove player death, or events that effect her character adversely? How can I do that without leaving out other, older players or making her feel uninterested since everything is easy?

rpg,t3_a0qn3p,"Ideas for Elemental Classes?As part of my setting there are eight elements and most of them are split into two paths.

My character as a Hermetic wizard in a game called Mage the Ascension  who wanted to create the perfect human body.. Exact in ratio, the pinnacle of human ability (like say Captain America) and having every bit of it woven with spells and enchanted. After all this work, he would very much like to inhabit this body instead of his old one. As some examples:

Eyes made out of gems to see the unseen worlds more easily.A heart that can sense danger coming and automatically protect the body. Also keep it safe if the wizards mind happened to be elsewhere (figuratively or literally)

Organs that collect magical energies like a battery and prevent the worst consequences from spells backfiring.

Vampire is a terrific game. It is very different from AD&amp;D in approach &amp; feel. The world of the Vampires is dangerous, political and hierarchical. The drama is psychological, with the spotlight very much on the PC's. This game was first billed as 'personal horror'. Your normal existence has been turned into a nightmare. Emphasise that the backdrop is our modern ordinary world where the supernatural isn't supposed to exist. I mean, who *really* believes in that stuff? Those in the know go to great lengths to hide their existence. Vampire Society makes sure of that: there are rules. There's the Prince of the City to answer to. Newly created Vampires should feel completely at the mercy of the powerful elders who don't have to take any nonsense from these small fry. To turn someone into a Vampire you need the permission of the Prince of that City. The Prince needs to know about the Vampires in his City. It's an important choice to make &amp; there are different reasons why someone might be chosen by members of different clans. The one who is turned into a Vampire will always be the same clan as their sire, the one that turned them. Sometimes someone is embraced without the permission of a City's Prince. Perhaps this City isn't controlled by the Camarilla, perhaps there was an accident, or maybe the Vampire knew that they wouldn't be given permission, or is planning to overthrow the Prince. The rules are clear about what will happen to you when you disobey the Prince in this matter. Sometimes a newly created Vampire is not helped by their sire, because the sire has vanished for whatever reason.\n\nSo the creature or race is Vampires and the clans are if you like, styles of Vampire. When writers of the various World of Darkness games set about creating types of werewolves, magicians, vampires etc they seem to have been thinking of all the different types that could be found in fiction &amp; myth &amp; legend that people might want to play. \n\nMalkavians present a challenge to roleplay, because you don't want to be silly with it, but you also want to enjoy playing the character and seeing it develop over time. Sometimes you'll hear the term 'fishmalks' on forums. I think that that's when it's just done as 'I'm so wacky crazy! in a stupid way. They make for interesting NPC's as well.

rpg,t3_a0mzlj,"Looking for a post-apocalypse rpgHi there. As the title says, I'm looking for an rpg that is post-apocalyptic. Hoever, I have some requirements.

First off, I know about Apocalypse World, but am not interested in it. It's too narrative for my tastes. No offense to the fans of that sort of game of course. PBTA games just aren't really my cup of tea in general.

Second, I'd prefer if it's possible to get a physical copy, but it's would not be a deal breaker if it's pdf only. 

Third, I'm not looking for a generic system. I'd much rather have a system dedicated to this type of game, so things like GURPS, BRP, Savage Worlds, etc, are out.

Now, as for the type of apocalypse I'm looking for, I want something either along the lines of Mad Max, or possibly the Fallout videos games in terms of setting. I'd rather avoid a zombie apocalypse type setting, as that would be more leaning towards horror or the likes.

So, if anyone know of any systems that fit with what I'm looking for, please let me know.

rpg,t3_a0mpzo,"Psychology, Sanity, FearWhat games have you seen do this well? Obviously a number of horror type games concentrate on sanity and the like, but I'm curious if there are games that handle more mundane mental trauma well. I'd love to see mechanics whereby PCs confronted with horrific violence had to cope with that somehow. 

Weirdly, my favorite interpretation of this isn't from a TTRPG at all, but the CRPG Darkest Dungeon. The notion that the players acquire stress from the stuff they are doing and then have to go deal with that after the fact in the form of various vices/activities. 

The problem I always run into when trying to think through this problem is that the majority of sanity or fear mechanics tend to deprotagonize the PCs in some important ways, robbing them of agency by dictating their responses to some degree. 

I'm not sure what the appropriate compromise here would be. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a0mpzo/psychology_sanity_fear/,"['Unknown Armies 3rd edition does this pretty well. Characters have ""shock gauges"", which are essentially a set of five meters that measure how much bad stuff you\'ve had to deal with in the categories of Helplessness, Isolation, Violence, Unnatural, and the Self. \n\nAt either end of those gauges is a skill. This means that for every skill that benefits from being exposed to that shock, there is one that weakens. For example, someone with very little experience with Violence is going to have an easier time Connecting to others; but someone who has seen bloodshed often will be better at Struggling for their lives.\n\nIn addition, being low on a gauge means that when that shock happens to you, you are more likely to panic or otherwise freak out. Someone who has never seen a real gun fire before is going to lose their shit if someone opens fire at them sooner than a war veteran. But, if you\'re too high on too many gauges, then you burn out, struggling to relate to others and losing a lot of your most powerful abilities.\n\nThis system works well because it means that traumatic experiences don\'t stop you from playing, but they do force you to move from playing one kind of character (a lighthearted, friendly person) to a very different one (a cynical, violent, paranoid person).', ""&gt; Weirdly, my favorite interpretation of this isn't from a TTRPG at all, but the CRPG Darkest Dungeon. The notion that the players acquire stress from the stuff they are doing and then have to go deal with that after the fact in the form of various vices/activities. \n\nYou should check out Blades in the Dark. In Blades you accumulate stress to help you do things or resist consequences. Accumulate too much and you get a trauma. You get to play up or down how much your trauma impacts your actual character, but when you let it be a problem for you you get XP. For my table at least, it's led to a number of interesting conversations as players come up with ideas to swing that extra XP from their Trauma while still adding to the story in a sensible matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"", 'Check out the new Delta Green line including Fall of Delta Green.\n\nTrauma in those games can put strain on relationships and other sources of stability like faith instead of just taking agency from the player.', 'For some reason the game that came to mind for me first was ""Tales From the Loop"".\n\nNow, horrific violence is not really part of it. But it is about kids dealing with situations which could easily be traumatic (and most real-world, ""mundane"" trauma originates in childhood). Kids can\'t die, but instead they accrue damage in their stats, with each stat requiring a different method to heal it. For instance, a disheartened kid might need a friend to reassure them before they can be effective again. \n\nWhere I find the promise of trauma in the game, though, is the juxtaposition of kids struggling with mundane trauma (my parents are breaking up and that girl I kind of like hanging out with is moving away) and exploring fantastical retro sci-fi like giant robots and roaming dinosaurs all at once. There\'s something really poignant about exploring coping with childhood trauma through exploration of the fantastical (not that this is necessarily the intent of the game itself, but it does encourage you to dedicate equal time to the kid\'s mundane problems and fantastical adventures).\n\nIf you do want something more typically horror, though, Fear Itself is a game of normal people facing traumatizing (and potentially gruesomely lethal) horror, and it has a pair of mechanics that drives the horror. One is your ""source of stability"" which is the thing that keeps you stable (a person, activity, or trait, with an emphasis on people but also the understanding that in a horror game, people can be liabilities for the horror to use against you). The other side is your ""risk factor"" which is the answer to ""Why not just run away?""\n\nI\'m not sure I understand what you mean that the majority of sanity/fear mechanics rob PCs of agency, though. On some level, is that not what you\'re signing up for in a horror game? On some level, fear is the anticipation of loss of agency (whether because something\'s going to force harm on you, manipulate your mind, rob you of everything you\'ve ever loved, etc). Even real-world, mundane trauma can result in the loss of some agency in some ways. Not that your game needs to emulate that, but I feel like if it doesn\'t it\'s closer to a dark fantasy or something.', 'Most of the ones I\'d recommend have already been mentioed in detail: Gumshoe games (Trail of Cthulhu, Fear Itself, Esoterrorists), Unknown Armies (for the Madness gauges), Delta Green (Sanity with Sources of Stability). \n\nIn additional to those, I might actually include the FATE game (though the system itself isn\'t generally suited to horror), it does have a Mental Stress meter and you can avoid taking Mental Stress by taking ""Consequences"" which can be any sort of mental trauma.

rpg,t3_a0m7ps,"Which of these settings would you rather see as an RPG?I am currently torn between two settings for my homebrew and would like you guys to help me decide. 

Setting 1- Fracture- In this universe there are many different 'planets' or plains of existence, between them is the Void which is inhabited by all sorts of Lovecraftian creatures. Magic is everywhere in this world, and everyone is capable of using it. It can do anything from killing people to creating pocket dimensions. It's also used to power fantasy equivalents of sci-fi technologies, such as 'spaceships' used for travelling the Void and mechs that look more like giant suits of armor. There are all sorts of strange creatures, and at times, the setting can even be considered a space opera. This is my attempt at creating a fantasy setting that feels truly alien, and is not constrained by the laws of science. 

Setting 2- Afterwards- At the dawn of the 23rd century, a horde of mutants used as bioweapons nearly destroyed humanity. By the 2880s, they've recovered, and created new, primitive societies ranging from wastelander tribes to medieval empires. This world could be considered vaguely cyberpunk, as players would augment and genetically modify themselves instead of leveling up. Players explore a ruined Earth and beyond, in a world filled with technological abominations. There is no magic, despite what some primitives might think, with technology both advanced and salvaged filling the role instead. This is the polar opposite of Fracture, instead being a fallen society that believes the world around them to be magical.

Why are you sticking together?”\n\nThe answer can vary from companionship to shared goals to life-debts to contracts but it gives SOME reason for people to stick together for a while.\n\nI don’t always have the entire group together like this- my current campaign started with two groups- a pair of scholars and their warrior-guard and two criminals- being forced to work together on a job.

rpg,t3_a0m2cc,"GMs/Players: how do you deal with the possibility of failure in your games? (esp in mysteries)When it comes to investigations and mysteries, do you feel that the GM (or system, a la GUMSHOE) should do everything they can to get the players to ""solve"" the mystery, or do you think that it's fine to let players fail at the central mystery? 

I feel like the former is an attempt to play a thriller with the trappings of a mystery. Nothing wrong with that, even Sherlock Holmes feels like that sometimes. I think that some players want to actual make the logical inferences and solve the puzzle themselves, but that puts them in the position where they might not be able to succeed. Does failure suck the fun out of playing mysteries? It seems to me that many of the solutions for mysteries (esp GUMSHOE and the Three Clue Rule) is to make failure not an option, and something about that (maybe something old school) strikes me as unsatisfactory. 

If you think it's fine that players can fail, how do you feel about sticking in a game when you fail again and again? Do you feel like you have to have a number of ""easier"" cases that they can figure out and only throw hard ones in every now and then? And if you're playing something like Call of Cthulhu, where failure at key moments often results in death, does that also undermine players' willingness to keep at it? 

And this can really extend past mysteries. Would players be willing to stay in a fantasy campaign if they can never defeat the Big Bad, even if it's one that's not intended as a recurring character? They might accept that they can't defeat an Evil Empire, but a consistent failure against smaller threats? 

Also, I know it depends on the group and how the scenarios are run. I've also listened to the Jackson Elias podcast. I was wondering how *you* felt about it, and how you deal with failure in your games. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a0m2cc/gmsplayers_how_do_you_deal_with_the_possibility/,"['The way I deal with it is that I view the campaign as more than just a single narrative arc - even if that narrative arc is somewhat epic in scope.  It\'s okay if the arc fails, or if characters die, etc..  because what the campaign is to my group is everything within the setting and more importnatly, how it changes over time.  So a failure is not a cut to credits, ""terminate the campaign"" trigger, rather it\'s just one of many consequences that will then feedback into how the setting evolves along with the characters inside it.\n\nAlso you have to fail a lot before you figure out how to succeed.  I experienced a lot of trouble with crafting good mysteries because I simply never ran them before...at least not truly - I would always fudge results and the path to make sure there was success.  But when I gave that up to try to run actual mysteries and puzzles, there was a definite learning curve for both me and my players.  But with practice you get better at it.  My advice would be to start small and easy.  The simplest mystery when run straight can be a very difficult thing for players to figure out.  And as you run these smaller mysteries, the group as a whole will learn from each other - they will learn how to read and interpret your designs and you\'ll learn how your players work out clues and piece together solutions.', 'I\'m not sure you\'re characterizing GUMSHOE correctly. Success and failure aren\'t necessarily a function of clue acquisition.\n\n* You can get all the clues and fail to put them together\n* You can get all the clues and still fail to foil the plot\n* You can get all the clues and still be defeated in combat\n* You can get all the clues and and simply not do it in time\n\nThere are a LOT of paths to failure in a GUMSHOE game. But the problem that GUMSHOE was designed to address is that simply stopping the game dead in its tracks because someone (or worse, *everyone*) fails an arbitrary roll is NOT a fun option. Clues are specifically defined in GUMSHOE as the information you need to move to the next scene - getting clues propels the story. So failing to get clues - in any system - means (under this definition) that the players don\'t have the necessary information to move the story forward. \n\nMost failed rolls don\'t have this impact. \n\nThere\'s a huge difference between ""Oh! That\'s a 1! Your bullet goes well wide of the cult leader and now every eye in the huge, packed temple is searching for the source of the shot!"" and ""Well, you\'ve failed your research roll. Are you and the rest of the team are still tearing apart the library in vain three days later when the ground opens up and demons devour you? Or did you give up and have a drunken orgy in the time you had left?"" \n\n\n', ""I think my main concern, as the GM, would be whether I had made the solution to the mystery too mysterious for a reasonable person to solve.  Getting that balance between blindingly obvious and impossible to fathom is actually quite difficult.\n\nYou often get the same issue in CRPG's, but there at least you can real on someone to publish a walkthrough guide that tells everyone what the solution is."", ""I think scene management as a storyteller is also important. Solving a mystery takes time and you don't want to waste scenes where you know players aren't capable of advancing their findings. The solution to this can vary: only play out scenes where clues exist, alert players that a scene is dry of clues, and/or identify that this something is a 'Clue'.\n\nAnd I would second removing rolls from fact-finding. But I wouldn't GIVE them the clues. I'm with you on that one. They certainly should have to work for it AND try to put them to together. Have them ask questions to find clues, answer them truthly. "", ""Let's just focus on yourself for the moment - would you have fun if you spent two hours playing then failed to figure the mystery at the end?\n\nThe problem with mysteries is they tend to suggest only two possible endings - solve the mystery or fuck it, we don't know what happened.\n\nThere's not much room for partially suceeding and partially failing there. In fact there's no room for that.\n\nBut focusing just on yourself for now, would a game where you can end with degrees of success sound fun to you? Like maybe there are ten elements to the overall mystery, so you could end it having solved eight or so of the elements...sound fun?\n\nIf so then you can make the first few elements very easy or that just by the players putting in the time and not looking at their phones they will solve the first four elements or so...the latter elements have a slowly increasing difficulty.\n\nThat way it's not a hard binary of figuring it all out or utterly failing."", ""Outside of mysteries, I think it is possible to allow the group to fail.  My group just failed on three major plot points.  They are rather dejected because of it, but now they plan to do what they can to rebuild.  \n\nTwo were a failure was due to a player mistake, telling an NPC something they shouldn't have.  One was a failure of the party to track time and they missed a deadline that meant that an item changed hands before they were able to warn them not to do it.  \n\nThey had some great success as well, just those three points fell.  \n\nI think letting players know they can fail if they don't complete tasks and make deadlines is important.  It means they have to keep track of what is going on and pay attention.\n\n\n""]"

there's this tank hobbit, because why the hell not? he is chaotic good uses spears and heavy armor, and has some strange fascination with rocks. he has a pet fairy that argues with him why is he the owner if she's bigger than him

we have this bissexual jawless pyromancer (the jawless part is result of 2 crits), chaotic evil and he is hungry for power, basically a megalomaniac, wants to be able to destroy whole cities with a snap of fingers. he has a lil spyro as pet

&amp;#x200B;

oh yes, there is this necromancer that wants to become a lich in order to harness the entirety of human knowledge, sorta cliche if you ask me but he is true neutral actually, he does not want to conquer and slave humanity, he wants the knowlege for the sake of it, has a undead spyro as a pet

rpg,t3_a0lh54,"Help me come up with monsters based on seasons and holidays.This is for a Monster of the Week campaign I plan to run in the near future. Players of mine read no further.

So the basic idea is that there’s four courts of monsters based on the four seasons. The traditional seasonal holidays in our world (Christmas, Halloween, Easter, and Midsummer) actually date back to ancient festivals in which humans placated the seasonal courts by emulating their styles and such.

Nowadays the four courts are ruled by evil rulers and the monsters are causing havoc during their seasons. I am, however, having trouble coming up with seasonal/holiday monsters, especially for the spring and summer seasons. Here’s some stuff I’ve got so far:

    
**Spring**    

A giant pastel spider monster that hides its eggs throughout the city.

A monster that CAN NOT be killed. It just keeps resurrecting. It has to be banished.

    
**Summer**    

A giant fiery salamander. We don’t celebrate Midsummer in my country so I’m having a lot of trouble getting inspiration here.    


**Fall**    

A creature made of candy that must be eaten.

The Headless Horseman.

A creature that gives masks to children allowing it to take over their minds.

A powerful witch with a monster cat familiar.    


**Winter**    

A Nazgul like group of 12 dark swordsmen. Red and Green hooded robes, candy striped swords.

A witch in a giant, sprawling gingerbread manor. Gingerbread doors are appearing throughout the city and people are disappearing through them.

A ghost of Christmas past?

The Nutcracker General and his soulless toy soldiers.

rpg,t3_a0l5b0,"What value does ""darkness"" bring to the table? Do you use it in your games?I'm talking about regular, ol' darkness. It's hard to see, or impossible to see. It's dark. 

As a character, I'd better have a torch or a flashlight if I want to do anything. Or maybe I can see in the dark because I have special vision. Maybe everybody at the table has special vision, so none of us ever worry about the darkness.

Most games, as you've stated, many characters have something special so it's not dark to them, but those times I catch someone who doesn't have anything special, and finds themselves alone in the dark, I do my best to make it feel enveloping, compounding, and dense, to drive home the feeling of paranoia.\n\nI draw from an experience in my own life. I was 10, walking a mile home from a friend's house, middle of winter, down a snowy dirt road. It was pitch black, with just the barest of sliver of moon in the sky. The snow, clumping on the sides of trees, gave them odd shapes. I was terrified as I pushed myself to take each step, one after the other. Just before the turn to my house I stopped, staring at an old, dead tree. The snow was stuck to its dead bark in such a way that co-mingled with the darkness, it looked like a white, slender woman, standing in the snow pointing at me.

And the sparking of a sun rod or some other burst of light, followed immediately by a pounce attack, makes a great start for an encounter.\n\nIt's also a great medium for adding uncertainty to eyewitness accounts.  What I mean is that it's perfectly acceptable to tell a player that they *think* they see this or that when they wouldn't get a clear view.  I had a group of PCs argue for sessions on end over whether it was a wild animal or a hired NPC watching them in their sleep.

Specifically, it has a table of different ""types"" of Dark and how to effectively describe them for players. The bestiary in this book also describes its monsters in terms of sound and smell since it\'s assuming the PCs will never see the monsters. I\'d HIGHLY recommend this module.', 'I can think of 3 reasons I\'ve used it, \n\n1. To highlight and/or make-matter a choice a player made like getting a spell that allows them extrasensory perception, or bringing along special goggles or ocular implants. This is one way where I as the GM don\'t have to be the one ""using"" darkness. The players themselves can choose to do something at night specifically because of the darkness.\n\n2. To add some challenge. It CAN be something that adds an interesting challenge, either by forcing the characters to hold a torch in one hand, or in a system where trifling materials like rope and torches are lumped together into one resource for abstraction, it can be used to consume that resource. Such a system has already made the choice that ""Do I have a torch?"" is handled so simply. If it isn\'t, darkness can be either interesting or boring depending on your group. Some people love preparing, some people find it a slog.\n\n3. For effect. Darkness and scarce sources of light can make a scene much more cinematic, even if it doesn\'t have a mechanical effect. Describing the scene when light only comes from one small source can be far more evocative. I can remember a scene in a dark room in which a PC used a flamethrower, and my mental image of it is so much more vivid because of the darkness and usage of light.\n\nI want to specifically address D&amp;D though, because it and Darkvision are mentioned so much here:\n\nD&amp;D is game of get-out-of-challenge-free cards. It\'s a game where the only meat and depth is in combat and it\'s stuffed with spells and skills and designed to let you skip over any non-combat source of tension. That\'s why even though D&amp;D is the most popular TTRPG, I just can\'t even consider it when answering questions like this. Of course every character has Darkvision. Darkness is a challenge with no HP that you can\'t swing a sword at until it dies, so D&amp;D does not respect it.', ""Very few groups I've played with have bothered tracking it in much detail. It's usually a matter of 'who is carrying the torch?' if that. And, so many of the races in 5E D&amp;D have darkvision that even that sometimes isn't a factor.\n\nThat said, it seems like virtual table tops like Roll20 can automate keeping track of light and visibility in interesting ways. Watching the Roll20 Presents D&amp;D streams has been really interesting in that regard."", 'In my game, rolls are based on a contextual difficulty decided by the GM. In that sense, darkness is like anything else, that in the context of the roll would make it more difficult. Searching a dark room, climbing a wet wall, running through dense foliage.', 'I played a Basic Fantasy game where half of the party had darkvision.\n\nI rolled up a halfling thief with a wisdom of five.\n\nBeing tasked with scouting a fort in the dark, off I go with my little torch.', ""Visibility rarely has a mechanical effect, as it almost always has an immediate solution as light sources or other ways of seeing are usually handy. Sometimrs you'll catch someone in combat that forgot to carry a torch and you'll get to use the mechanics but IME that's exceedingly rare.\n\nWhat it is useful for is atmospherics. Daylight is different than flickering torchlight, darkvision is in greyscale In a perfect world, the way the dm describes an area would always take the light source into account."", ""If you are infiltrating something, it becomes an important factor since any light source also means you can be spotted in turn.\n\nSo it's a risk/reward factor.\n\nPLus each type of light source pre-modern tech, has ups and downs. Oil lamps can cause a fire and torches will choke you with smoke."", 'I\'ve come back around to tracking light and darkness more precisely after years of either handwaving it or treating it as unimportant. I mostly play games where all the PCs are humans, and darkvision or its equivalent is very rare.  \n\n\nIn fantasy dungeon-crawling, I split all light sources into two basic types - ones that cast beams of light, and ones that create pools of light. Beams let you examine one object or thing in bright light, while pools are dim light unless they overlap with another pool. I use a group perception rule, so pools of light let more group members contribute to perception checks while searching an area, but dim light causes one to be ""Bad At"" (my equivalent of disadvantage, giving a -2 penalty) on any task requiring sight.   \n\n\nI\'ve also reduced the range of most light sources. Torches only light up a 3m radius pool (I use 2m squares, so they light up the square a PC is in + adjacent ones). Lanterns light up a 5m radius pool, unless they\'re bullseye lanterns in which case they cast a beam for 5m. Light spells either create a 9m pool or a 9m beam. I also have flares that light up a 15m radius pool, but only burn for a single turn (10 min). This forces PCs to get close to things in order to examine them with good light, and creates a bit of a claustrophobic feeling.  \n\n\nSome effects of this on play include:   \n\n\n1) PCs are usually either hugging the walls of a room, or have little idea of its dimensions from plunging into its centre.  \n2) It\'s easy for things to come tottering out of the darkness or retreat back into it.  \n3) Explaining why the PCs didn\'t see something is more straightforward when there isn\'t a ton of light.  \n4) Managing light resources is a bigger deal.', 'I love using darkness in a campaign ONLY when some of the party has darkvision. \n\nIf everyone or nobody can see in the dark, it\'s not as fun as when something moves into one character\'s view and they say ""uh oh"" and all the other players say ""uh oh what. **UH OH WHAT?**""', 'I feel like it\'s underused in my games. I once heard something to the effect of ""With a flashlight, you can see about twenty feet ... and be seen from half a mile."" In the very-original games, there was always the fear that the torch would go out. \n\nThere\'s a lot of things that it feels like people have decided to politely ignore. Like ""Bows are really high maintenance"" or ""If you fall in the water, ALL your stuff gets wet, that includes spell books and bowstrings and food."" Or starvation, thirst, and disease.   \n\n\nSome of it is understandable - mapping is a huge pain in the ass when the GM describes it to you. (I\'ve occasionally thought about grabbing like a DOOM level generator or something and letting people find their way through the maze like it\'s a 3-D shooter and THEN they can make maps.) So ""You get lost"" should be a real threat, but it\'s not because the social overhead of mapping everything is HUGE when ""You see a corridor that goes thirty feet and turns right"" is your input device. (""thirty feet right wall, forty feet left?"")', 'Literally 99% of everything in D&amp;D has dark vision so nothing ', 'Darkness is used in my primary game as a handy tool by both PCs and their adversaries. It can be pretty scary and is used to excellent effect.', 'I’ve been running a game where only one or two members of the party have dark vision and I’ve found it keeps the players communicating in-character, which is nice. \nLarge dark rooms are best the way to use darkness/vision limits I think. Dark vision and torchlight only go so far, and playing with the line of effect/shadows cast by light sources can make for interesting combats. \nOne of my parties fought a giant spider in a large room full of pillars, completely dark except for their vision/lamps. I had the spider hide in the shadows they cast, and had an NPC ally attack the spider from just out of the PCs’ view.

It also plays into both fixed and random encounters in that a light source in a totally dark dungeon is a literal beacon to anything walking, crawling or slithering out there."", ""In Fate, tactically relevant darkness would be a scene aspect, which means it's both narratively true and mechanically important. It's probably not a scene aspect *on its own*, though; for the sake of keeping table clutter down, it's probably subsumed into some other, broader aspect. *Dingy Dockside Warehouse*?

So you have to start somewhere.\n\nThe best advice otherwise is to stick to core rules when starting a new RPG. People tend to buy books or download stuff from the internet, just to build that super character or because it looks cool. Say no and start with the core stuff. There is really no need to involve everything from the start. Keep it simple and focused in the beginning, there is enough time to grow into more stuff and rules."", ""From a GM perspective, FFG's narrative dice system is a royal pain in the ass. It takes way too long to resolve the simplest actions. I think West End Games d6 Star Wars, Savage Worlds and Hollow Earth Expedition are much easier to learn and run. "", 'I\'m going to emphatically say NO, for a few reasons:\n\n1. FFG Star Wars, as much as I love it, is part of a subset of roleplaying games that are, in part, designed to sell you a lot of books. You can easily spend $600 or more trying to get your hands on a bunch of the books, so you can have more detail on sub-systems and specific character types within the game. Experienced tabletop gamers are somewhat inured to this, as it was a dominant trend for thirty years. Thankfully, we\'re now in an era where indie games are more self-contained and are not designed to support large game development companies that need to produce a lot of content to stay afloat, so you can play some amazing games at very low cost to yourself.\n\n2. FFG Star Wars is more of an intermediate game to pick up. It\'s a touch mechanics-heavy, which means you need to puzzle through the rules to \'play the game right\'. It\'s also highly narrative, which requires interpretation and confidence to run. It\'s probably a great game for new players with an experienced Gamemaster, but I wouldn\'t recommend it for a new GM with new players. \n\nI\'d recommend taking a look at Jez Gordon\'s [Star Wars D6 Rules Essentials](http://gibletblizzard.blogspot.com/2018/05/star-wars-d6-character-sheet-5-pages.html), his ""streamlined \'best of\' from all the early editions of the greatest Star Wars roleplaying game"". \n\nIt\'s 100% **free** and built off of an award-winning Star Wars game that also happened to be the first one, and is/was deeply beloved (the d6 original). If his free stuff doesn\'t do it for you and your group and you absolutely have to invest in the shinier FFG version, at least you\'ll know that buying into the more expensive game is the One True Way for you, and not just the only apparent option.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, I\'ve bought almost all of the FFG Star Wars books, but I\'m an RPG collector of almost 40 years and I want them because I like the game and system, the books are gorgeous, and because they go out of print all the time and so increase in value. It\'s not a simple game to run, though, and it *will* drain your pocketbook.\n\nEdit: I\'m also going to recommend [One Seven Design Studio](http://www.onesevendesign.com/). John Harper is a highly-recognized indie game developer who produced a lot of free RPGs that he\'s released on that website (not all are free there, though most are). *Lasers &amp; Feelings* is particularly well-regarded. It\'s more Star Trek than Star Wars, but your group can take any of those games (*Danger Patrol* is also pretty impressive, though unfinished) and see what you think of the hobby and work the kinks out of how you play together before you invest a bunch of money into the hobby. After a few weeks of trying out well-designed free games, if you want to plunk down $60 for *Edge of the Empire* or something else, you\'ll be better prepared for getting the most out of it.', 'Lots of great comments on this post. One thing that I would add is that a lot of the game mechanics used in EotE are unique to that game. Especially the dice; you’d be hard-pressed to find another system like it.  I’m a big fan of the dice system of EotE, but it doesn’t transition well into other systems.  What I mean is that it’s harder to assume other rpg systems are like EotE. And once you buy those dice, you can’t reuse them for D&amp;D or another d20, d10 or d6 system. \n\nJust something to think about. ', 'It’s how I got started, loving the setting was a good motivation to take the plunge. ', ""I have had about a dozen different people start roleplaying with me in EotE, from 11 to 25. The dice seem to be easier for people to get their head around if they've played less rpgs. There are plenty of good premade adventures to make the GM's job easier."", 'I think it’s definitely a solid experience, but I will warn you that it is quite different from other tRPGs, mostly because it uses its own system with its own special dice. It has its advantages and drawbacks. \n\nIt’s defining feature for me is a special die that you roll to determine fate, which is to give a situation a bit more character. Let’s say you roll the normal dice well but roll this die poorly while trying to unlock a door. Well, you may open the door, but fate would have it that you also set off the alarm. It creates a lot of opportunities for creative and engaging situations, but sometimes it can be seen as frustrating and tiresome. The choice is yours, I personally lean towards favoring the system against others.', 'Great choice IMO.  Beginner box does a great job of teaching the mechanics.', ""If you like Star Wars EotE seems like a good place to start. Maybe give the Essential NPCs podcast a listen to get a feel for it. In season 8 they play the Star Wars RPG (I think they combined all 3 settings). If you don't wanna listen to the whole season just listen the last episode of season 8 to get an idea what the different players think about the game and to get an rather extensive synopsis of what to except and how EotE works."", ""Not to self-promote - but I wrote a blog post about some useful things that made my time with the game easier.\n\n[http://www.fandible.com/helpful-resources-star-wars-fantasy-flight-games/](http://www.fandible.com/helpful-resources-star-wars-fantasy-flight-games/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe dice app I got for the game did cost me 5 bucks but it was 100% worth it. Made the whole dice rolling aspect very easy to manage. So that's the one thing I really recommend. "", ""YES YES YES GET IT GET IT NOW GET IT HAHAHAHAH YEEESSSSS!\n\nI mean...it's a good game. I like it.\n\nIt's not the lightest game out there mechanically, but it's nowhere near as garbage-laden and ridiculous as Pathfinder or Shadowrun. It's well written, well laid out, and well explained with lots of good examples. \n\n"", ""Just pick up one of the starter box sets, use the premade characters and the simpler rules and have at it. (The Edge of the Empire one is about scoundrels and normal people, force plays little part in it.  So if you want more force users, look at the other starter boxes)\n\nThere are so many games that have starter sets, it's easy to try out different games with little investment.  Just get used to the more free form story telling you have with Edge of the Empire compared to others.\n\nGood luck GM, it's a thankless job.  If you enjoy telling a story and seeing how people react and add to that story, you'll enjoy GMing.\n\nOh, and get the dice rolling app. It will help.\n\nIf you like the rules but want a different setting (Fantasy, for example), then look at Genesys later. It's the same system tweaked for generic RPG settings that is fully customizable (basically you can build any setting with the rules). Lots of customization and the dice are similar to Star Wars.  Lots of player content out there plus at least one official fantasy setting."", 'Awesome! I know that I want to get it, and I’ve built a group, all of whom are interested in RPGs and are Star Wars fans. Now all I need is to get around the fact that I’m a teenager with not even a penny of disposable income and then I’ll be good.\nEdit: I’m gonna try to trade in some video games that I don’t play to Amazon to get some money so this shouldn’t be a problem', ""I'm a fan of the Saga Edition, but I have taken ideas from EotE."", ""Yes.   \n\n\nIt's about as mechanically complex as most mainstream RPGs. "", ""Its called a beginner's box for a reason. its actually designed so that you can literally open the box and start playing, though this will involve a bit of people sitting around waiting for the GM to read the next section.  Things work better if the GM pre-reads the adventure before the start of the session. "", ""Yes, EotE would be a great way to start totally new players into RPGs.  Especially if they like the Star Wars universe. \n\nYou'll have a very rare thing in doing so.  A group that didn't cut their teeth on D&amp;D or a direct D&amp;D based game."", '[removed]', 'Star Wars is generally a good RPG for new players and groups because it is pretty instantly familiar with most players who are fans of the films, so it doesn\'t require a bunch of exposistion to explain what the game is about. Its also pretty flexible in that your roguish scoundrels, gunslinging bounty hunters, space wizards and weird aliens will fit just about any player style easily, giving a wide range of characters to play. But there are drawbacks, players who are familiar with the setting may want to constantly correct you if stuff isn\'t ""in canon"" (which is why I always run stuff on the fringe of the Outer Rim, to avoid those ""Well that wasn\'t in the movie"" conversations), you also get PCs who want to police the ethics of the ""Force"" quite a bit ""A Jedi would never do XYZ"" (its the same kind of arbitrary moral arguements you get about Alignment in D&amp;D, ""A Lawful Good Paladin would never steal!"" ""Even from a demon?"" that kind of thing can last hours and ultimately isn\'t useful, just play your character), Star Wars isn\'t true scifi so you don\'t want to get bogged down with arguements about lightspeed or technology, its effectively Space Fantasy, so don\'t worry if a technology isn\'t well explained how it works or why it isn\'t more widespread in the galaxy, etc. Just assume a lot of the really advanced tech is super old and noone knows how to replicate it anymore or something to that effect.', 'I started off with Pathfinder before playing other RPGs and I would personally recommend that to you as well. It can certainly be complicated if you want it to be, but it can also be really fun and casual even with a group of people that have never played a RPG before ', 'It was my first rpg, and while I don’t have a ton of experience with other systems I can definitely say its friendly to beginners. Once you get used to the custom dice, everything else is pretty intuitive (besides space combat). \n\nOne thing I will point out though is that the focus is on the narrative, and combat isn’t as tactical as in a game like DnD—characters don’t have as many explicit abilities/spells/options combat wise. For that reason, if you’re the GM (and to a lesser extent if you’re a player) you have to be careful to keep combat interesting through cool descriptions and creative actions/events, otherwise it can turn into a grind of “I attack you, you attack me.” For example, you’ll need to keep things cinematic by coming up with stuff like this: Spending a dark side point to say that an enemy notices the crates above the PCs are unstable, then having them shoot the supports out (this might even be less effective mechanically than the npc making an attack, but the players won’t be thinking of that). GMing in ffg star wars is as much showmanship as rules adjudication, in my experience.', 'The most important thing to know about this game is that every roll takes time to interpret. Which can bog down the game. I suggest going to scribd and either playing Star Wars RPG Revised Edition, or even Star Wars Saga Edition. Both are good choices and will create a great Star Wars experience and familiarize you with the d20 system, the most popular these days.', ""It would have been my first rpg but we couldn't figure out the dice mechanics. It is fairly convoluted. We decided to play alternity instead, which is an amazing scifi rpg. \n\nI would recommend alternity or gurps for a scifi campaign. "", ""**My choice for a new a player**\n\nLady Blackbird. It's free, uses d6s, it's got pre-gens, a story, and excellent design that has inspired tons of games and hacks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you want a game where you get to make content?**\n\nI'll throw my hat down for Cortex+ for a new player. It's a minimalist system with modular parts that forces both the GM and the players to put their characters first instead of making huge MMO-style builds of equipment and ability trees. It's about narrative advantages, locations, and relationships. Good for making an RPG out of a strong TV Drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you want a game that has content?**\n\nD&amp;D. Call of Cthulhu. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**An indie game with a strong setting or simple rules?**\n\nBlades in the Dark (Steampunk assassins, heists, weird magic). \n\nThe Hard Way (70, 80s, action heroes). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Star Wars Edge of the Empire**\n\nI love Star Wars but I'm in the unpopular camp that thinks Edge is a poorly designed system that fails by having too much content that is not very balanced, and an extremely crunchy system that focuses so much on combat but executes it so poorly when compared to D&amp;D and other great games. I second West End's d6 Star Wars."", ""It's not a beginner game. The special dice are an extra layer of hassle, and there is not enough examples for something as vague as 'something good/bad happens' with the different skills.\n\nIt's also on the heavier side as mechanics go, and while a certain degree of 'learning the system' is appealing as a new player, there's easier ways to go about it."", 'As someone who loves the system mechanics in RPGs I would also suggest another system. As LonoXIII stated the West End version is quite nice (my favourite Star Wars system).  I fondly remember their treatment of the 7 different lightsaber combat styles\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou might also want to give the Savage World version a try. Savage world is really great for high adventure pulp kinda games.  Shooting blasters while holding onto a flying ship, dancing through enemies wielding a lightsaber , all kind of fun stuff.   \n\n\nAnd someone also mentioned the DnD 5e mod but, I think the West End and Savage World versions are better choice, depending on the game you want', ""Idk how beginner friendly it is, but some people on reddit built a Star Wars RPG straight off of the DnD 5e rules. Pretty sure the sub is r/sw5e. DnD 5e, i feel, is a pretty basic rule set thats easy to learn and master. The Star Wars version is really deep and detailed and could be a great way to start off you and your friends' journies into RPGs! Hope that helped!"", 'I think it kinda depends on the experience you\'re looking for. A bunch of rules-lite or open concept games are good for either high flexibility, ease of participation, or ease of learning/pick-up-and-play such as AGE core, Paranoia, Final Fantasy d6, etc. Then there are a bit more complex \'standard\' rpgs like d&amp;d, 13th age, Numinera. And then the thick, rules upon rules ""if it doesn\'t say it, you can\'t do it"" books like say Shadowrun or Exalted, off the top of my head.\n\n\nAll of which can be bent, twisted, or ignored/remade to fit your group. However, if none of you have any real tabletop experience I highly recommend finding some podcasts or series for the game you want to play (or really any \'mainline\' RPGs like D&amp;D/Shadowrun/Warhammer) to get an idea of flow and player ingenuity/freedom vs storypath vs rules. At the end of the day, it is about having fun. But no matter what you play, as long as you guys are enjoying how you\'re playing it doesn\'t much matter.', 'Yeah no not really, it\'s basically uses dice to make up for lame DMing, or maybe it was inspired by a whiny player who was sick of his DM adding stuff to his rolls so he made a system that had the same thing happen but it was because of the rules not the GM\'s whim so it was entirely badrightfun instead of badwrongfun. Either way, EotE is kinda boring, no real stand-out reason to play it. Nothing particularly exciting in the combat system, the attributes are bog-standard based on developer taste, skills list the same, the book is a giant behemoth and you need to buy special dice to play with little symbols on them because success is just too boring for our modern generation of chin-stroking bloggers so we need to have success with some complication. What\'s the complication? Well from what I could tell that was basically up to you to figure out, but the rules are producing non-binary success and that\'s goodthink in 2018, since d20 systems have binary pass-fail and that\'s badthink, therefore EotE is good. Yeah there might be no context for how this pops up but that\'s true of pretty much every skill check anyway (I can\'t fault them for that). Yeah there might be no good reason why even though you fixed the quantum force generator, some random shit happens and it blows up again, but hey, it\'s a movie-based game so it doesn\'t need to make sense. Hey maybe if you roll high enough, you\'ll suddenly think of a previously-unrecognized method of warfare that employs a technology that has existed for thousands of years but no one thought of using it til now, despite how obvious it is. But hey that sort of thing happens when you have a strong intelligent woman on the job. Those silly men had no idea what they were doing, to have the solution to nearly all forms of warfare in front of their faces for so long and despite trillions of beings existing over millennia on a scale we in the real world cannot comprehend not realizing it. But you did. Because you rolled a Special Success (TM) on your dice. \n\nIn short, I see absolutely nothing that EotE besides produce non-contextual results for the sake of fitting in with the narrative crowd. And then lumping the burden of actually creating the actual result on the GM. Sure they might have some suggestions for specific skills or maybe even in combat, but beyond that I don\'t really see much reason to play. Also if it\'s dice pool odds are it\'s already incredibly non-granular. Which is fine, but I\'m just saying. Oh and how does it solve the Jedi balance issue? I believe it doesn\'t let you play as a Jedi? Does it even try to balance the two together even though one is objectively more powerful in the movies (I mean what would be the fucking point of the Force otherwise?)? No, it gets out of that particular bind, but it\'s still valid to shit on d20 Star Wars for having the two side-by-side as though every campaign is created in vacuum where you can play a Jedi in any campaign anywhere in Star Wars and GM restriction never applies. I mean there are plenty of valid reasons to shit on d20 Star Wars, and admittedly a disclaimer on class balance would have been nice. But pretending that EotE does better in that regard by not including the class at all is disingenuous, I could achieve the same result by ripping out all the jedi pages from my Star Wars d20 books. \n\nHonestly you could probably play any other system and add in a ""wild die"" with your skill checks that pops up to add an extra complication or great success, or else just introduce MoS/F mechanics, or maybe both, and have roughly the same result. But hey never miss an opportunity to sell trademarked overpriced chunks of plastic as a barrier of entry to your game, then use the most popular franchise of anything anywhere ever to sling-assist it past its mediocrity into the limelight. That\'s smart marketing, I don\'t know if it\'s smart to play the game. I mean if you\'ve never played an RPG you\'re not gonna have any distinction either way. I played Mathf -- I mean, Pathfinder, for years without knowing any different. ', 'No. I would start with medieval fantasy or Asian Fantasy. I would also limit spells that allow player to fly or anything that would challenge you to much as a new GM.']"

rpg,t3_a0kt4t,"How to manage combat values ?Hi everyone 
I'm working on my very first adventure that I plan on doing with friends and I didn't use anything that already existed like a DnD rule book because I wanted everything to be my creation even the combat system.
But now that I'm almost done there's one thing that puzzles me how much damages should my players deals ? How much HP should their enemies have ? And everything like that, I want the adventure to be challenging but I'm afraid that if I mess up those numbers it'll either make the adventure too easy or too hard and ruin the fun in either cases ?
So is there any ground rules I should follow on how to balance those values ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a0kt4t/how_to_manage_combat_values/,"[""I'm afraid it won't end well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be able to design a working system one needs experience with playing and running many different games. The first game you design won't help you run it and you running a game for the first time won't be able to compensate for its weaknesses.\n\nI've been there and I made the mistake of designing with not enough experience. Most of my early creations have hopefully been forgotten. One evolved into a playable game, but it took redesigning the system from the ground up, four times - and improving the setting each time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for your specific question, it's hard to answer without any knowledge of the rest of your system. As a very rough guideline, a typical enemy (or player character) should take 3-4 hits before going down; minions should be one-shot, possibly with several being taken out with a single action; bosses should need about 3 rounds of attacks from the whole party, with the most powerful abilities available."", 'Oh boy first adventure AND first system?\n\nYou’re quite ambitious.\n\nHowever, these are questions we really can’t answer for your without any context as to how your combat works exactly.\n\nHow much damage should your PCs do? Depends on how many hits you want it to take to kill a monster with the average weapon, how easy it is to hit, etc.\n\nSame for the monsters vs the PCs, his many hits from an average monster should it take to down a PC? How hard is it for monsters to hit the average PC?', ""Honestly you should start with a premade system. I did what you are doing were I designed a system without ever playing anything before and I hit roadblocks constantly because I had no idea how to handle situations I hadn't accounted for. The best thing to do is start with a finished and play tested system and just take notes while playing as to what works and what doesn't for you and your table (and to be honest, I've only felt confident working on my own system after DMing two systems already and both of those were month long campaigns as well). It's great that you already have this ambition, It's a great thing to have and it will come in handy when DMing but I *strongly* suggest you start with something that already works. Play testing is a big part of what makes a system work, and even if you are going in with that expectation with your players, its not gonna make them any less annoyed when you are constantly shifting the game around cause you don't have a reference level for what it is exactly you need to fix.  \n\nAs for what system I would suggest you use, I personally started with 5th Edition D&amp;D and I think its a perfect introduction, it's easy to homebrew your own rules (and that is were you can scratch that designing itch) and is mostly well written, if not a little too loose in areas (but honestly I think of that as a strength since it can be very helpful experience for reading older or poorly written systems). It helps you understand the basic fundamentals of most rpgs, on top of that it is by far the most supported system right now. If you have any questions, most likely someone else has already asked it and there's an answer online somewhere if you just google it.\n\nIf you want something lighter and has really straight forward rules and mechanics, you can use an OSR system (I personally recommend Knave, its the simplest one I've found so far) since their emphasis is on simple character sheets and making all the rules really easy to reference, understand and find in the manual. Just keep in mind that OSR is much more difficult than more modern systems generally, so that may be an issue for you.\n\nAnd if you are looking for some generic systems that can work with most settings, I'd suggest either Fate Accelerated,Primetime Adventures or Savage Worlds.\n\nFate Acc. is pretty different from traditional dnd-esque systems but it has enough in common that its not the hardest thing to understand. It has an emphasis on narrative as opposed to simulation and is a little more collaborative in terms of storytelling (for example, your players can establish details in the setting)\n\nPrimetime Adventures is similiar to Fate in that its emphasis is narrative but it's even simpler. It is supposed to be used for a tv show episodic structure, but that means its pretty open to any kind of settings or story that you can fit into a tv show style.\n\nSavage Worlds in comparison to those two is more complicated but it's a more traditional DND-esque thing. I'd describe the level of rules and mechanics as being somewhere between 5th Edition D&amp;D and 3.5 D&amp;D. It's not the easiest thing to learn and definitely is the hardest out of all the ones I've recommended so far but it's a generic that can work with a lot of different ideas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, now that I've talked your ear off I hope I've given you somewhere to work off of for your first GM experience. And if I haven't convinced you to use another system, well I hope you continue to learn more about design and how RPGs are made cause that is always helpful for designing your own system. Your on the right track friend, TTRPGs always need more DMs, but we need designers even more."", 'Testing values for things like damage and resolution should be longest phase of system creation. Go find some people to play with and test numbers. Get feedback from them. Apply the feedback. Repeat until you have it in a good spot.', 'Is the game realistic? \n\nGetting shot probably ruins your day. Getting shot twice definitely ruins your day.\n\nIf in doubt, 3-4 hits before a character is out of the fight tends to ""feel right"" from a play enjoyment perspective. \n\n', 'You\'re definitely doing it the hard way. You seriously ought to consider taking your story that is almost done and applying that to a system that is *already* done. \n\nYou can\'t really even consider ""balance"" until you know how your mechanics will work. What do your dice rolls look like? What can the PCs do to affect that? What can the villains do to avoid being hit? You can\'t consider villain hit points without also considering how much damage weapons do. There are a **lot** of moving pieces that all have to be working right before you can even start to look at balance from a story standpoint.\n\nIf you\'re serious about making your own system too, you might want to post to /r/rpgdesign as well, they might have more insight into the nitty gritties.

Which one should I get ? 
Can someone name me the pros and cons of each ?

It is however pretty polished and popular.\n\n**Star Wars: Edge of the Empire** (and it's sister systems) are really great systems if you enjoy the mash-up of cinematic, story game dice resolution and traditional RPG progression. They are fiddly to shed the existing setting, but you can also just grab **Genesys** which is the system agnostic version.\n\nIf you are more into hard sci-fi sandboxes and creating your own setting, I highly recommend you check out [**Stars Without Number**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/226996/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition), if the print-on-demand option works well with Brazil. You can check out the [free PDF](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/230009/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition-Free-Version?src=newest) version which has 80% of the content (which is fine if you don't want mechs and other optional rules)."", ""I've played both a bunch. I really prefer star wars. \n\nEven though I play and enjoy pathfinder, star finder feels a bit wonky to me. It's almost too abstracted, and it never felt compelling to me.\n\nStar wars gives plenty of character diversity with unique ways of building characters to suit what you want.\n\nThe dice really do lend themselves well to helping build the narrative, and if your gm is game can radically change the direction of a story. The only frustration for me is I somehow manage to roll all blanks fairly often, and doing nothing on a roll really is not fun, because with the good and bad symbols something is almost always happening."", ""Star Wars: Edge of the Empire is a great system with a significant amount of splat / and player options available. It uses custom dice with symbols that provide multiple layers of results for a single check. The custom dice are probably the biggest reason the system is popular.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe custom dice are also the most popular complaint / hate point that critics have. You \\*have\\* to buy the new dice, and you'll need at least 2, probably 3 sets to be able to make most checks without much re-rolling individual dice. Note: technically you don't \\*have\\* to buy the dice. You can take normal dice and either apply stickers or convert the numbers to symbols, and then resolve the check. The stickers are a good solution if you're tight on budget. I don't ever recommend the translation approach, as it will soon become very frustrating. FFG has also released a dice app, and there are several web-based dice rollers for the custom dice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPros: A great core mechanic backed up by a large amount of published content (player options, adventures, and optional rules).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCons: The system is expensive to get into. \n\n&amp;#x200B;"", 'Depends on what your group likes. If you like combat, with meaningful and interesting character progression based on skills and  abilities, plus clear/explicit rules, you should go with Starfinder.\n\nIf you like narrative play, with rules that are more open to interpretation, and a low emphasis on combat and ""gaming,"" you should go with Star Wars.\n\nI am an avid player of both systems, but they serve completely different purposes. Starfinder, like Pathfinder, is very much based around the internal mechanics being fun to use and learn, while Star Wars is about telling a creative story with dice rolls as a vehicle for that narrative playstyle.', 'I can\'t speak to Starfinder, though I personally find Pathfinder (which Starfinder is based upon) to be too much work after a couple of levels. If your group\'s only experience is with 5E, Starfinder will be more familiar than Star Wars, but if any of your players are ""casual players"", then they might find Starfinder rather involved (assuming it is anything like Pathfinder).\n\nMy own personal preference would be for Edge of the Empire, but it\'s very much a ""love-it-or-hate-it"" type of system. Copy pasting from another post of mine:\n\nInstead of numbered dice, the game uses special dice with narrative symbols. I realize that\'s a tough sell, but it\'s absolutely worth it IMO - your stats determine how many beneficial dice you are throwing and the difficulty set by the GM gives you a certain number of difficulty dice with only negative symbols to roll. There are success and failure symbols which mean what you would expect and cancel each other out (you need a single net success to succeed), but the real genius of the system is that there are also advantage and threat symbols. Those are narrative ""side effects"" that are completely distinct from the success / failure axis, so it\'s possible for you to succeed with a nice little narrative cherry on top (success with advantage), succeed but run into an unexpected complication (success with threat), fail but with mitigating circumstances (failure with advantage), or fail AND realize that the situation is even worse than before (failure with threat). It\'s excellent for emulating pulpy back and forth Indiana Jones style combat - in Star Wars, my go to example is the blaster shot that misses your target (you got zero net successes), but the stray bolt activates the fire suppression system and your opponent is suddenly sprayed with rapidly expanding foam that is going to throw him off on his next turn (you generated a bunch of advantages).\n\nEdge of the Empire does use the Star Wars setting, obviously, but most of the careers and specialties are generic enough (colonist, pilot, bounty hunter, smuggler, etc.) to work in any generic space setting. I myself am going to be using it to run a Mass Effect game next month using Genesys (the generic version of the Star Wars system) and it would probably work just fine in Edge of the Empire as well. Just avoid having an ""empire"" and ""rebels"" and ban Jedi characters or reflavor the Force as some other type of scifi ""power"" and you would be all set!', ""If you want sci fi that isn't exactly star wars, you can get the genesys system book from fantasy flight. It's almost the exact same rules as edge of the empire, from the same company, but abstracted to fit into settings other than star wars. Most of the stuff in the star wars source books should still be compatible.\n\nI'll be another vote for stars without number. It's my personal favorite sci-fi system.\n\nYou should also look up Scum and Villainy, a newer game that relies on flashbacks and stress mechanics to tell stories about daring heists. It's closely based on the game blades in the dark. \n\nThese should all be available cheap (or in the case of SWN free) on sites like drivethruRPG "", ""Star Wars has such a simple to learn and elegant narrative dice pool system that I'm having trouble recommending anything other than it to anyone at the moment."", ""Unless you and the players are MASSIVE Star Wars fans, it's my experience that the Star Wars universe isn't that great a setting. \n\nAside from that, I personally don't like the Edge of the Empire system, as the force powers are insanely overpowered."", ""To be a hundred percent honest, I didn't really like either of those systems. I was never a fan of Pathfinder's crunchiness, it makes the game a huge pain in the ass to DM.

rpg,t3_a0h87v,"any RPGs based largely or entirely around die-drop tables?Ever since I first saw the die-drop tables in Vornheim I've been enamored with the concept, and I've tinkered on and off with the idea of making an RPG that incorporates the idea as heavily as possible.

rpg,t3_a0g66p,"Subjective Topic: Summons and limitationsHey everyone. I am working on a YuGiOh inspired RPG and as part of that it involves summoning Monsters.  

I have the core mechanics down for summoning but what I am thinking about is the limitations that should be in play.

This is things like communication, memory, senses, and range.

Currently:  
Caster and Summon can communicate telepathically  
A Summon can be up to 2 Kilometers away from the Summoner (The average distance from ground to cloud)  
And Summons remember each time they come back  

Obviously there are differences depending on the setting you are playing in but mostly I was wanting to see other peoples thoughts on this kind of topic.

You might also want to limit the number that characters can call on to a few without having to do something arduous to switch one of their roster, otherwise I could see players easily ending up with a solution monster to every problem. Limitations make it a meaningful tactical decision when choosing which summons to have on hand.\n\nIs there a limitation on how quickly you can switch out your summons, say if a player is trying to do it in the middle of combat? Is there a cooldown for how long you have to wait to call a summon again after using it? Are there limitations on how long a character can keep a summon in play? Who roleplays the summon: the GM? The Player? Is it a joint effort?']"
rpg,t3_a0fv55,"Sci-fi RPG with tactical, gamist combatI know 4th edition D&amp;D has great tactical combat (to the point of a fault, according to many). Iron Kingdoms is another game that's got pretty deep tactical combat, being based off a tabletop wargame. What are good sci-fi games with tactical combat? By that I mean minis for tactical positioning, rules that keep things dynamic and interesting, and an emphasis on gamist elements rather than simulation.

\-I know there are various modern/sci-fi takes on 4e (Gamma World, for example), but I'm more interested in something that is designed for sci-fi style combat with a focus on firearms rather than a reskin of a high fantasy system.

\-GURPS is one I see recommended frequently. Combat is a little static and simulationist for my liking, though. There aren't many rules for out-of-activation stuff, or abilities that make your character really unique in combat.

\-Savage Worlds is another one that gets recommended a lot, and is probably a good choice for this. I've heard complaints that characters feel too similar without classes, especially at higher power levels.

\-Starport Scum is one I've seen recommended in this vein, but haven't picked it up yet. Definitely on my list to check out.

\-The various Warhammer 40k RPGs seem to have an emphasis on tactical combat. How engaging are those combat systems?

\-Strike! is based on 4e with inspiration from X-COM, which should be perfect in terms of what I'm looking for. I don't really like the way the rest of the system feels bolted-on, though. The resolution mechanic for non-combat stuff seems odd to me.

\-Synthicide has grid-based tactical combat that looks really good. The setting is interesting. I've been meaning to run this. The attack roll and damage roll being combined seems a little funky to me, but I'm willing to give it a shot. Anyone tried this and want to tell me I'm crazy for worrying about that piece?

\-Forge Engine is designed for this kind of play, but the action economy/simultaneous turns seems a little dubious to me. It looks like you'd get a pretty big advantage by having high initiative, sitting still, and then waiting for a lower initiative character to move into range so you could unload on them. If anyone has experience with this system, I'd love to hear it, as it does look pretty interesting.

What am I missing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a0fv55/scifi_rpg_with_tactical_gamist_combat/,"['The 40k games are fun to read and a slog to play.', 'I keep hearing the Fragged series brought up in conversations like this.', 'Fragged Empire is a great sci fi game with tactical grid based combat.  It has deep rules for customizing your weapons and armor.  It is classless if that matters to you (just pick your skills, 4 general ones, 2 ship ones, and 2 combat ones).  As you level you gain ""traits"" which function much like ""feats"" in other games.  If you have any other specific questions I can try to answer them', 'Infinity', 'I\'d like to argue in defense of Savage Worlds ""same-y characters""\', while suggesting some science fiction setting.\n\n**Edges**  \n\nSavage Worlds leans towards fighting, and therefore almost all character have to spend some of the initial 15 skill points into Fighting and, in modern and futuristic settings, Shooting. Therefore, 5-6 points go to combat related skill, then a couple for Notice, and the rest to not combat related skills, which start the first differences between characters. A ranger would probably have Survival and Tracking, and maybe Stealth and/or Healing; the Thief should also invest in Stealth, then Lockpicking, Climbing and maybe Persuasion; Persuasion, with Streetwise, Intimidate/Provoke are skills for the Face character; and even characters totally related towards combat can make good use of Intimidate or Provoke.\n\nWhat truly enlightens the difference between characters are edges, feats that let them perform actions previously unknown, or add small but significant bonus to skills, attributes or certain actions, defining their strategy during or outside fights: a character with Sweep can attack each adjacent enemy making him able to engage multiple opponents, while a character with Iron Will (+2 to Test of Wills, like Intimidation/Provoke) can create openings and even Shake a single opponent with their words alone.\n\nHowever, the core book has 50-60 edges, and Legendary characters have leveled up 16 times: most of the time, they will pick an Edge. Some Edges are universally good (while not necessary) and easily accessible (Quick, Nerves of Steel, Elan), therefore your players will probably take them. On the other hand, not every Edge is accessible to every one: professional and power  related Edges require particular skills or arcane background. \n\nWithout setting edges, your options are limited. I suggest to pick the *Science Fiction Companions* as setting free supplement, and, while more Cyberpunk, *Interface Zero 2.0* as cool edges, gears and rulings for futuristic worlds.\n\n\n**Trappings**\n\nEdges are a mechanical differentiation. Trappings are the flavour variations (and can be used outisde the powers). \n\nAre you giving that sweet *Command* bonus to your allies because your are their leader shouting orders across the battlefield, or as a bard singing and buffing them, or with your futuristic devices?\nYes, you can *sweep* all enemies sorrounding you, how do you do that? With a mighty spin of your broadsword? With a swift stomp to the ground, creating a shockwave around you? Bashing the enemies\' heads together? \n\nAs the GM, you can decide if the trappings are also mechanical (broadsword guy always targets the torso, shockwave monk hits the legs and bashing boy must have both hands free to break heads) or only flavour/fluff. If mechanical, you can reward players letting them learn new trappings when reaching plot milestone or having rest time, without making them spend a level up on them. Or you can have the option to perform a new trapping with a -2 modifier to the roll, or by spending a Benny. \n\nCommanding bard silenced by a spell or a called shot to the mouth? Let\'s spend a Benny to let him dance to grant his bonus. Your ranger was blinded? Let him roll Tracking with his prodigious smell at -2! An *Ace* mecha pilot  may spend a Benny to notice the similarity of his robot with a spaceship, letting him apply the edge benefits to Piloting the airship.\n\n(Sorry if I went too much off topic &gt;_&lt;)\n(Edit: formatting)', 'Can you develop your point about GURPS more ? \n\nGURPS played with tactical hexes (basic vanilla rules) and a splattering of rules from the Action Exploits (optional rules) plus the setting-relevant Point Limit and Equipment(Tech Level) turns the System into a high octane fastpaced Matrix / Cowboy Bebop / Star Wars / Ghost in the Shell / Metal Gear Solid styled action scene on a dime. Without getting \'bogged down\' by simulation for the fun ""SWAT"" stuff. The Action splat series gives simple, instantly recognized tools to abstract a lot of the movie shenaningans that we take for a given in a good cinematic romp.\n\nI think you should do another eye-over on the basic tactical combat rules in the GURPS system. The almost arcadey movement rules with movement costs, the heavy emphasis on positioning, the cover mechanics, popping out of cover for snap shots, bracing weaponry, the tactical gunplay techniques, out of turn readied attacks. Controlling hexes and the battlefield with out of turn suppression mechanics and much more. Bouncing grenades around corners, explosions, breaching charges against walls, collateral damage and building hazards.

*ToD* is a Ravenloft module featuring mummies in a pseudo-Egyptian setting. The module is called *Touch of Death* because mummies are noted for their touch attack, which inflicts a wicked case of the cooties. This module has strengths and weaknesses. The dungeon is pretty good, but the ""plot"" does not involve the PCs enough.

It\'s the less is more approach - in that the more PC focused plot you provide, the more railroading is being suggested.  The modules were generally just providing the tedious busy work (basic dungeon design, stats, a bare bones plot regarding the setting).  But I guess to modernize ToD, you could put in a suggested PC focused plot.\n\nI think that including a pc-focused plot is helpful for both newbies and in general groups that like to play railroaded games.  I know when I was beginning to GM in the ADnD days, a lot of those old modules like Keep on the Borderlands made absolutely no sense to me.  I needed very straightforward adventures to help me learn the basics.  And even though included plots can be quite railroady, GMs and players have to start somewhere to learn the building blocks.  Sure nowadays a lot of us experienced groups will be like ""who needs plots in the module?...just give me tools!"", but I think it\'s easy to forget that any game might be a group\'s first.']"

rpg,t3_a0f0kj,What should I use to run a flexible urban fantasy campaign?Hey all. I'm running a flexible RP in which players create their own supernatural creature to play as. Is there a pre-existing system that supports the insane flexibility and power array that would require?

That means that the ideal system would allow for tactical thinking while not getting bogged down in huge mechanical blatherings.,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a0f0kj/what_should_i_use_to_run_a_flexible_urban_fantasy/,"['Mutants and Masterminds sounds like what you want.

I'm already using the recommended steadtler lumocolor OHP wet-erase markers, but... It seems somewhat contradictory to have such a huge mat to NOT be able to leave the ink overnight, it's too much work to do the entire thing again for next day or even week.

For those of you who use vinyl mats, if you leave the ink over night is it difficult to remove?

A success means that your character does the thing to their intent, but if you don\'t succeed, you activate a ""twist"", which is effectively a AW-style Hard Move that lets the GM take narrative control.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn combat, your character is comprised of a combination of ""class"" and ""role"". Your class, like Archer or Duelist, defines your fundamental attacks, and your role, like Defender or Striker, defines how they fit in with your team. The combination of the two can make some very fun MOBA-esque combat kits: a Duelist-Defender plays a lot like, say, Shen: they like to lock down one or two enemies and prevent them from going anywhere. Meanwhile, a Duelist-Striker can be a highly mobile assassin like Fiora or Master Yi; they can burst down an enemy and be wherever they want to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe noncombat/combat duality of Strike seems to mesh pretty well with the slice-of-life/supernatural combat aspect of your game premise, actually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe nice thing about Strike is that it\'s actually generic: an Archer can be a gunner or a mage or...well, an actual archer. This should let your players flavor their attacks in any way that makes sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you\'d like I could attempt to build a character for this premise as an example...', ""Magical Burst is a Japanese d66 game that I think has free rules. It's centered around episodic play with cinematic fights. It's a little like a proto PbtA game with more emphasis on the enemy encounters and a little less on interpersonal dramas. Though that's still in there too. \n\nIt also has a fairly fun random character generator that's fun to roll on if you're stuck for ideas or just want to make something kind of ridiculous for a laugh around the table.

rpg,t3_a09mbv,"Music for a modern Superhero / Vigilante campaign.Hey there, I'm planning on running a Superhero campaign that's set in a modern setting (Current year, maybe about 10 years in the future) which is focused on the players being street level vigilantes.

Normally I use Spotify to create some playlists for the games I run but I have trouble getting the right genres and themes for the game. 

Most modern songs are either to distinct/distracting and movie soundtracks are often too orchestral and epic to fit the dark alley hero theme.

rpg,t3_a07nq3,"Oxybe plays Call of Cthulu and loses his first PCwe had been playing for some time now and while we had some bumps, scrapes and slight psychological trauma to show for it, we were in pretty good condition, having only lost one character due to a player moving out of province, considering the system we played.

Our group of 1930's investigators consists of a french-canadian mechanic, an irish vagrant-come-janitor (me), a new england beat cop &amp; an insurance auditor.

we had been investigating the disappearance of a couple of professors at the big and famous university I janitored at, who went missing on an archeological dig. My character knew them, the cop was the one put on to investigate the case, the auditor was there to check the site and report damages claims, while the mechanic was friends with me (usually driving me around town) and a reporter doing a piece on the case (who's player had moved out of town mid campaign, and thus will not be mentionned anymore).

so we started the session picking up from the last week, in media res: a group of toughs led by the local self-proclaimed sheriff are blocking our passage from a dirt road (we had gone to ask questions about the missing profs to the local bootleggers who owned the land they were excavating).

the sheriff seemed ok at the start, but his cagey and lackadaisical attitude towards some of the goings on got our attention, and when he locked away two frendlies who had been near some otherworldly happenings (a farmwife and her son, who's husband/father got disemboweled by what i can only describe as ""the boar from princess mononoke"") we had our suspicions he might just be trying to cover things up, but at this point we realize that he is not our friend as he's pointing a loaded shotgun our way with an armed posse who we suspect may not like our snooping either.

with the party split into two vehicles, myself with the mechanic and the auditor with the beat cop, we each make a decision independently: beat cop tries to burst through the makeshift blockade while we gun it in reverse and try to make it to the heavily armed bootleggers.

i say try to make it. while the beat cop does plow through the blockade, we... well we largely manage to back away off the dirt road, jump the ditch, tear down the fence and barrel backside of the truck into the corn fields at full speed. Clutching my rosary, i say Hail Mary and hold on for dear life as the mechanic drives blindly in reverse. 

As the mechanic continues to (mostly) blindly drive backwards, something catches my eye: a misshapen, grotesque form that manages to keep up with our (slowed down) speed, flitting in and among the corn stalks.

I make the sanity check, but still lose a point. tightening my grip on the rosary I speed up repeating my Hail Mary's like a good irish catholic. Mechanic takes offense at this, thinking it a commentary on his driving.

Hitting a hole in the ground, our tuck immediately stops and the wretch catches up to us, jumps on the hood of the truck and unleashes an inhuman howl as hoards or mice, rats and insects descend on us, coming out of the fields, biting and tearing at whatever exposed flesh they can. 

now, we're not D&amp;D PCs: we're CoC investigators. those pests make painful work of the mechanic who dies to the hundreds of bites the foul rodents inflict as they swarm the truck's cabin through the open windows, before he can even fire off a shot from his ""driving gun"", a pistol he kept in his glovebox from his time overseas as a WW1 mechanic. My own character, by luck of the RNG granting me a comparatively nicer hit point pool, survives the first attack, but knows he's not going to survive the next. he can't get out of the truck, fight off the swarm and escape both it and it's master on foot. 

He realizes he's going to die.

But Liam MacAlear survived the last 52 years on prayer, whiskey and being as tough as leather. there is no doubt in his terrified mind he's going out, but it's on his terms and he's sending this thing back to Old Scratch, express delivery.

I've been hauled around town enough to know the contents of the mechanic's truck as though it belonged to me. Liam and the mechanic were good friends. Grabbing the mechanic's pistol I reach into the back of the truck, that space between the seats and the back of the cab and shove it's muzzle into a small wooden crate that's been sitting in the back of the truck since session 1, when the mechanic bought the dynamite to clear debris but ended up just not using it.

""Hail mary, full 'o grace..."".

And that's how I lost my first Call of Chulhu character, and the first two character deaths of the campaign.

rpg,t3_a05q14,"DCC RPG Kickstarter 24 hours leftI wanted to post about a Kickstarter that is about to end for people who may or may not have heard about the great game Dungeon Crawl Classics. It's in and out of print and can be hard to find in every game store. However here's a few things I think are worthwhile in [this Kickstarter.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1409961192/dcc-annual-and-other-forbidden-tomes/description)

\- Core Rulebook for a great OSR and Appendix N inspired fantasy/scifi roleplaying game that is focused on rulings and not rules with a fun Gonzo rule system for magic. Beyond that, there is a TON of great fantasy art in the book which is worth the price of admission in my opinion. 

\- DCC RPG Annual is a much anticipated expansion on the core rules. You don't have to back it if you don't want but there is bound to be a lot of great art and inspirational material if you're at all interested in the system. Goodman Games released the original rulebook in 2012 I believe and this is the first content expansion they've done outside of modules. The fact they've supported an RPG this long without relying on splat books makes this an instant buy for me. I don't think they would be releasing this if it weren't honestly an impressive addition to the game content.

\- DCC Chained Coffin module hardcover is what amounts to a mini adventure setting in the Shudder Mountains with an Appalachian folklore inspiration. Your adventuring group finds a Chained Coffin with a person trapped inside that wants you to take them back to the Shudder Mountains for unseen purposes. This is a very different setting for sword and sorcery adventures that I am personally really excited to explore. This material would be great inspirational reading for any setting not just DCC RPG. The reviews are quite overwhelmingly positive and a bonus is that there is a physical puzzle for players to solve included with the adventure. How cool is that!?

\- 5 bonus adventures to anybody backing any of the books in the Kickstarter PLUS an additional module for every book you back. You'll get to pick the 5 from a pool I believe, although the book number dependent ones may be random, and from what I've played and read, the DCC RPG modules are very high caliber for inclusion in any ongoing campaign or frequently can be run as one-two shots. Same as above for great inspirational reading if nothing else. I especially enjoy all of the modules by Harley Stroh. 

 \- $2 DCC RPG Starter rules can pique your interest with minimal investment. I picked them up before this Kickstarter and it was a great way to get new people interested in the game without having to force them though the whole rule book. Highly recommended.


I just wanted to post about this and let anybody who may be interested out there know there's still a day left to get any or all of these cool things and I think the folks at Goodman Games deserve the love.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/a04k1e/is_osr_just_a_branding_label_at_this_point/,"['Has it ever been anything other than a bunch of loosely associated products? I don\'t think there was ever a unified set of ""OSR"" rules or standards.', ""I'd say it's more of a style and movement of fantasy RPG play that has sometimes competing philosophies. If used in conjunction with certain logos then it's more of a branding label with some games falling more under the brand than others."", 'You would be better served by asking this question in /r/osr\n\n""What is the OSR"" is asked often.\n\nLeading questions like yours however are often wrong. Much about calling a product OSR is branding. But it has almost nothing to do with OSR communities, OSR play styles, nor design sensibilities of the creators who gather together, play test each other\'s work, and encourage others to also create.', 'It\'s more like an art movement than anything else. There are certain markers that make something seem more OSR, but there isn\'t any firm boundaries on what counts and what doesn\'t, and there isn\'t any centralized authority gatekeeping it.\n\nIn my personal opinion, the more of the following a campaign has, the more old school it is: high lethality, an open sandbox world, a lack of pre-written plot, an emphasis on creative problem solving, an exploration-centered reward system (usually XP for treasure), a disregard for ""encounter balance"", the use of random tables to generate world elements that surprise both players and referees, a strong do-it-yourself attitude and a willingness to share your work and use the creativity of others in your game.\n\nIn other words, I see it more as a playstyle than a ruleset. [The Principia Apocrypha](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html) fleshes that out more.', 'OSR originated as a scant few pillars of play style:\n\n\n* Rulings, Not Rules\n* Player Skill, not Character Abilities\n* Heroic, not Superhero\n* Forget “Game Balance”\n\nBut has virally evolved into whatever anyone wants it to be so they can consider themselves on or off the OSR bandwagon.  It was supposed to espouse classical roleplaying principles but has taken on a subtext of recoiling from so-called ""narrative"" style games and further distant ""storytelling"" games.\n', 'Yes.', ""One could probably ask the same question about PtbA or Open D6.\n\nRegardless, it's pretty cool we have a few systems under the OGL that can be used as a creative outlet for so many amazing people. I don't care what logos the creator slaps on their books. I only care about what's inside.\n\nIts like trying to separate the fantasy books from the sci-fi ones at the bookstore. They're so cross-genre now it's better just to read them than to figure out where they belong."", 'I can only speak to my own thoughts on the current state of the \'OSR\' and why I call it a brand. To do so I think it\'s important to recognize that there\'s more then one \'OSR\'.\n\n1) First there\'s a body of design principles and ethics of play - such as the Principia Apocrypha and Finch\'s classic primer contain. These principles and ethics are often tied to mechanics - back in 2011 or so a lot of these mechanics were being rediscovered (though people never stopped playing with them) and codified based on 1980\'s RPGs - mostly D&amp;D. A lot more new things since. There\'s nothing that says the design principles and ethical practices (or play goals and style if you want to simplify) have to be played using older editions of D&amp;D.  Mechanics for exploring dangerous environments with high levels of risk/reward and minimal rules can be applied to almost any system. \n\n2) The aesthetics of the \'OSR\' - Emerging with or shortly after the design principles was a set of aesthetics. A lot of the \'OSR\' was originally interested in emulating the classic feel of 80\'s D&amp;D and it\'s implied setting - orcs &amp; goblins, but subtly different from the 4E - 5E high fantasy \'dungeon superhero\' aesthetic.  More important to the \'OSR\' though was a group of bloggers diverging from classic fantasy and focusing settings/aesthetics of: Weird Fiction/Science Fantasy, Heavy Metal/Horror imagery and/or Sword\'s and Sorcery setting building. This has continued and grows more and more distinctive as multiple sets of setting aesthetics.  Obviously there\'s nothing that says this needs to be linked in any way to the design principles or ethics of play described above.  Torchbearer would be an example - it\'s a unified mechanic narrative game that tries to emulate the aesthetics of a classic dungeon crawl.  \n\n3) There\'s the \'OSR\' as a community - coming into existence around G+ and the ease of online play there.  It is/was also a community of bloggers, artists and designers  often collaborating together.  \n\n---------------------\nThe brand part comes in now - 5 to 7 years later when the community has grown unmanageable and is shot through with bad elements, creating ugliness and generally dragging the name of the \'OSR\' through the mud.  There\'s factions, fission and fighting in the \'OSR\' community, largely because it has grown big and broken. \n\nThe problem here is that as the community decays the goodwill and reputation it\'s created is being nibbled away at and replaced with ideas like ""The OSR is Mr. X\'s thing"" or ""The OSR is for angry old men that hate gay people"".   Neither of these are true of the vast majority of the \'OSR\', but these beliefs grow, examples pop up, and makes less people (myself included) want to associate with the \'OSR\'.\n\nThere\'s also people who are looking to that community to make money - inexplicably they see hobby publication in tabletop as a source of income and fame - or at least pocket money and a bit of praise.  Some make good stuff, a lot don\'t, and you have the terrible ""orcs in a hole"" adventures that have grasped more or less the mechanical preoccupations of old school play or the ""Deadly Railroad"" adventures where there\'s some aesthetic elements that a commonly viewed as \'OSR\', but built without understanding the mechanics, principles or ethics and most often falling back on design principles suited for tactical combat RPGs. Both of these sorts of products are all over RPGnow and end up giving tenfootpole.org regular moments of sadness.  This isn\'t to say that there aren\'t great things being produced by people who associate with the OSR - but there\'s a lot of dreck, and it\'s usually asking for money to get it.  This is one aspect of the \'OSR\' as a brand - people slapping the label onto something to garner sales via the goodwill or reputation that the older community has.  Like all inferior knockoff products it\'s diminishing the brand\'s value rapidly.\n\nA combination of an unhealthy community and crass commercialization (not saying don\'t publish your stuff and make money - just saying publish good stuff if you ask for money and consider how much stuff that\'s better is free) make it a bad place to play or design rules lite classic fantasy tabletop stuff.  At least for me.\n\nThat set of design principles, play ethos and aesthetics though - you can take those anywhere and have a lot of fun with them.  By leaving behind the community (expect for people one wants to work and play with) and ditching the label or brand of the \'OSR\' one gets to discuss classic dungeoncrawl mechanics or weird fantasy aesthetics with the wider RPG community, and by splitting everything into it\'s components rather then a single \'OSR\' package off multiple principles one can talk much more easily about what can be added or subtracted from other play styles without the same sort of conflict - E.G. I can ask ""How would risk/reward site exploration or resource management look in 5E?"" without also having to answer for Pundit\'s politics or justify elves being a class. ', 'Someone noticed that they were seeing that a lot of people who had gotten away from older games and older playstyles were rediscovering them. That some of these people were creating new material for the old games and sharing/selling it. That some people were creating new games heavily inspired by the older games &amp; older playstyles.\n\nIt seemed appropriate to call this an “old school renaissance”.\n\nAnyone saying that the term has ever been more than that is, IMHO, reading way too much into it.\n\n(I mean, I’m the first to argue that “role-playing game” has always had a meaning separate from the sum of its parts. But I’ve never felt the same was true of OSR.)', 'A lot of people in here are debating what the definition of ""old school"" or even ""Old School Renaissance"" is, but I think that misses the broader point behind the ""it\'s just a branding label"" comment.\n\nThe OSR started as a grassroots community in a handful of blogs and forums interested in revisiting the way they had played games when they were younger. (And which some ""grognards"" had never stopped playing.) It became a Renaissance when people began doing more than just revisiting those ideas and instead began to re-explore them and create new things from them.\n\nPersonally, I believe that the OSR is at its best when it is, in fact, a Renaissance: When it explores, experiments with, and creates new things from the paths the mainstream RPG industry didn\'t follow. The earliest RPGs were a tangled morass of new, exciting, and often confused ideas as both the community and the original creators grappled with the possibilities of what they\'d created. The industry went one way, increasingly wedded to larger rulebooks; encyclopedic settings; linear scenarios. But there were other options that were left on the table.\n\nWhen it comes to the OSR today, however, that grassroots community as sort of withered away and been replaced with a plethora of hobby publishers. The OSR seems less focused on throwing ideas around and more focused on releasing monthly products and running successful Kickstarters. That\'s what people are talking about when they talk about the ""branding label"".', 'It\'s the rpg equivalent of ""organic"".\n\n&amp;#x200B;', 'It always has been.', 'I love OSR styled games, but I don\'t like saying OSR in these public forums unless I need to specify.  The reason is a selfish one and probably not really worth anything.  But I feel like it\'s talking about a fad diet.  \n\n""How do you know someone is on *insert fad diet*, they\'ll tell you.""\n\nAlso I feel that the term OSR has grown to encompass so much more than the traits I feel are within it, that the term is now meaningless at least for me.  It\'s like saying Action RPG to describe a video game.  The only people who would find the term useful are the ones who already know about it, and the ones who don\'t know about it probably associate it with something horrible since bad news always floats to the top.', 'It just means ""D&amp;D from back when we had no idea what we were doing"".\n\n', 'Paging /u/DungeonOfSigns...', 'It always was.']"

rpg,t3_a01wvd,"Chaotic D20 (I wrote this in, like, 2 hours)Chaotic D20 – Core Rules

First off: The fact that this rule book exists kinda goes against the spirit of Chaotic D20: There are no rules. Well, at least not many. The game is designed for short campaigns and maximum chaos. However, to ensure the group has at least some idea on what to do, here a few... ""suggestions"":

Basic Rules

In Chaotic D20, everything is decided by rolling the D20. EVERYTHING.

Here's the gist of it: The setting is entirely up to the GM's imagination. Drop 'em into the middle of an ISIS camp for all I care. The same freedom, however, is afforded to the players, who are completely free to write the most insane garbage they can come up with on their character sheets. That is, until it comes to determining the stats.

To determine the stats, roll 6xD20, then divide by 4 (rounding down). Then distribute the results among the following stats:

• Strength

• Dexterity

• Constitution

• Intelligence

• Wisdom

• Charisma

These numbers determine the number of chances the character gets to roll higher than the target value (arbitrarily) set by the GM when performing an action. A zero means there is literally no chance for the character to even attempt the action, a one means they have a disadvantage, in other words, need to roll twice and take the lesser result, while all other values are simply the allowed number of tries +1 (2 → 1 roll, 4 → 3 rolls). The number of Hit Points for the character are simply Constitution x4, unless Constitution is zero, in which case they get one HP per default. THERE IS NO LEVEL UP.

Now you wonder how your characters will learn new abilities, and hey, where the hell did all the sub stats like Deception or Athletics go? NONE OF THAT MATTERS IN CHAOTIC D20.

In Chaotic D20, a player can simply say that they will try to do something. It's up to the GM then to decide a target value that has to be surpassed with the best D20 throw allowed by the most fitting stat to that action. The maximum target value that is recommended, though, is 18, reserving 19 and 20 as a grace space for the most insane, unrealistic ideas.

If an action is taken against a character, they can also resist following the same rules, their target value being determined by the roll of the offending party.

If a successful action has taken place that results in damage against a certain character, divide the best allowed value of the success roll by 4 (rounding down) and have the attacking character roll as many times as the resulting value would prescribe as a stat. The best allowed value is then applied as damage to the other character. If a character's health reaches 0, they're dead as f\*ck. THIS CAN EASILY ONE SHOT ANY POSSIBLE CHARACTER, SO DON'T GROW TOO ATTACHED TO THEM.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Example Actions

&amp;#x200B;

Milli is a cybernetic Japanese anime loli girl that was farted into the 3rd dimension by secret Illuminati high priest Jeb Bush, trying to put a stop to an epic mecha robot fight between a resurrected Joseph Stalin and a potato farmer named Bob on the streets of Dubai. Her strength is a 2, which means average. The player tells the GM “I'm gonna rip the Burj Khalifa out of the ground and use it as a giant baseball bat to send Stalin flying into the sun.” The GM, let's assume, holds strongly enough to reason that he sets the target value for this to be 18. The player rolls a 19. In a baffling motion, Milli jumps up half a mile into the air, grabs the Burj Khalifa by a TV antenna, rips it out of the ground, and after Stalin fails to score a 20 on his dexterity defense attempt, she hits a home run. With her 19 on the success roll, she now rolls the D20 3 times, resulting in 18 damage being applied to Stalin as determined by her highest result, killing him instantly.

&amp;#x200B;

Geoffrey is the ghost of a British nobleman from Elizabethan times possessing a Vacuum Flask. He needs to quickly cool down the reactor of an interstellar cruise ship. Luckily, he has the password he needs to gain access to the critical computer systems. Now, to type it in...

Burning Sky Pt1 (A Divinity Card Tale)

Skye  ran from the  burning factory, flashing drones chasing her mere steps  behind. Her new  friends, whom she had only decided to trust a few hours  ago, were  arrayed along the rooftops, just as she had planned.

Bolts  of  plasma fizzled out on the ground ahead of her as the drones tried  to  find their marks, but she continued on stoically. This was the only   option if she was to continue living as herself. She could not stop,  she  could not surrender... even though she  wanted to so badly in her  heart, she could not show fear in this moment.  This was the trial of  her destiny.

To distract herself, she  thought back to how this all started, one day  on a cliff in a forest,  the being in the sky calling out to her,  offering her a destiny above  mere existence. It was folly she had  decided then, and she still  believed now, though she had indeed found a  destiny beyond that of  anything she had dreamed in her life as a  forester. Hunting with her  Hawk, Xavi, and avoiding the patrols of  citymen was all she had to do  growing up.  Citymen were scary, she had  been taught, with their  machines and metal-fused bodies. They had gone  too far and embraced  addictive technology to the point of no return.

That  was what she had been taught, and yet, these new friends, they  were  not evil. She did not trust the power they had all been given, she   could already see its addictive quality starting to take the mind of one   of her fellows, but she trusted them tacitly. Together they had stood   against a man whose greed would strike the world aflame today, and she   knew their adventures were only beginning.

Skye  looked up and saw  Saphira blasting the drones with lightning, as  Chimera blasted at them  with seemingly magical explosions. Skye knew  that this was the result of  the Card Chimera had recently gained. She  had used it to record the  explosion of a prototype grenade 30 minutes  earlier, and could now  reproduce that explosion at will. Marri jumped  from her perch and struck  a drone that had just nearly passed Skye,  slicing it in two.

""Go,"" she said softly,  readying her sword. Skye ran from the fight a few  more feet, and  paused when she saw a guardsman closing their escape  gate. With a  whisper of apology to God, she raised her bow and fired,  the arrow  striking true between the man's shoulder blades.

""We should run,"" she yelled to her friends.  
""Not yet!"" Chimera yelled back, ""We haven't found the last card! ""  
""We don't need more power we need to go! I cant hold this gate forever,"" Skye growled  
""She's right,"" Saphira chimed in, ""Any minute now police will be here and they wont take our side""  
""With more power, none of that would matter,"" Chimera grumbled as she nevertheless prepared to run.  
""I'll hold the rear,"" Marri stated calmly, ""Lets go.""

END PART ONE

Burning Sky pt2 (A Divinity Card Tale)

Saphira  had never  considered herself a fighter, but she found herself fighting  now. A  horde of drones and guards, crackling with electricity she  herself had  wrought. An army brought low by her power. It was  endearing; seductive,  even. But she had self control enough to handle  that for now.

Her father had never taught  her to use the sword that killed him, but  she carried it with her now,  along with the Card they had been seeking.  No tears fell as she  remember him falling, slowly, through the night air. No tears: she would  remember him fondly.

Her sword slashed  through the wind with abandon, a smile on her lips  and a bounce in her  step, the sword would mourn for him instead.

""Lets  go,"" her new friend, Marri, said softly, placing a hand on her  back.  She had joined these people because they were kind, and friendly,  and  because of this, Saphira had agreed to make their enemy her own.  This  Omega corporation... they had done unspeakable things in the search  of  the power that she held now in her hands. The same power that could   change the world. She would master it.

Passing  Skye, Saphira ran  ahead destroying the chain holding the gate shut  with a strike of her  sword, and fled to the darkness. As vehicles came  from afar, flashing  lights indicating police, she looked back to see a  flame-wreathed man  descending from the sky at sonic speed. With a  massive shake, he  arrived, spreading fire and shockwaves at her  friends.

""No!!""  
Not again. Never  again. Saphira raised her sword high, calling  lightning from above, and  with scream worthy of her element, she brought  it crashing down into  her foe.

Smoldering, he stood, still alive, annoyed.  
""You won't get another chance,"" he growled, charging.

Saphira had eyes only for her friends, looking to their rising. As they stood, she smiled once more, ""I wont need one.""

END PART 2

Burning Sky pt3 (A Divinity Card Tale)

Marri  stood, the blast  had singed her, but she was more worried about Skye  and Chimera, who  were not as conditioned to pain as herself. The man  stood not 10 feet  away, charging at Saphira, who locked Marri's eyes  momentarily and  smiled.

She knew what  Saphira wanted her to do, but first she  looked to the others, and,  seeing that they were at least breathing and  staring at her as well,  Marri flew into combat.

The man wielded  flames and could fly or was dropped from a great  height.. Marri was  armed with a holy sword granted to her on that  fateful day when destiny  flew into her hands, carried on the winds of  divinity. All she had to  do was close the distance before he looked  behind himself.

Marri  thought back to that day. She had been  training her pet tiger for his  next circus act, and had plans later to  go out with her friends, a  party she had organised. When the light  blasted through the tent, and  that being began to speak, she knew He was  talking to her. The voice  was heard across the world, and yet still she  knew. The Card bestowed  upon her a weapon, the name on its blade;  Gratiam Linguae. This weapon  took her voice but bestowed upon her a  greater destiny. Her friends  were still here, in the trees. Her tiger,  Petru, larger now and capable  producing steam from his very skin, lay  with them.

Now  was the moment. She was nearly there; the back of  her enemy was mere  meters away. With a mighty cry she smote him down at  the same moment he  released his flame upon Saphira. Her roar turned to  an anguished cry  as she saw her friend fall aflame.

Raising  her  sword high, it sent the signal to her comrades, who rushed from  the  trees to ferry her friends to safety. Petru arrived as well, and as  she  mounted atop him, she realized her family had grown, but her   responsibilities had grown even more.

END PART 3

Burning Sky pt4 (A Divinity Card Tale)

Chimera  was not the  type to turn away from a task, so it was with regret that  she followed  her friends as they attempted an escape from this  facility. Still, they  had achieved their initial objective- retrieving  the Card they knew to  be held here. She could feel in her bones that  there was ore power to be  found however, and couldn't shake off this  feeling as she stood from  the blast that had winded her and prepared to  charge after her team.

Suddenly a  heavenly light shot up from the facility behind her, the  central  building halo'd by white and a noise of unearthly force. She had  to  turn back, there was no other path that would satisfy her.  She  needed  more. More power, for safety, for respect, for forgiveness, and  mercy,  for what she'd done, and for the trials she knew would follow her   always.

The light seemed to call to her,  almost. Though  the  sound of her friends calling to her in desperation  seemed increasingly  distant, this sound was pure, and close. So  close...

And then  light was all she  could see, and she was in the sky, looking sown at her  foes and  friends, locked in a struggle beneath her. They could be  beneath her  always, the voice said, she could transcend this world, and  become one  with the universe if she would just relinquish these paltry  ideals of  honor and loyalty that she strived for constantly. Its not  like she had  ever lived up to her ideals, she should be able to drop  them easily,  they were only ever burdens, after all.

When  she  saw Saphira burned, and Marri bravely strike down the foe, she  felt  nothing. Nor did Chimera care when Skye shot her bow at a  policeman's  vehicle to buy the evacuation team time to mount up the  wounded among  her friends. None of these mattered...

No.  What was she thinking?  Those men and women down there, they were her  only friends, the only  ones who had trusted her, ever, the only people  whom she knew she could  rely on and trust. And that would always mean  something.

Chimera stood upon the earth, and she wept. How dare the demons of this world torment her this way. She would make them pay.

Right after she caught up with her friends.

The core mechanics are fairly traditional though and a lot of the setting specific stuff could be stripped out.  The Ark development rules, for example, could be dropped completely.  Mutant powers are somewhat coupled to the core resolution mechanic, with pushing roles being the primary way of  generating mutant points.  However it sounds like you might be okay with using the included mutant powers, so that shouldn\'t be a problem.  You could probably create your own custom mutation powers without too much trouble.\n\nMYZ has a set of classes to choose from.  They\'re not quite as central as D&amp;D classes or AW playbooks, but they\'re pretty important.  If you weren\'t satisfied with the core set, you might have to do some work to create your own.  The classes are Zone Stalker, Fixer, Gearhead, Chronicler, Dog handler, Enforcer, Boss, and Slave.  Each class has some prewritten options for character relationships and names, similar to AW, but those can easily be replace.  More importantly each class has a specialist skill and specific talents that are core to their class.  Some of these skills have setting specific assumptions and it would take some effort to come up with new ones.\n\nMYZ assumes the PCs will do a large amount of traveling and exploring the wasteland.  If your not planning a lot of traveling and exploring in your campaign, you could probably still use the core rules, but you\'d be missing out on a lot of what makes MYZ great.  MYZ also assumes the PCs will be dealing with a decent amount of radiation or ""Rot"".  If that isn\'t a big thing in your campaign, you could probably cut it out without too much impact.\n\nThere is a lot of setting and metaplot content in the game.

rpg,t3_a008b9,"How I'm eliminating perception rollsI've got a problem with perception rolls. Like many GMs I grossly overuse it. So here are some of the things I'm doing to fix it. 

**Searching**

Searching is now mostly position based. If your model is near a secret and you say you are searching then you find it. 

The amount of time spent determines if you find tricky stuff like false bottomed drawers. (And really, you will find them because it drives the plot. )

**Surprise**

Unless the enemy is actively using stealth, if your character is on watch he will see the enemy with plenty of time to sound a warning. And usually the watch will have an advantage due to terrain. 

This makes ambusing a lot more feasible. 

**When to roll then?**

1. When the roll is contested. i.e. stealth vs perception 
2. When the player doesn't ask. 

Allow me to explain. A high perception character should notice things when they aren't looking. They see the slightly ajar desk drawer that they hadn't even thought to check. They feel someone sneaking up behind while focusing on the letter they are reading.

I decided to do this after rewatching the Lord of the Rings movies and thinking how cool it was that characters like Legolas and Strider always knew/sensed things. That contrasted heavily with a game I ran a few years back where a character with knowledge of ""Local History"" managed to roll low every time it came up. What I\'m doing is basically this..\n\nIf you have a skill, you are in a place where it could be used to know something, and you say you are using it: you get the major clue/information that is available there. You can still roll to try and find more or more details about the clue you found. an example:\n\n*GM: ""You come across the grizzly scene of a battle.

If there’s a secret drawer in a table and they’re searching the table I’ll give them some clues to find the table.

If your model is near a secret and you say you are searching then you find it. \n&gt;\n&gt;The amount of time spent determines if you find tricky stuff like false bottomed drawers. (And really, you will find them because it drives the plot. )\n\nPlayers walk to every space to a room and search in every room. Nothing is hidden unless there is a time constraint for being in a room and searching takes actual real time', 'You need to think carefully about the kind of gameplay you want to create. Think about how these rules will actually play out - literally imagine the situations at the table and what people will be saying.\n\n&gt;The amount of time spent determines if you find tricky stuff like false bottomed drawers.\n\nIs there often a reason why they wouldn\'t just spend the maximum amount of time? Will this rule, in practice, actually mean much?\n\nMaybe instead: you only need to roll if you\'re under time pressure.\n\nIf you roll random encounters when players search, go with: you can search fast and roll, or you can do a thorough search, but I\'ll roll a random encounter.\n\n&gt; (And really, you will find them because it drives the plot. )\n\nIf you need them to find these things, why are you creating failure conditions? You\'re setting yourself up with rules that you already know you\'re going to need to fudge.\n\nAnd if you need the PCs to do certain things to drive the plot, are they really playing the game or are they just acting out a story you pre-wrote for them? When you need rolls to go a certain way, that\'s usually a warning sign. OSR play that uses a lot of active searching loves to hide interesting stuff in missable locations, but it also largely avoids pre-written plots. This isn\'t a coindence.\n\n&gt;Unless the enemy is actively using stealth, if your character is on watch he will see the enemy with plenty of time to sound a warning. And usually the watch will have an advantage due to terrain. \n\nThis is a good rule of thumb. This is a pretty common way to deal with encounters that happen while under watch. Unless someone is sneaking up, if they approach you, you see them, just like you don\'t need to roll Perception to notice a chair at the table in front of you.\n\n&gt;A high perception character should notice things when they aren\'t looking. They see the slightly ajar desk drawer that they hadn\'t even thought to check. They feel someone sneaking up behind while focusing on the letter they are reading. \n\nBe very careful about this. There\'s a tradition of these kinds of rolls even before the advent of passive Perception with things like elves and chances to spot secret doors, and it makes a certain amount of sense, but it also encourages player passivity when your other rules require active searching. If they get used to passive checks, they won\'t make active checks (especially if they\'re already used to a lot of passive checks, which it sounds like they are given that you said you feel you overuse Perception checks).\n\nConsiderting the things passive Perception can find. The elf secret door thing works well because players know that they still need to actively search since the passive will *only* find secret doors (and the chance isn\'t great either).\n\nHere is what I would consider instead:\n\n1. Unless there is time pressure, searching a room will always succeed.\n\n  If using random encounters: choosing not to do a rushed search (with time pressure) risks attracting unwanted attention.\n\n2. If there is time pressure, pick a location and search. If you\'re adjacent to it, you just find it, no roll needed.\n\n  If not adjacent, either you don\'t find it or you roll. Maybe make that a feat or ability: normally you don\'t find things if you\'re not adjacent, but a feat lets you roll Perception during rushed searches to find even non-adjacent things.\n\n3. PCs don\'t need to roll Perception to see things that aren\'t hidden. Their eyes and ears work.\n\n4. Roll passive Perception checks when a PC couldn\'t reasonably think to ask for an active roll.\n\n  If someone is sneaking up on you, you get a passive Perception roll because you can\'t reasonably know when to check on that and we don\'t want to bog the game down with players saying ""I roll to see if someone\'s sneaking up on me"" every five seconds just in case. If they\'re traveling in the forest (meaning they can\'t really say ""I search the room"") and you have something hidden, maybe off in the distance even, that they couldn\'t reasonably think to ask about, give them a passive roll.\n\n5. Consider adding feats or class or race abilities or something else in the system that clearly delineates the ability to notice *particular things* passively. Do not make this a general ability for everyone or high-Perception characters. Maybe elves have a 1/6 chance to passively spot hidden doors. Maybe rogues get a 1/2 chance to spot hidden compartments passively. Be very clear about the probability, and don\'t apply a varying DC to it - players need to know that there is a 5/6 chance they *won\'t* spot the hidden door without looking actively. They need to know how useful it is to actively search for something when they didn\'t find something passively.\n\n  Unless your system gives passive perks for reaching certain skill levels already, I would not give high Perception characters passive rolls that low do not get. Perception is already a powerful skill, and you don\'t need to give it a special threshold passive effect that other skills don\'t afford. If your system has something like feats, consider creating a feat that requires a relatively high Perception and grants passive perception (with the above caveats). If you really wanted to tie it to Perception level, I might do something like: a feat with a Perception skill requirement that gives you a 1/6 chance to automatically spot any hidden thing that has a DC up to five higher than your Perception skill (or whatever number makes sense). That way the player is still clear on the probability and on what particular things it will spot and it\'s a feat rather than the Perception skill just arbitrarily working differently than other skills.', ""As someone with a uncanny ability to roll Nat 1's on perception this sounds like heaven."", 'I\'m not a DM- so feel free to correct me if this doesn\'t follow DM-side rules, but after playing so many perception-focused games, I had an idea recently regarding these rolls:\n\nChange the difficulty of the perception roll based on the difficulty/specificity of the search action.\n\nSo ""I search the alleyway"" might be normal difficulty, ""I search the alleyway for footprints"" might decrease the difficulty by 1 or 2.\n\nThings that would be very specific or easy to search for would also have lower difficulty. ""I search the alleyway for a large pothole"" might be a -3 or -4 to the difficulty- because it\'s easier to find a single, large pothole than it would be to find footprints.\n\nThen if you were to, say, roll for whether or not there\'s dirt in the pothole, and if the dirt has a footprint- than by \'chunking\' those perception rolls into easier steps, it\'s easier to get an intended result.\n\nAnd, as an added bonus, this all flows better.\n\nRP-wise, I think this makes sense too. The person who is perceptive may take less in-between steps to reach a conclusion based on their surroundings- someone who isn\'t may need to go through more observations to ultimately reach a conclusion.', ""With anything other than Loot checks, I have my players roll perception 10-15 times before a session, and write them down on a piece of paper. It keeps the game flowing well, especially in dungeons, while still having a bit of randomness to their perception checks. \n\nA while back I actually [wrote an article](https://www.roll4.net/fixing-narrative-perception-rolls/) about how to incorporate it.

Which is saying something as the most current novels have great old ones infiltrating major world governments.\n\nThe premise of The Laundry is that there\'s a secret UK intelligence agency that specializes in occult weirdness. Magic in the setting is basically applied math: If you can perform calculations such that 2+2= 4.1, there may be a way to to use that extra .1 to contact another dimension or otherwise power magic. And what\'s good at doing lots of calculations? Computers! So The Laundry spends a lot of time supervising computer tech and such. Then it gets weird.

I.e., the person who is being chased lays on the speed to up the difficulty. The pursuer tries to cut through the woods to catch up, raising the difficulty again. And then both parties roll their maneuvers at that difficulty.\n\nI’d say you should figure out Acrobatics or Athletics bonuses/penalties for different types of terrain, and a certain range of bonus speed you can add at the risk of raising the DC of my checks.', 'Check out the Auction Mechanic from Whitehack.

Each comes with a difficulty modifier. Pick a set of maneuvers. Roll. Pass the DC, you succeed. Fail the DC, something bad happens. The biggest difference is that SWD6 had a steep multi-action penalty, so like, turning and accelerating and doing a power-slide in the same round would absolutely cripple you.

It does have a couple of interesting ideas, but overall it\'s very bland and washed out. Not to mention I\'m fairly sure Masquerade is easier to find a group for anyway.\n\nStay away from V5. Like, far away. It\'s *horrible*. They took the part of the game that a lot of people hated and just skimmed over (feeding) and made it a much bigger part of the game.

What I mean by that is something literally saying ""If you have certain politics you aren\'t allowed to play this game.""

VtR has fewer clans and a greater focus on setting up a locally-focused game of vampire, and it shows a lot of the lessons the game designers learned from the ups and downs of Masquerade. But \\*Masquerade\\* is the one with the clans people were die-hards about, the miles-deep globe-trotting lore with tons of characters, and all the obscure, weird little bloodlines and bonkers alt-history.

I would avoid V5 because 1) there has been a major dustup about its creators and it\'s a mess I don\'t want to financially support and 2) V5 advances the timeline of the world too far and loses a lot of what made it *itself*.

It falls into a nice fairly traditional mid-crunch game but with tools to abstract a number of things for speed if needed.\n\nYou could also do this with Fate, FAE, or Genesys pretty easily I suspect but I don’t have much experience with them besides reading the books.\n\nI recently discovered an rpg called End of the World: _X_ where the X is Robots, Alien Invasion, Wrath of the Gods, or Zombies.

A weaker character might occasionally be able to escape death with a funny stunt. \n\nWhitewolf World of Darkness: Using a character sheet for an Arcanum member or a supernatural without the extra dots &amp; traits (perhaps Hunter). This would give the game endless potential for growth, but it\'s more likely to take the characters beyond being ordinary useless people at some point. The temptation would be there to start giving them supernatural talents &amp; friends. The tone of the game is going to be gritty, gothy &amp; dark.

rpg,t3_9zx5iq,"GMs/DMs: Rule of thumb regarding placement of combatants on a map at the beginning of a fight?Sort of a general question for any game that uses a ""combat starts with initiative rolls"" type system. 

Let's say you have a fairly open area your PCs are exploring, so there's no entrances or doors that clearly divide one physical space from another. A field, say, or a parking lot.

They encounter hostiles. Maybe they have told you their party has a marching order, maybe not. Maybe they have SOP regarding how they react to new people or creatures. Otherwise, what do you use to determine at what distance the combatants are from each other when combat starts? Does it have to do with how close/far they can see each other and how quickly they can determine they're hostile? Do you usually have some idea of the relative position of the enemy when the party happens upon them? Do you leave it up to the players to tell you how close they want to be, and where they are when combat starts?

Just something that I was thinking about while skimming some pre-written modules, with the maps of forests and such.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/9zx5iq/gmsdms_rule_of_thumb_regarding_placement_of/,"[""There's no exact science for this. My advice would be to take every situation into context.  If the PC's encounter a group at the limit of their vision, there's no need to roll initiative until the two groups are close enough to 'effect change' upon each other, and even then, only when multiple interests are at odds with each other.  Hopefully that make sense."", 'If it’s an encounter that wasn’t led to, such as negotiations breaking down or a huge battle, I sometimes ask the players “how far away were you when this happened?”. Otherwise, I have a rule of thumb of 25 squares/inches (125 feet) away. If it’s daytime or otherwise well lit, that seems like a reasonable distance. It gives archers and wizards a chance to show off and allows for a turn or two of tension as the two groups of combatants move towards each other. That, and it’s the default map size on Roll20. ', ""No hard and fast rules to this, *especially* in the games that have hard and fast rules for it. What makes sense in the narrative, in the scene as it's been established? Do that."", 'Usual answer for me would be ""front lines are one move action away"",  exceptions born out of circumstances. The party at ambushing advantage may choose to either close the gap or further extend it by one increment, larger scale warfare being defaulted to two moves thanks to artilery being common.', ""If the players have told you a marching order, use that. If they haven't, then I place mostly at random. If they're in the wilderness and there's a ranger in the party, she's in front. If they're in the city and there's a talky rogue or bard in the party, he's in front.\n\nBad guys are placed based on a few factors. If they're in place, it's an ambush and they're placed tactically to take advantage of terrain features. If they're not in place yet, they approach based on they're training - hobgoblins approach with an eye to taking advantage of terrain, orcs approach in a mob. Smart leaders hang back or hide while letting minions swarm and take the brunt of counterattacks."", ""How and where they are placed is almost always encounter based.\n\nOn some successful 'suprise' or 'ambush' scenarios, I like to let the players place some (or all) of the enemy.\n\nExample; the players come to a door and the rogue figures out how to peek through a crack without being detected. Of the five orcs, I may place two and tell the rogue to place three and that's what the room looks like when the rogue nods at the fighter to kick in the door."", ""In classic D&amp;D, at least, there's a rule for this: if you're wandering outdoors and have a random encounter, the distance between the player characters and the encounter is 2d6 × 10 yards if nobody is surprised, or 1d4 × 10 yards if one side or both is surprised. The same figures (but in feet instead of yards) are used for random encounters in the dungeon."", ""I like to start everyone roughly 1.5-3 move actions apart from one another, to have a bit of positioning and tactics in the beginning. Running straight into the enemy is discouraged (they'll get to attack you while you only ran into them) and it is a cool moment for every character with greater speed/extra moves to make use of those talents.\n\nThis is just my go-to-encounter-start though. There will be complications for a fight which might include enemies closer to or farther away from the group.\n\nEdit: This does not work on a plain field with no tactical descisions, of course, but those should be avoided anyway.\n"", ""The homebrew I run has informal combat that can start up or end at any moment. I tend to have players define their location frequently, often asking where they are physically putting themselves in a room or in an area. It's so typical that when a fight *does* emerge, I already know where everything is without even having physical props. From time to time I've included maps or props, but 3-dimensional fights tend to confuse them if I use any kind of visual reference."", 'Standard marching order is always a good start.', ""Many systems have encounter distance tables that you can roll on for figuring that stuff out, and I'll generally use that for unexpected contact or first sighting.  But something I've borrowed from tabletop wargames is the ability for the players to place terrain features or simply gain terrain advantages (if playing theater of the mind).\n\nNormally my group plays with zone combat (abstract tiles representing areas of the potential battlefield) no matter what game system.  So the basic open battlefield is a 4x4 hex grid.  And let's say the party does really well in ambushing the enemy.  They not only setup the ambush, but they also execute it flawlessly.  I'll give each player a terrain action in which they can reshape the grid or modify the tiles or even reposition the enemy.   If no one has a distinct advantage then I usually give each side a terrain action to modify something on their side of the battlefield since we can assume both sides would be trying to get a terrain advantage."", 'I just sort of plop them down, unless the scene was very clearly described.\n\n4D6 meters if in doubt. 4D6 times 5 if using black powder weapons. Times 10 if using modern firearms.', 'I shorthand this.  If the group is attacked unexpectedly, I have them set up their positions, then I set up the enemies where they would be.\n\nIf the group is ambushing, I set up the bad guys, then the players set up. \n\nIf it is natural then the players set up, I set up the bad guys at a greater distance.  The idea being the players will have more time to react.\n\nAs long as natural advantages that each side would have been respected, then this works really well.  If players feel they ended up in an unfair position or something, they are free to ask if they can adjust or if they use some skill that allows them to adjust, then that happens.\n\nThe game I play initial positions in combat often has a huge impact on the battle.  So I take care not to give too much of a disadvantage to either side.', ""I usually like wargame style positioning for deployment. In a game where everyone rolls initiative, I'd pull out the map and mark the areas where enemies may deploy and pcs may deploy. Everyone deploys in opposite initiative order, so lowest initiative must deploy first and characters with higher initiative may deploy in reaction.\n\nAs for determining the distances and deployment areas, I always try to have a good idea of the situation in my head and determine the map size and deployment area accordingly. If they see each other from a great distance, I would probably deploy them at the farthest range where combat can occur. If they get ambushed, the enemy deployment area might surround them and the enemies likely won't be very far if they don't want to be."", 'I think a good way to introduce a group of NPC from the distance is declaring it in temporal terms related to the visibility.\nThe main goals of an encounter are, I think, to provide a challenge and therefore build tension and meaning to the characters\' choices.\n\nDistance can alter dramatic and tactical value.\n\nTime is crucial when adding tension, being both a objective (seconds/minutes/hours/turns) and subjective (every player\'s perception) measurement.\nDistance in seconds/minutes if the area is particularly wide can help the players decide their approach, while the danger is steadily pursuing them. \n\nA completely plain and void scenario is kind of boring (it excludes tactical advantages) but can make sense: the heroes are exploring a desert, the tundra, the moon...\n\n""The mist starts raising from the frozen soil, opening a clear visual of your surroundings (-&gt; before they couldn\'t foresee the encounter). A group of dire wolves is festing on a dead bear (which should translate to your players\' minds as ""Did they kill a friggin bear? These wolves are dangerous!""). You can estimate that, if they spot you / having they spotted you, they will arrive in less than a minute. What do you do?""\n\nTherefore, the player can change their behaviour and actions.\n\nAs a rule of thumb you can give 2 to 5 actions to both sides to reach each other. The wolves and the party will clash in melee if they both run against each other for 2-3 turns: therefore, take one human pace + one wolf pace, multiply it for 6 (3 turns for both) and you have your initial distance. Maybe the PCs will stand still or try to flee, but these are their tactial options for this fight.\n\nI will use Savage Worlds\' distant rules, being more familiar with this system, in order to provide a low-medium crunch level of mechanics to translate real time to grid measurement. \n\nA turn is about 6 seconds, therefore if the wolves, going at full Pace but not running (Run is a rabdom value), will arrive in 60 seconds, 10 turns will be taken. They have a Pace of 8 (vs Human Pace of 6), therefore the distance in inches (2,5 cm, a square on the grid) is 8 x 10 = 80 (200 cm, 160 meters).\n\nThis is a huge number: there aren\'t many weapons with that range. Therefore the PC will have to wait for the wolves to close the distance (out of range -&gt; long range (-4 to Shooting) -&gt; medium (-2) -&gt; short (no penalty)), maybe having the time to draw their weapons and take aim (skipping one turn to give +2 to their next Shooting attack). But meanwhile, the wolves are closing the gap... The wolves may use rocks, stumps, fallen trees, crouching or going prone to impose other penalties to the Shooting rolls, in order to make the PCs waste bullets or power points (maybe one of them is a wizard/sorcerer/etc...).\nKeep the turn short and describe the fangs of the wolves, the claws rasping the ground, the bloody eyes of the beasts, each time closer and closer... \n\nOr the characters may decide to flee, starting a Chase sequence. With the new rules, you can give the PCs a bunch of Distance Tokens more, helping them to escape.\n\nOr they can try a Dramatic Task with Stealth to circumnavigate the beasts without being discovered.\n\nKeep always some options for your players outside of combat, and let them add details if that makes sense. When in a desert, the players may want to hide behind a giant dune, to avoid the bandits on the other dune, or trying to allure a giant scorpion to attack them. A crater on the moon can provide a solid hideout to the eldritch alien roaming the lunar landscape (provided it doesn\'t found them with other sense beside eyeseight) ', 'They go where they want, every time. Anything else will force them to constantly manage their location, which is boring. Within reason. ', 'What game are you playing? I’m pretty sure that most iterations of D&amp;D have a rule for this.

rpg,t3_9zwx4r,"Unique quest typesWe all know about fetch quests, assassinations, or investigations. What are some genres of quests that you've run for your groups and the stories behind them? 

I have an interesting one from a while ago to start off, a bit TL;DR but I'll post the story in the comments so the OP doesn't get too long. Short version: I ran a 'reign of terror' quest for my main group at one point. It was a sandbox quest in my setting, a town had just come under occupation by the player character's 'protagonist' faction. To give them a breather after their pretty insane last few sessions, I thought they might like a session of hanging around town and solving some problems to bring the new citizens into the fold. It got pretty dark and they ended up starting a revolution to ingratiate themselves with the townsfolk to then smoke them out and destabilize the region. 

I'm really curious to hear some other stories of similarly unique or weird quests. We've all had some!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/9zwx4r/unique_quest_types/,"[""It''s difficult to think of anything unique when it comes to overt ''You're It' type quests. e.g. Quest where the players are clearly tagged to do something defined by the GM through an NPC.\n\nWhere I found a rich hunting ground for weird quests was in having the PC's brush against the lives of others pursuing their own agendas which did not even need the PC's involvement.  These encounters tended to grow a life of their own very quickly, with the players trying to work out what the hell was going on, what if anything they could do to help, and whether they were on the right side.\n\nExample: The party are walking along the dockside in Nuln, minding their own business and arguing about whether the elf in the party ought to try and make some money by becoming a dancer.\n\nThey pass an old man clearly in a panic, who runs up to them and grabbing Falco's arm asks 'Did you see who stole my bag?' . Falco hadn't, however, the elf with her bird like perception had seen a small boy snatch it when the old man was distracted.  But true to form she said nothing to the others, still annoyed with them for not embracing her desire to dance.\n\nThe party stopped and began asking the old man questions e.g. What did it look like?/where had he left it etc?\n\nFalco suggested they report the theft to the town watch, but the old man wasn't keen on that idea.  He wanted the party to help him find it.  \\[Oddly enough the party never questioned this reluctance, I thought it might ring alarm bells, but I suspect they simply assummed that the GM (me) was trying to force them to deal with it themselves, and that this must therefore be a primary plot trigger that they were meant to follow up. Players tend to over think things sometimes. The real reason the old man was reluctant to involve the watch was that his bag contained a number of heretical books which would get him in a lot of trouble if they were discovered.  One being borrowed from the Unseen Library and due for return, hence his panic to retrieve it, as the penalty for non-return was an unpleasant death.\\]\n\nThe Old Man introduced himself as Professor Theodosius Forsch, a lecturer at the local Imperial College and a supplier of books and other study materials to the three Colleges in the city.  He owned a shop on the other side of town, but had intended to travel to Altdorf by river this morning until his bag was stolen.\n\nThe party began to discuss ways to track down the Professors bag, including the printing of flyers offering a reward for its return and trying to contract the local Thieves Guild.  During this debate on the dockside, as the Professor became more and more desperate, a small boy approached Falco and tugging on his sleeve finally got his attention and asked if he needed help find the bag.  Falco eventually took notice of the dirty little street urchin who at first he assumed was begging for money.  'I saw the one that took it?' seemed to be the general message.\n\nHaving finally got the stupid grown ups attention Cuffy the street gang leader gave them an eleborate story of a mysterious rogue dressed in black who had crept up and snatched the bag when the old man was distracted talking to some dockers.\n\nThe party bought the story (the elf still said nothing) and Cuffy held out his hand and got a couple of copper for his information.  'I knows where he took it too?' he adds helpfully still with his hand out.  'Me and me mates will steal it back fer yer, if yer gimme sixpence.'  This kind of threw the party who were by now well into 'search and retrieve' mode, and expecting to have to deal with a desperate rogue in black from the local thieves guild.  A sixpenny solution seemed like a scam and they dismissed it as such.\n\nMeanwhile, Cuffy's gang of street brats were hunkered down in the alleyway between two warehouses guarding the Professors bag and waiting for Cuffy to signal that he had been given the sixpenny finders fee before running up with the good news that they had found the missing bag.  They had already riffled through the bag and removed anything of value (to them), which basically meant the Professor had lost his lunch and some of his more expensive looking clothing, but the books were still in the bag being of little interest to the children, none of whom could read and who had no contacts who they thought would buy them.\n\nThis triggered a protracted and pretty pointless quest to find the Professors bag, with Cuffy and his gang trailing them around the city making repeated offers to help and occassionally being paid pennies for information, some of which was accurate.  Until Cuffy finally announced that they he had found the bag, and sold it back to them with its remaining contents for a shilling.\n\nInteresting point being that throughout all of this the elf never let on that she had seen Cuffy take the bag in the first place."", ""I like role play quests. There are three that I have fond memories of from my game.\n\nThe first was a performance. The party was hired to help put on a performance during an important festival. It involved at least 3 players. The idea was I gave them roles to play, in this case a farmer, the ranch hand, and a cow. Then I read a story and when it got to the point that one of the characters needed to talk, that player would say whatever they wanted. Made for some weird and hilarious conversation but this doesn't work for every group because of the heavy improv.\n\nAnother one was a bard wanted to put on a show in a high end bar/inn. The only problem was the Bard was a goblin. The party had to convince the owner to allow a goblin to perform in his high end bar which ended with the party needing to spread word around town about the performance. They basically became carnival bakers for thus one to drum up interest. They became really enamored with this bard and his 15 minutes of fame at the table is still talked about after almost 2 years.\n\nLast one was a subterfuge quest. A new bakery was opening and it was taking the original baker's clients. Gave the party 100gp to spread rumors about the new bakery and drive business away from it. This one went a lot off the rails by burning down the new bakery, threatening the new baker into working for the old baker and then holding the fact that the old baker hired them to do this as a means to get him to sell the rights of his bakery over to the party. They ended up franchising. It was insane and left the group with a lot of inside jokes."", ""Fighting Tournament like Mortal Kombat.  My group just started a new campaign set in the DtD40k (parody mash up of rpgs) setting using the Stars Without Number system.  They've chosen to pursue a plot hook of entering an interstellar combat tournament to save a cluster of planets from being dragged annexed by the Forces of Chaos.  We're only 1 session in so I have no clue how this is going to turn out.  We've been wanting to do a tournament style arc for a while, but the systems we usually play are too detailed meaning that if there's a 1v1 fight, the rest of the players don't get to play for a while which I'm very much against.  But the SWN system has nothing to it, so it'll resolve a conflict in no time."", '**The Reign of Terror**\n\n*Start of Darkness*\n\nStarted pretty innocuously. Rather than mediating the dispute between two families, they threw both in the stockades in town square. These were established families. There was a protest. Sidenote on this part of the story: They did this in the middle of the night during curfew. No one in the town even knew it was them. Masks, gloves, etc.\n\nProtests lead to deploying imbued chili powder as tear gas that had been aerosolized. A couple people were blinded which meant even more unrest. The country this town was taken from was a hybrid democracy so they got together to call a vote. The players showed up as \'sympathetic\' observers while the undermanned garrison (they were ahead of the main army) looked on very nervously. Players told them to stay back. I had planned on a riot scene. They did order the most charismatic speaker to be temporarily arrested after the meeting\n\nThe next day, the town woke up to the former mayor and two of the more accessible ringleaders of the plebiscite from the day before hanged in the middle of the market square. No one cared about curfew at this point but superstitions from the townsfolk prevented them from going near financial centers at night, they learned. ""Money changing hands in the dark"" shortened to ""dark wealth"" was a common curse in this town.\n\n*Revolution*\n\nOutrage followed and the riot happened with the PCs joining in as all the occupying troops retreated to their blockhouse where the prisoner was being held. The most charming party member got up and made an impassioned speech about storming the blockhouse. Ladders and all kinds of improvised weapons were brought in while the terrified garrison began to shoot a few arrows into the crowd.\n\nI figured they decided to join the other side or go rogue and played ""La Marseille"" for the soundtrack. The garrison was spared by the urgings of the players and locked in the town hall under guard. This town had problems with their old overlords so a \'constitutional convention\' was called in the blockhouse. They even made some symbols to show their new allegiance. \n\nEmissaries were sent to other discontented towns to create a new nation. They had no idea the main army was on its way (a fact I actually forgot about). The blockhouse was stocked with quite a bit of blackpowder. The players left to \'join the party\'. Got outside and joined the fun. \n\n*Too trusting*\n\nInteresting note, a plague devastated the area years prior. The blockhouse was formerly an asylum so the doors could be locked from the outside. \n\nAfter coming back to check on the convention again, they locked all the doors behind them and lit the inside on fire. \n\nAn explosion echoed through the night. They rushed to the town hall to get more \'help\'. The few guards that stayed were quickly killed. Planks were pried from the doors and a couple wannabe collaborators were also executed. \n\n*Woe to the vanquished*\n\nConfusion spread and the players went to \'check on\' the rebel\'s weapons stockpile in the church to \'make sure everything was okay\', most of the guards were hustled off to deal with the now spreading blaze. Those that stayed were backstabbed by the players.\n\nThings were reaching a fever pitch. All the leadership of this poor town had already died. The players ran out to help in combatting the blaze. Confirming that weapons were not in the hands of the population, one of them whistled and the now rearmed garrison formed up behind the crowd. It was a massacre. \n\n*A new citizenry*\n\nWith almost everyone that mattered dead and the fighting spirit of the town totally crushed, the populace was quarantined in the town hall and surrounding buildings. Many were later chained to production lines in the town\'s factory to produce weapons for the incoming army or used as slave farmers.\n\n*Communication delay*\n\nThey later traveled to the contacted settlements to spread their \'revolution\' that overthrew the government only for it to be quickly destroyed by the incoming army.\n\nNote:\n\nMy players, who were earlier known war criminals but excused by friends in high places, brutalized these town into submission. We ended up bouncing off one another. In hindsight I should\'ve seen this coming. Very serious RPers. There was a rebel cell in the town and the idea was they\'d work through a few mini quests to get there. \n\nIt was edgy but not bullshit, the party made some questionable choices IC and just rolled with it as character growth moments.

You could, of course, use the old Classic rule with 2e, if you want. \n\nThat said, there are still things I found unclear in the 2e books. The number of skill rolls you get per term is not clear, for example. The flow chart doesn't mention getting skill rolls on advancement, but apparently you do.

rpg,t3_9zv7xt,"Question: Xeno's CareersI'm trying to learn Rogue Trader, and one thing that stuck out to me was that some of the Xeno's Careers are rather interesting if I sought to build certain character archetypes which talents that don't seem to be available to the core human / sub-human careers.

Where (page) in the rule books does it talk about this? Into the storm mentions that xeno's careers do not have an origin path unless the GM says so. Though it does not suggest you cannot take that career as a human.

Common sense dictates a human cannot take the Kroot / Ork career. Makes sense, but what of others? Say a Gue'vesa, a human of the tau, could they learn to operate drones, or various tau tactics and equipment? Would they have access to the unique talents which are faction / career specific? Taking the non-imperial trait seems to make sense. Or say, a Tormented human in the arena who's master or disgraced dark eldar companion found it amusing to train them in the craft of a Kabalite Warrior, or maybe they began mimicking it after countless battles in the arena. Say the Alt Career path of a Fleshcrafter Disciple. As with the tech priest Magos Domos Agnelian who to a more or less degree acts as a insane slave haemonculi.

Which is why i'm interested in finding the rules, because the requirement for the Alt Careers are Any Dark Eldar Career, but it does not specify race as far as I can tell.

Required Careers: Any Dark Eldar

Alternate Rank: Rank 4 or higher (13,000 xp)

Requirements: Int 40, Medicae, Trade (Chymist)

Other Requirements: The Explorer must have had the opportunity to train in the Dark Eldar ways of the fleshcrafter, the poisoner, and the alchemist, and learned to wield the double-edged scalpel of depraved healing and exquisite harm that comes with starting down this dark and twisted path.

rpg,t3_9zv4eh,"I'm creating a pre-made character for a campaign book; seeking a writer from the LGBTQ-gamer community to give feedback.My goal is to include at least one explicitly gay character so as to increase the quality of inclusion of the book.  *Please do not reply about this goal - I'm not interested in discussing the merits of this approach.*

The current background is as follows:

&gt;Gregory is a young American from Florida; he has always felt like he was born at the wrong time and the wrong place. In high school gym class, Gregory discovered that he was more interested in men than woman. Gregory quickly discovered that Floridian society had little tolerance for homosexuals, and much less for Jewish homosexuals.

&gt;Gregory fled to Asia at a young age, in search of a career and a place to call home. Shortly after arriving in Shanghai, Gregory met XXXX at the Shanghai synagogue. XXXX befriend Gregory and got him a job bar tending at the Long Bar on the 2nd floor of the Shanghai Club Building on the Bund. Greg is good at mixing up cocktails, and while at work, Gregory hears all the juicy gossip and scandals. Thus far, relocating to Shanghai is looking like a good decision.

I'm willing to change this and I can add *at most* two or three more sentences. I cannot change the profession much.  This takes place in a Cthulhu / Mythos setting, in the 1920s.  

I'm asking for feedback from people from the LGBTQ community who are members here.  I'm wondering that just mentioning the characters sexuality may not be enough.  Is there something missing or improvements that can be made... or is this good enough for the purposes of adding representation?  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/9zv4eh/im_creating_a_premade_character_for_a_campaign/,"[""A Jewish man named Gregory kind of feels off. Gregory is traditionally a Catholic name. The Gregory's I know are named after Saint Gregory.

Like, can he have a life outside of that? What personality traits does he have? Especially in 1920’s setting, where you can’t be as open about that, and it rarely comes up in CoC, I’d have very little to go off.\n\nSo like, maybe mention it in a one off like “When he got to Shanghai, he saw in his current boyfriend XX something kindred, as both shared an easy spirit and a love for social gatherings and gossip. Then devote the rest to his personality.\n\n', 'I think the main thing when dealing with queer rep in historical settings is that before you can actually write something like this, you need to establish the degree of authenticity and how much oppression is on screen, ideally as something different groups can adjust.\n\nIf you want something similar, look to how Harlem Unbound tackles racism.', 'To modern ears using ""homosexual"" sounds clinical and often will raise hackles. On the other hand, ""gay"" didn\'t come into vogue until, I think, after World War II. I\'m not sure but I think that the term ""invert"" was in clinical use in the CoC era. You could avoid the terminology by just subbing ""men like him"" for ""homosexual[s]"".\n\nI think the depiction is reasonably respectful; there\'s not a lot you can do with so few words. You\'re getting across that the character is attracted to men, that this isn\'t something society is going to give him an easy time with, and he\'s found his own way to try to find some more freedom to be himself.\n\nIsn\'t Shanghai still a British holding at this phase of history? Their laws and society probably aren\'t going to be much kinder than Florida, but I don\'t know much at all about it.', 'Speaking as a bisexual gamer here. I can only speak for myself and the gaymers I have discussed this with, not the LGBTQ crowd in general and *certainly* not the others in this sub.\n\nI think that explicitly labeling him as gay in a modern setting is a cop out, and anything other than hunting at it through good writing (Greg’s boyfriend Sam, etc) feels a bit... I dunno, pandering? To me. \n\nNow the twenties in itself raises an entirely different point. Depends on how accurate you want the game to be, but it might be an open secret among friends? Repressed? Taking painstaking measures to hide it?\n\nI think you’ve got a big start here, but my main (and huge) problem with the line of thinking about putting gay characters in is that the very act of being LGBT is either enough of a personality for them OR that them being LGBT is the biggest part of their life. While that might be true of some of us, I find it immensely frustrating when that comes up in media I, a bisexual man, consume. Which is a damn shame really, because I would love there to be more representation for the community in RPGs. \n\nI hope you accomplish what you are trying to do well, and I hope that this was somewhat helpful. Good luck! ', 'I am a gay Jewish gamer myself. Usually when I create characters and stories like to poke as many holes as I can in them and patch them up better to make amazing characters. For example, Gregory is not traditionally a Jewish name, Shanghai was just as anti-gay as the US at the time, and how was he able to move to Asia, alone? Wouldn’t he go somewhere closer? And how did he afford it? And why Asia? If you just explain all the details then it will work much better, like how old he was, how he escaped(did you choose Shanghai because the rest of the campaign takes place there? Maybe give some sort of explanation if that is the case), ect. It’s a pc’s favorite thing in the world to fuck with the dm and poke holes in their plans, so if you do it first, you have this extra layer of safety. But otherwise your gay character seems to be fine, as long as he has an actual 3 dimensional personality and isn’t just defined by his sexuality(like he has actual hobbies, ect.). Also, good job having representation in your Campaigns, a lot of my strait friends don’t, or forget to, so thanks!\nThanks for reading this block of text!', '1. Being a Jew in America in the 1920s was sometimes a scary thing to be. Anti Semitism was at an all-time high. The KKK was rising in prominence, and Jews were increasingly becoming the scapegoat, blamed for the ills of big business and capitalism. If you were in a place like Florida, this probably weighed heavily on your mind.\n\n2. Florida was a different place back then. Why did you choose Florida as the site of this character’s fleeing? There certainly were Jewish populations in Florida at the time; but Florida is definitely a different experience than New York, or other northern cities.\n\n3. Why does this character decide that Shanghai is a place to which he might flee? To an American consciousness at the time, if you were queer and Jewish, I think you’d think to move to Harlem, Greenwich Village, San Francisco; why look abroad? \n\n4. Most people seeking to move to Shanghai at this time are likely doing or seeking some illicit thing right? I feel like a queer person fleeing America for a foreign country would be forced to suffer a lot more than simply arriving and being offered a job. Part of oppression for queer people and Jews is being disallowed participation in normative society. It’s not just a label, it has serious material consequences in the world. \n\n5. His queerness ought to be central to his story. His Jewishness ought to be central to his story. His place of origin and his decision to leave ought to be central to his story. Do research on all of these things and figure out what queerness was like in the 1920s. Figure out what being Jewish was like. It seems you just need to understand that things were very different back then — not necessarily “worse.” But very different.', ""I am bi.\nHere is my take:\n* I think, unless the game is specifically about addressing homophobia, having it as a setting element isn't super interesting or fun. This is a game about the Cthulhu Mythos, who cares about historical accuracy?\n\n* I think explicitly labelling this PC as gay is fine, I wouldn't do it in the opening description. That makes it seem like it's a major defining trait.\n\n* I think the term homosexual is a bit clinical. I suggest using gay, or not labelling and just inferring through romantic entanglements. \n\n* I think it is a little stereotypical that a gay guy is a bartender who gets into juicy gossip and scandals. I would probably rephrase that.\n\n* Are synagogues a big thing in Shanghai?\n\n* I think fleeing from homophobia, while historically accurate is a bit overdone honestly. I would go with either a romantic interest in Shanghai, maybe fleeing for a different reason, or something Mythos related. Personally, I would go with the idea that PC has a gambling problem and is reneging on a loan from organized crime. Also a bit overdone, but it is solidly in genre for noir. \n\nIn my opinion, most of the time, less is more when it comes to representation. It is easier to avoid tokenization or stereotyping if you understate it a bit.\n\nNow, having listened to the Mafia podcast, personally I would have him be from New York, Chicago, or Las Vegas, or maybe he lived in Cuba. There used to be (and might still be?) a big Jewish presence in organized crime. That could be interesting, or potentially problematic as well.\n\nHere's my altered write up, with a more typical Jewish name (my own name, but I'm not Jewish):\n\nJeremiah was usually the quiet kid in school, he focused more on his studies than socializing. He especially excelled at mathematics and Hebrew language studies. Although he is naturally fit, he usually found himself too distracted by his teammates to be of any use in sports.\n\nHis interest in math lead to a fascination with probability, and from there to an unfortunate fascination with cards and dice, a fascination which cost him friends, family, his college savings, and nearly his life. He fled Chicago and now works as a bartender at the Long Bar. He tries to focus on avoiding attention and spending time with his boyfriend XXXX, and their collection of exotic and unusual plants, but interesting rumors at the bar are a potential threat to his stability and hard earned gambling avoidance.\n\nNow, that might be a bit problematic too, but from this write up the PC is clearly some flavor of queer, clearly went to a religious school, and is fleeing for reasons that are personal, not institutional. Also, with his interest in weird plants and at least one ancient language, we have some potential tie ins to the Mythos."", 'I\'m not sure how much you are going for historical accuracy here, but America in the 1920s largely respected and welcomed homosexuality and Florida had stronghold cities like Miami, Orlando, and Tampa where openly gay politicians, businessmen, and professors were normal and accepted. There were sodomy laws on the books, but they were subject to weak enforcement to the point that straight men and women would show up *en masse* to courthouses to ""turn themselves in"" for committing the ""crime"" of sodomy (which was then defined as oral or anal contact in many cases) to protest the laws. A homosexual growing up in America would have had as good a chance as anyone of living a fulfilling life.

I assume he needs to be Jewish for the players to have access to have someone speak Hebrew. \n\nthe first paragraph for a bio works fine, Gregory would have been regarded as mentally Ill and probably ran from a threat of conversion therapy(either electroshock therapy or if he was effeminate they probably would have gone right to an ice pick lobotomy). the top targets of the day would have been new york, Greenwich village or Manhattan(both slums at the time, with people to poor to care what you were doing) or California, west hollywood or the castro/folsom districts of San Fransisco(more slums at the time).  He needs to wear a red tie.\n\ni don't know much about how gays were treated in Britian but if [Alan Turning's treatment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) is any indication i don't think it was much better.\n\nYAY LGBTQ+ history! who would have thought that a college elective would have come in handy some day."", 'If you really want to be “not offensive”, I just wouldn’t mention his sexuality at all. I’ve never browsed through a campaign booklet or any other resource and seen *anything* that calls out a particular character’s sexuality: gay or straight. That’s because no one really cares, and the person who ends up playing the character will decide their sexuality...if it ends up mattering at all. \n\nIt would be one thing if it were commonplace for resources to wax philosophical about how the characters therein are all straight. Then I could see the case for specifically calling out one character as being gay. Since that’s not the case, I caution you that there’s a good chance it will be seen as tokenistic pandering/virtue signaling. ']"

We created an impromptu tRPG system about surviving the rigors of a fancy tea party. We came up with ability scores, feats, classes, the whole nine yards. The four ability scores were Taste, Manners, Refinement and Appeal, the four classes were Noble, Socialite, Snob and Advocate, each with their own abilities and modifiers.

rpg,t3_9zochx,"Would like some feedback, is this too complicated?I like the D20 system for combat heavy games, but I've never really been satisfied by any skill system I've seen for it.  Pretty much none of them tie skill advancement to things your character is actually doing, and even with systems like BRP you're limited in the skills you can list on the character sheet.  On top of that, BRP assumes that you can only advance in a skill if you succeed, rather than learning from your failures.  So, I had a bizarre idea for a system, which I think would be more realistic and would encourage roleplaying, but I also think might be way too complicated.

Now, in this system no specific skills would be listed on the character sheet.  Instead players would have a list of ""Experiences"" their characters had had.  Whenever a character wanted to make a skill roll they'd add the relevant ability modifier, and then count up the number of experiences they had that would be relevant.

At first level the player would get three experiences.  Their occupation (if it's relevant, they get +3), their hobby (+2), and their childhood (+1).  So, for example, a fisherman turned adventurer would get a +3 to sail a ship, an adventurer who grew up in a fishing village but left many years ago would only get +1 based on what he could remember, and a yacht racer would get +2 since he had less experience but it was fairly recent.  However, the yacht racer would get no bonus for fishing since his experiences involve only sailing but not fishing.  Hence, no need to worry about crowding the character sheet with lots of closely related but slightly different skills, nor giving characters the ability to do things they clearly have no experience with simply because they have a skill in something vaguely related.

Now, with every level the players are asked ""what is the most significant thing that has happened to your character since you last leveled up?""  Whatever it is, they add it to their list of Experiences and going forward they get another +1 whenever it's relevant.  This would encourage characters to seek out non-combat activities, and roleplay to make sure they can justify whatever relevant experience they want being a memorable experience for their character in-universe.

rpg,t3_9znjcy,"Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everythingHere’s a little world building game that may get the old creative juices flowing. The BACKGROUND to this is below but skip to “WORLDBUILDING GAME” below if you want to get straight to it. 

BACKGROUND
Myself and a couple of friends are working on a “multiverse” RPG/collaborative world building project. Key influences are some of our favourites rpgs - Continuum/Narcissist, Kult, Mage, Nobilis, The Strange and Everway as well as movies/tv (Doctor Strange, Inception, The Matrix, Doctor Who) and comics (The Invisibles, Planetary, Luther Arkwright, Black Science). 

The overall feel is “Weird Science Fantasy”, a blend of magic and science that we refer to as “Mystical Mechanical.” Imagine if China Miéville and Grant Morrison had been given the keys to Doctor Who and asked the love child of Dan Hillier and Jack Kirby to do concept art! 

WORLD BUILDING GAME
We have been working up some setting worlds/scenarios. We want to make these quite unusual and memorable - not the “Romans in space” or “if Nazi’s won the WWII” or Tolkeinesque/Gibsonesque clones. 

I came up with a little game which we play  to create original settings. (Can be played solo or even better with friends). 

1. Think of a music album with an evocative title or feel to it - it helps if it’s one you know well
2. Use that to riff off/create ideas for a setting using the album titles, musical flavour, song titles, lyrics or general feel of the album 
3. Encapsulate that setting in no more than five sentences 
4. Present you ideas to your co-players (competitors) 
5. Award points or vote on a winner - special points for those who can weave song titles, lyrics and potentially any characters into setting. 
6. Combine/evolve ideas from competitors (or their settings) to add further flavour to the winner. 

These create some truly interesting and memorable settings for a small campaign or one off adventure but could be used for wider and more focused world building with further work. 

A recent example:

Let England Shake (PJ Harvey) 
The English Civil War has been ongoing for more than two hundred years in a perpetually snow covered and ice rimed countryside. 
Through the waft of gunpowder smoke, Puritanical Iron Giant automotitans stride, battling Royalist folk horror Kaiju like Black Phillips the giant six-eyed tentacled goat man, crushing ancient stone churches and thatched roof villages underfoot 
The iron masked Lord Protector mentally controls his Iron Giants from his Iron Throne in the gothic spired theo-political palace maze of Westminister. 
Royalists hold out  in their ramshackle ruined country houses and their stronghold in Oxford. The country is in ruins, people are starving and an uprising is coming led by the Resurrectionists, a faction whose origins are in the underworld. 

We have also developed an entire set of interlinked worlds (we refer to them in world as Rivens) called the “Path of The Nine” which are based upon the nine Nine Inch Nails studio albums. 

Just a bit of fun but I hope this helps. What ideas can you come up with using this method? What other techniques have you found useful for building RPG settings or scenarios?

rpg,t3_9zn5r3,"Can't remember the name of a systemI saw a neat system I liked maybe about a year back that I think was relatively new. 

Basically the system worked by picking features and traits. Characters were mostly built on creation with a value system. Essentially the big theme of it was you pick an effect, and how it happens is up to you. Whether you have a robot arm that shoots fire or you're a sorcerer that conjures fire didn't matter.

I think it also had a much more forgiving check system where pass and fail was basically you fail/something else/success. Something else was like an event occurs where you neither pass or fail.

rpg,t3_9zmxz4,"Adhd and being a dungeonmasterHi there everyone. Today i wanna ask and talk a little about roleplaying and how it corelates with adhd

Im kind of new to roleplaying. Ive been doing it for about a year. I started around the time i got my adhd diagnosis (im currently 18)

Also these things will probably sound like excuses and/or normal people problems. So be aware that what i say is just my personal experience with adhd and roleplaying  and it does not mean you should take it as facts about adhd in general and instead just as one persons journey with both of the subjects ^-^

Anyways
I feel as if some things gets easier while others get harder when you have adhd and your dming 
Like for example. Reading books and learning rules are extremly harsh. Takes me about 3 months to read a ruleset. (Mostly becuse i push it up all the time)
I also have a hard time inspiring myself to actually roleplay with others. 
And when im dming it can get really confussing becuse people talk untop of each other
And ofc the focus going away

But some good things are the amazing improving skills you get and the creativity.
And the rush of figuring something out and getting to work is just amazing

All they had to do was follow the quest giving NPC or express suspicion to set off either a trailing into a junkyard at night to witness a macabre display or they\'d have had their car towed there and have to pick it up, running into the same.\n\nNope, took everything at face value and spent 40 minutes trying to figure out 1920s pricing for their provisions. \n\nThe good news at least was that I largely stole the side mission and adapted it for play so it wasn\'t completely from scratch. ', 'We were playing Star Wars Edge of the Empire and the PCs wanted to make some credits. The PCs were a decent way into XP gain so they were getting pretty powerful and they wanted to do something bold. They wanted to go back to a planet where they once got a job from a Hutt underboss where they wanted to steal the Hutt’s art collection. The session was about over so once they dropped out of hyperspace near the planet I described it and said there was a ship familiar to one of the players in orbit. Said player was once did some minor work for Jabba the Hutt and recognized the ship, Jabba’s ship. Now, Jabba’s ship was just something I threw in to rattle them a bit. Jabba wasn’t actually there as he had sent an underling to the planet. I closed the session there and went to prepare their heist for next time, little did I know my PCs were not prepared to be *that* bold.\n\nSo I spent the next week preparing the heist, made up some NPCs and some possible allies they could meet. I drew the layout of the palace so they would have a reference for their planning having been there before. I even developed a guard pattern they could learn if they were patient enough. So all that was left now was to see how they wanted to approach this challenge. Next session rolled around and once everyone was there they all agreed to go somewhere else. Apparently my scare tactic worked too well, the players had had their own discussions over the week and did not want to face Jabba the Hutt and decided to go to “a random planet” (their own words). \n\nInternally screaming and kicking myself, I picked a planet I knew quite a bit about which I could improvise on and sent them on their way. This led to a series of events the player would call “Base Building Simulator 2017” after my improv gave them the opportunity to acquire a small base. The entire campaign turned into managing a smuggling organization which the players enjoyed. Looking back I am okay with what happened but damn did it derail my plans for what the campaign was going to be.', 'I anticipated their compliance to accept the quest from the supposed heel-turned Illithid. They did not. I spent a grand amount of time and effort on the dungeon. It\'s theme and purpose means it can\'t be easily retooled. So there it sits until I concoct another reason to use it.\n\nI\'ve never held to a course of action I felt they reasonably circumvented. Sometimes I\'ve felt verisimilitude demanded a reaction from the world that I think ended up feeling like rail-roading, but I never meant it to. I spend a lot of time trying only to think of what the villains and good NPCs *want* to do, so that I can be flexible with what the players end up doing. Sometimes though it\'s like, ""No, he\'s not going to give you the location, he just... can\'t trust you.""', 'I built a skypirate ship that had crashed into a canyon and had subsequently become the roost of some nasty bird-like things. The ship was essentially a dungeon, full of loot and information about trade routes and landmark in the surrounding area. In order to destroy the nest of bird-things, my players burned the whole ship and walked away.', 'Everything but the violence.', 'Not really unknowingly, but I spent about 4 months preparing a metropolis that the party had been making their way towards for quite some time. People were wanting to try it an urban campaign-directing for a while, so they were traveling towards this enormous city that was also the location of the world’s largest magical academy to investigate several items they had acquired, and investigate some anomalous magical events they had seen along the way.\n\nOn our second session in the city, one party member used an ability I had given her as part of her backstory called the Chant of Creation. Long story short, in the back of her mind is one of the words used in the creation of the world, and she can consciously focus on it to attempt to connect with the world. On her check to use it, she rolls a natural 20, and then another, and then a natural 19.\n\nIf she had gotten 3 20s in a row, she would have ascended to godhood. So the party goes to her room and finds her comatose and surging with energy, having wired herself into the background matrix of energy that holds the world together. So the party fled the city with her body before the equivalent of the magic Men in Black showed up to take her away.\n\nAnd they also learned there is a contract devil running the city’s underworld, so even after they fixed her, they aren’t planning on going back for a long while. ', 'I had planned out a plot where my players would start with them going to pick up a legendary item for a patron, in the largest city in the setting. Only to have it evolve into them saving the city form a divine plague. That would have devastated, not only the city, but the entire continent (as the city produces the majority of the food that is consumed). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt would have involved them using most of their skills and been really, really role-play heavy (which is our group\'s preference). Had they gone along this plot, they would have acquired the legendary item and a ton of other rewards at the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut instead, they decided had to take (well paying) work with a merchant, so they could pay off a large debt, the result of healing one of them after he ruined his arm with an awesome fire spell. Even though the alchemist they were indebted to where rather chill about it, telling them there was no rush. They all where all like ""we need to get this paid off, like yesterday"". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow they are going to end up with a mountain between them and that plot line. Thinking of just letting the plague hit the city, could be an interesting event that creates new plot hooks.', 'Call of Cthulhu:\n\nThe resolution of the scenario.  We\'re three adventures in.  The first one (The Haunting) they did fine with.  After that, they get halfway in and gather a bunch of clues to figure out basically what\'s going on and then they\'re like ""We go to the police and tell them what\'s going on"".\n\nThey sanitize the story enough that they don\'t get locked up or committed, but they pretty much skip the all the resolution...', ""I made a huge dungeon that would give my players some insight on the real BBEG in the entire campaign. They decided to skip it and there was no other way to railroad them into it. So they struggled with fake BBEG for many sessions.

rpg,t3_9zkali,"(OPINION) Why Maze Rats does so much with so littleAt this point you may have heard of Maze Rats, R/RPG's October's RPG of the month. I have bought it, and ran  some sessions. Most importantly, a small campaign with my canadian cousins (they visited for 2 weeks so a session almost every day).
Over this time, i've grown to like it very much. So much, i could say it's 13 pages provide more than some D&amp;D handbooks (looking at you, 5e DM's guide!).
My point is:
1: Randomly generated.
Each and every thing (well,not all of them) are listed in a table. These tables have 6 groups of 6 items. You roll 2d6, and wham, new item, spell or whatever. It allows for amazing results, especially in the magic/enemy trait department, since the GM chooses what spells and enemies do. This keeps it fresh and not repetitive.
2: Easily accessible.
It's simple. 1 page of text, which can be resumed into a quarter or less. Uses d6,which are easy to get,and character sheets take half a paper sheet,which is small yet enough to fit all your magical nooks and crannys. This makes it easier for beginners into rpgs to understand and get what they need.
3: Very good balance between skills/paths.
Since there are no classes, when creating a character and when leveling up to certain levels you can choose to either gain a spell slot, an attack bonus or a path,which gives advantage(roll 3d6 instead of 2d6 and pick the 2 highest roll ones) on certain situations. This gives a sense of fairness other rpgs certainly lack (wink wink nudge nudge D&amp;D 3.5).
4: VERY FAST.
The combat, socializing, exploration and character creation are all smooth fast. Since you might carry 4 spells at highest level if you only choose spell slots,and inventories are small, its very easy to search what you need in the sheets. And theres not a  rain of stuff you need to choose when creating a character. There are no racial buffs nor backstory items(although the GM can choose to give you) so it's roughly 10 minutes to make a character (which is quite the good time).
So with this in mind, i highly recommend you buy Maze Rats. 
This is my first post on here,and i'm open to suggestions and such.

rpg,t3_9zk4es,Questions on collecting the older editions of DnD,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/9zk4es/questions_on_collecting_the_older_editions_of_dnd/,"['First of all, aside from the original 3 booklets that TSR first published in 1974, you\'ll have a hard time pinpointing a ""first edition"" before 2nd. If you want more information on the various editions of old school D&amp;D, Wikipedia and this answer on rpg stack exchange is probably your best bet: [https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/13212/what-are-the-big-differences-between-the-dd-editions](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/13212/what-are-the-big-differences-between-the-dd-editions)  \n\n\nSecond, if you only had to pick one set of books, the 1st edition AD&amp;D books have Gygax himself answering what D&amp;D is about, with lots of detail. Matt Finch\'s free A Quick Primer for Old School Gaming is probably a good supplement to look at first, and even a quick read-through of Swords &amp; Wizardry: Complete will give you an idea of how the game was run (partly with a Do-It-Yourself attitude).   \n\n\nKeep in mind, the ""Basic"" line of D&amp;D is just as important as the ""Advanced"" line it was running parallel to. Tom Moldvay and David Cook\'s ""Basic"" and ""Expert"" (BX) sets are still considered by many to be the best distillations of old school D&amp;D. The Basic line was rebooted soon afterwards and expanded by Frank Mentzer into 5 box sets (BECMI), then compiled in the Rules Compendium (RC). Buying Moldvay/Cook BX and the Mentzer RC books would probably cover this line pretty well.  \n\n\nThe original 3 books, plus their eventual supplements (OD&amp;D), are not to be forgotten. however, nor is the first attempt at a version for teaching new players (Eric Holme\'s ""Basic D&amp;D"", commonly referred to as ""Holmes D&amp;D).  \n\n\nFor 2nd edition, the first version and the ""revised"" versions are essentially the same, minus some errata and reorganization, though some prefer the first version because of the ""superior"" art.  \n\n\nSomeone more knowledgeable can answer in more depth about 3rd edition, but I suspect 3.5 would be fine.  \n\n\nFor settings: Greyhawk and Forgotten Realms are the classic settings. The most popular alternative settings are Dragonlance (as you mentioned), Ravenloft, Dark Sun, Planescape, Spelljammer, and later Eberron. Mystara, a setting that started with the ""Basic"" line, is a cult favorite. There are other settings, such as Al-Qadim, some of which got rolled into Greyhawk or Forgotten Realms.  \n\n\nA few other resources that are helpful (or at least were helpful to me) for understanding the older editions of D&amp;D:\n\n* RPG Crawler\'s  explanation of Old School D&amp;D: [https://youtu.be/isb4RQjHt8E](https://youtu.be/isb4RQjHt8E)\n* An Questing Beast Interview with Jon Peterson, historian of the formation of D&amp;D: [https://youtu.be/wZCGxPRAHEc](https://youtu.be/wZCGxPRAHEc)\n* Matthew Colville\'s The History of D&amp;D, One Fighter at a Time series, starting with: [https://youtu.be/nnjA4D0Z4pM](https://youtu.be/nnjA4D0Z4pM) (not always historically accurate, but gives key insights nonetheless).\n* Plot Points podcast where ""Ben recorded a seminar wherein six game designers who worked on Dungeons and Dragons (Skip Williams, Jon Pickens, Zeb Cook, Ed Stark, Steve Winter, and Mike Mearls) talk about game design"" in Five Generations of D&amp;D design: [http://plotpoints.libsyn.com/98-five-generations-of-dd-design](http://plotpoints.libsyn.com/98-five-generations-of-dd-design)  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;', ""Basic and 1st edition AD&amp;D are two separate game lines.\n\nThere are also numerous versions of basic - the Holmes Blue Box (which doesn't seem to have a DM's Guilde pdf), [B/X Moldvay/Cook](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/110274/DD-Basic-Set-Rulebook-B-X-ed-Basic), [BECMI](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/116619/DD-Basic-Set--DMs-Rulebook-BECMI-ed-Basic), [Rules Cyclopedia](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/17171/DD-Rules-Cyclopedia-Basic) (which is an organized version of BECMI), etc. There are numerous versions of basic, but the Holmes, B/X, and BECMI sets are kind of the three main versions of Basic D&amp;D.\n\nYou also cannot forget [original D&amp;D](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/28306/ODD-Dungeons--Dragons-Original-Edition-0e), which is commonly referred to as the White Box.\n\nD&amp;D's editions can be a little wonky to understand, as some are just re-edits of existing rules, and Basic ran in parallel with Advanced.\n\nThe [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons) isn't a bad place to start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"", 'Basic and Advanced D&amp;D are two different games that both sprang from original D&amp;D. Though they are largely compatible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""Basic D&amp;D"" is really just ""D&amp;D"" but is called basic because that is the name of the introductory rules box in the most well known editions of it. Basic was originally very popular in the early 80s but, particularly as the D&amp;D fad wore off, it became viewed as the ""dumbed down"" or ""kid"" version of D&amp;D (this is true to an extent, BECMI Basic in particular was written with kids in mind) and this combined with the Basic D&amp;D quirk of having race-as-class (Elf, Halfling and Dwarf are *classes* in Basic D&amp;D. Every other core class like Fighter, Cleric etc. is a human.) meant that by the end of the 80s AD&amp;D had eclipsed Basic in popularity, and the Basic line was dead by the time Wizards of the Coast bought TSR. Since there was no longer a ""basic"" line to distinguish from Advanced, and because AD&amp;D had been more popular and well know by then anyway, WotC dropped the ""Advanced"" name and just called 3.0 ""D&amp;D"".', ""D&amp;D and AD&amp;D are two different things.

Disclaimer: I work for the company that owns Scarred Lands.\n\nIt was one of the first third-party settings of the d20 era. The Creature Collection actually beat WotC\'s 3e Monster Manual to market. I like it because a lot of D&amp;Disms are sort of baked into the setting instead of just being there. Fr\'ex:\n\n* There are eight gods, so ""alignment"" is largely a code of behaviour that reflects a certain god above another. \n* Druids are treated as sort of clerics, but for the Titans instead of gods. This is the age of Denev (Gaia-equivalent), so druidic powers are based on nature and plant and animal life. But in the previous age, druids wielded powers of flame and magma. If and when the age of Denev comes to an end, druidic abilities will once again change.\n* Using magic generates heat, which is why wizards can\'t wear armour: it\'d cook them alive.', 'Having been there I can offer how we percieved it at the time\n\nOD&amp;D is pretty distinctive and easy to discern.

At any rate, there was a period where we were playing a hybrid of OD&amp;D and AD&amp;D. I consider AD&amp;D to be ""1st edition""\n\nBasic D&amp;D came out late in the AD&amp;D run and we considered it to be the ""D&amp;D with training wheels"" rather than a game in its own right.

But how I understood it at the time is OD&amp;D begat AD&amp;D begat 2nd Edition AD&amp;D, etc. And the Basic line was an intro to AD&amp;D 1st edition - but now I understand it is distinct. \n\nBecause both are distinct, as you delve into that old stuff we used to play, you are looking at different experiences: Those of us who started with OD&amp;D or AD&amp;D and those of us who got the Basic Box and proceeded from there. Im not saying either is superior! Just that some of our stories start with ""I got the Basic Box for Christmas"" and others of us started with ""What the fuck are these brown booklets? where is the board for this game?"" or ""I gotta buy THREE hard bound textbooks to play this?""\n\n\nEdit: to be more pertinent to your question - get both AD&amp;D books and Basic, Expert, etc. They are different in their approaches. AD&amp;D is High Gygaxian when Gary was in his prime - filled with his unique prose, commandments and opinion. Holmes and Moldvay stuff is entirely their own thing and worth looking at just for another style\n', 'The 4e Dark Sun book is great as is the Planes Above book (not the Planes Below imo).

I'm running a Kickstarter campaign to try to provide a solution for this under-served market. I hope some of you will [check it out](https://kck.st/2Qc56rT).",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/9zjmal/kickstarter_a_possible_turnkey_solution_for/,['Why is this a Kickstarter?']

Cortex Hackers Guide has the system itself available for use without the Smallville licensing.\n\nHillfolk/Blood on the Snow uses the DramaSystem explicitly for power dynamics.  Players are put in the position of Petitioner and Granter with favours traded that drive the story.\n\nExalted 3rd Edition has just about my favourite social combat system.  Characters have several Minor Virtues, fewer Major Virtues, and one Defining Virtue.  Each grade of Virtue opens up levels of favours one could ask for; provided the request aligns to those Virtues.  Players can also use those Virtues to refuse overtures if applicable.  Virtues are kept secret and can only be revealed through roleplay, through a Discern Motive roll, or through various Charms (powers).  \n\nIt's a system that encourages players to learn more about other character or NPCs so as to tailor their approach, avoiding the logical argument and instead getting into character needs/wants."", 'I know I\'ve shilled for it before, but **Burning Wheel** is perfect for political games.\n\nIts social combat engine, ""Duel of Wits,"" is relatively complex but is imo a great way to model arguments.\n\nThe game is centered on the PCs\' beliefs, but everyone also has a network of relationships that are defined by how they tie into the game.\n\nFrankly, the game turned me and my group into a bunch of dramawhores.', 'Everything on this page: https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/wiki/realmrpgs/\n\nStart with Reign.', '*Stars Without Number*\n\nDownload the free version of the rules.

Each game had something similar, but what I recall from long games of the newer Vampire is that everyone has the option for Status in their Clan and Status in their Political Faction, so you could get interesting scenarios where rival political groups put aside their differences because the members were of the same Clan and were bound by certain honor to work on some task. Then it usually fell back to fighting again. Certain Titles handed out by the Prince, became politicized, the ""Sheriff"" or the ""Hound"" usually being a popular one, since the player who enforces the Law, can often interpret it or look the other way. \n\n""Cold City"" is a bit more espionage themed, but more importantly ""Hot War"" is very political. But both systems have Trust mechanics and encourage players with secret agendas to effect their game world and change the power dynamics of Nations or Factions by trading in weird technology or destroying it. The PCs may end up betraying one another or sabotaging each other\'s efforts using Trust (The more you trust someone, the better it is to work together with them for a bonus, but the more devastating it is when they betray you), which creates very political situations. I adapt this mechanic occasionally to other games to make them feel more political. \n\nFATE system, while not bound in any specific setting, is a pretty good one since you can make ""Social Attacks"" to demoralize your foes, which can be anything from embarassing them in court, spreading a foul rumor, mentally dominating them with seduction, feeding someone propaganda or threatening them with violence, etc. You could run political intrigue with it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;', '[deleted]', 'The Song of Ice and Fire RPG has some cool intrigue mechanics.']"

I\'ll also do character creation for games like Apocalypse World, where the creation process is so simple.

For example, don't make a starship pilot with a bunch of cool piloting maneuvers, if the adventure isn't going to take place near spaceships.\n* If it's a deadly game, have a backup if you think theres a possibility a PC could die.\n* Put a timer on the adventure, in-game, to keep things moving forward. If the PCs need to save the president's daughter from ninjas before Christmas morning, keep track of time narratively. That way, one way or another, the story comes to an end, and your one-shot doesn't become a two or three session adventure.\n* Keep the pace up.

In the game, a player can join a religion and become a cleric or paladin; or receive warrior training and become a warrior; or learn magic from a wizard and get the ability to cast spells. That way the players can get specific roles in game, without wasting time doing character creation. In game, the players can be asked by npcs about their background. Some players have intricate backgrounds that they've come up with beforehand, others don't care about that as much, and essentially play as themselves, which seems to work out just fine.\n\nWhen I include ability scores, players can roll for their ability scores when they become relevant during the game--such as rolling 3d6 for strength the first time they do a strength check. I tend to do a more old school style game, and don't do that many checks in general. Players have to find creative ways to do things, rather than just doing say a Diplomacy check, etc. Charisma in my opinion is more about a character's physical beauty and magnetism.

*There are other ephemeral arts -- dance, for example  -- but dance can be performed before large audiences.  In role playing games, the audience are also the performer, in a performance that is inherently limited to a few players.  It's hard for someone not involved in the game to appreciate the group creation, since it's not directed outward toward an audience, and this limits its wide appeal.""* ​

While the game itself is largely made for those at the table; those listening, and/or watching, are still able to partake in without having a direct impact on the story. They are able to passively witness others being active, and that's just something weird to think about. They can theorize along with the party with what's going to happen, and so on.
