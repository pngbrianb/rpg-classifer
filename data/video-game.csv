rpg_gamers,t3_a7l9u2,"Why are there so few Time Traveling RPGs?Chrono Trigger is celebrated as one of the most popular retro RPGs of all time, dominating all kinds of top ten lists, and it's certainly not hard to see why, it has great characters, great mechanics, and a great story, but it's hard to deny that the *Time Travel* theme played a big role in it's success.

Yet despite this, time travel is a largely absent plot in many RPGs, or if it is present is less about specific time periods throughout history and more about interacting with the future or past of a world with no real discernible difference in technology/culture, it's just a then, now, and later situation.

So I have to ask the question: WHY?

The best answer I can hypothesize is that time travel stories that go across multiple time periods are hard to write, especially without feeling derivative. I mean we need a reason for our character(s) to go to medieval Europe one moment, to prehistoric dinosaur times the next, and carry on their journey through ancient antiquity, all the way up to post-apocalypse. The fewer time periods you have, the easier it is to chart this journey, but the less significant the time travel element then seems.

In addition to just the proper catalyst for why they are going to these very specific points in time, you have the nature of time travel to deal with and the inevitable amount of potential problems that time travel would cause. Do you address these issues or ignore them? Do you clarify what happens in this present if you change something in the past? Is it a single linear timeline or a quantum universe of infinite possible branching timelines?

So certainly it must be difficult to write a time travel story, but not impossible, and the theme is certainly popular enough to warrant an attempt, yet it's not very often explored.

The other aspect I think might be a contributing factor is the difficulty from a game design viewpoint. The world map in Chrono Trigger is rather small by RPG standards, but it exists across 5 time eras that you can explore so you see the world in multiple states, and after a certain point can backtrack to whatever time period you like, and are given optional objectives to incentivize it. From a more modern standpoint, where RPGs keep going for bigger and better, it means more work overall as you are designing not one single world, but a new iteration of that world for each subsequent time period you wish to be explored, and you need to be able to not only show how time has changed a certain place but provide tangible gameplay reasons for why the player would want to revisit time periods they have already been to. Time Travel in a linear RPG is certainly possible, but the very nature of time travel is to break linearity and be able to access different points and see the results. The further you explore this concept, the more complex your game becomes.

If you look at the [wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_containing_time_travel) of time travel games it seems like there's quite a few, though a lot of them are either A) not RPGs, or B) only explore a small section of time in two states (past and future), with the exceptions like Chrono Trigger numbering very small.

A lot of games I feel opt instead for the theme park world instead where you have civilizations existing in very different levels of technological and cultural progress that are separated only by distances, not completely unrealistic by any means, but certainly not the same thing as Time Travel.

What are your thoughts? What other time travel RPGs have you played? Why do you think there are so few of them? What would be your ideal Time Travel RPG?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/a7l9u2/why_are_there_so_few_time_traveling_rpgs/,"['Time travel generally is difficult to write well, not just in a game. It\'s difficult to have a story consistent with a stable causality. For example, once you introduce the ability to change the past or see the future, it becomes very contrived to not use that all the time to solve every conceivable story conflict.\n\nA game has a bit of an extra complication, in that you need to make the time travel meaningful to the player by giving them agency. If you make it so that nothing in each timezone affects any other timezone (e.g. something the character does in the past does not change the world of the future), then what purpose did having time travel serve? You could have just had the setting be entirely detached planets/parallel realities and avoided the causation issues with the narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, if you make it so that player agency matters across time, you end up back with the ""why can\'t this solve all problems?"" issue.\n\nChrono Trigger, and some other games, strike a good balance with this - in CT, you still have time travel that the player uses and meaningfully affects the world (i.e. things you do in one age change the state of the later ages), but there are constraints to the time travel mechanism that make narrative sense and prevent the players using time travel to solve everything (because you can only travel through gates which are locked a certain temporal distance apart).\n\nAnother good example is Radiant Historia, which uses a slightly different chronology structure but has the same balance of player agency and narratively sensible limitation om travel (only to certain points in time that were particularly important to the overall timeline), although it functions more like a parallel-universes model.', ""Play Dark Chronicle (Dark Cloud 2 in America), it has great storytelling about time travelling and consequences done in past instances of places in the future. It's my favorite game"", '&gt; Why do you think there are so few of them?\n\nMain reason? It\'s a very, very fringe genre and thus unattractive to write/develop for.\n\nBonus reasons:\n\n- They are an impossibility, unless you remove player agency. Time travel works in any game that is predetermined in its course. Adventure games, platformers, static RPGs. You solve the ""time travel"" puzzle or you don\'t progress. There are no ""unintended consequences"". Can\'t be done in an open world game like Skyrim.\n- Even then, writing good time travel stories is difficult.\n- If you create a world where time travel is possible, you have to create a ton of additional content (past and present versions), unless you limit the scope of time travel. The more you limit the scope, the less of a point there is to having a time travel story.\n- It\'s usually easier to invoke some other gimmick - parallel worlds for example - that has the same net result with fewer downsides.\n\n', 'The type of time travel in Chrono Trigger is clearly influenced by the Back to the Future trilogy of films. Another big 90s game that tackled the concept similarly was Day of the Tentacle.\n\nI think the reason why we don\'t see this type of time travel often in modern games is because it takes a lot more work. CT had a world with something like 3 small towns, so going from the prehistoric period to the middle ages to the future and beyond effectively meant creating an amount of content comparable to one more crowded 16-bit era JRPG world. FF6 probably has more towns and NPCs total than CT, for example. \n\nNow imagine trying to take the same approach with a modern open-world RPG, like Skyrim or The Witcher 3. In order to be able to make 4-5 different time period versions of that open world, it would have to be drastically smaller or less detailed (or both). Would that be appealing to the fans? Hey, play as Geralt fighting dinossaurs, robots and 90s yuppies, but now the ""world"" is basically an island!', ""Probably because coming up with a solid time travel story and setting is hard enough to do without things getting all convoluted.  Then you either have to go the route of ignoring the specifics of how time travel works scientifically and rolling with the fact you're now in a different era of time, or having to go the Star Trek route of technobabble and explaining things through dialogue or talking to some different NPCs.  Because games are interactive compared to something like TV shows or movies, you have to be able to account for so many variables there if making something other than a linear railroaded game."", 'Evoland 2 had some time travel and I at least enjoyed it all the way through', 'Time travel should be avoided like the plague unless you have a really strong concept for it.', ""I was surprised not to see [Ultima II: Revenge of the Enchantress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_II:_The_Revenge_of_the_Enchantress) on that list.  Created by Richard Garriott in 1982, it is probably the very first RPG videogame to feature time travel, *ever*.\n\nSadly, it doesn't hold up well today.  The five different time periods are largely empty of things to do, and actions in one period do not affect others.  As a result, the extra space of different worlds feels like padding.  The same goes with the ability to travel to different planets: there's nothing important on any of them, so there's no real reason to go.  Still, for 1982 it was a big achievement and has an important place in the history of RPGs.\n\nNote: A lot of the game's design was owed to the movie *Time Bandits*, which Richard Garriott was obsessed with at the time."", ""Keep your eye on Destiny Connect, it's supposed to take place in 1999 and feature time travel.

rpg_gamers,t3_a74kmz,"What games put dialogue and story above gameplay?I love dialogue in RPGs. If I can talk my way out of a risky situation I’ll do It every time. 

I wouldn’t turn down a game that was 100% just dialogue choices.

I love RPGs but I’m just not into combat. Any games you’d recommend for that?


Games that let me do a lot of talking that that I’ve played....

• Bloodlines
• Planescape


Honestly on games with difficult combat I usually just use cheat engine or something to make the combat quick and easy. I know that’s probably blasphemous to some of you, but it’s just not why I play RPGs.


EDIT: This post got way more replies then I was expecting, thank you for all the replies. Always looking for more suggestions, but this gave me a lot. Probably going to try Tyranny and Age of Decadence first.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/a74kmz/what_games_put_dialogue_and_story_above_gameplay/,"['Torment: Tides of Numenera\n\nArcanum has quite a bit of that too', ""I've played Fallout: New Vegas as a pacifist character. I was able to get him to level 30+ I think without killing anyone, even a bug. I put skill points into medicine, speech, barter, repair, science, stealth, etc. I snuck my way or facetanked straight through enemies that instant aggro and got all my XP from doing quests to heal people, fix things, remedy social situations, etc. There's even a Mormon Fort you can go to with a series of quests that revolve around getting people not to kill each other, get people off drugs, etc.  It was quite amazing to me that you can do that, and it was one of the most interesting things I've done in an RPG.\n\nYou can even beat the main story, including bosses, with some pretty epic speech checks. There are so many creative ways to resolve situations in this game it's ridiculous. In fact, you could even say it's downright stupid to actually fight stuff in most situations. Example: I developed a 1.5 hour speed-run of the game doing all main quests and it was actually faster to go pacifist. \n\nThe DLC stories are a bit different and I was forced to break my pacifism to beat them. But even then you could still do some pretty cool things with speech. \n\n&amp;#x200B;"", ""From a previous comment of mine:\n\n**Age of Decadence**. The player starts in a small town in a post-apocalyptic world, except the world before was closer to the Roman Empire than the Information Age. The mythos is that gods fought it out, leading to the destruction of both the Empire and their enemies. However, it quickly becomes clear that there were some steampunk stuff involved.\n\nAnyway, the player generally seeks to gain the trust of one of the major powers in the region to further their own ambitions. But the great thing is that there is no mandatory path. The player could help any of the factions or none at all. Seek either riches or understanding of what really transpired. Or they could do all of that and try to become more powerful than anyone else.\n\nThere are 3 Noble Houses vying for power, 4 other factions trying to either just survive or supplant the Houses as the Major Power on the region, as well as a few not-so-minor characters and groups that could change the fate of both the player and the other factions in a number of ways.\n\nIn AoD you only command a single character. The combat is absolutely brutal. Death is always permanent (short of a reload, obviously). I've died more times than I've been victorious and it never gets easier.\n\nThe combat is Isometric and Turn Based, so it may not be your cup of tea. Also, the graphics are pretty bad (they were made on Torque). But if you can get past all those problems you are rewarded with one of the most in-depth combat systems of the past years (for cRPGs, anyway).\n\nEvery choice matters, both inside and outside of combat. It's not always worth it to pursue combat though, mostly because there is a very high chance it will end up with you dead, but thankfully you can avoid pretty much any confrontation. Learning which fights to pick and which ones to stay away from is crucial and mastering all the tools that are available to you is the only way of staying alive if you decide to kill your way out of most situations.\n\nOn some playthroughs you may manage to carve your way through an entire battalion of highly trained, highly experienced Imperial Soldiers. On others you can consider yourself lucky for surviving the last Arena match against a single opponent.\n\nThe most interesting part is that the hardest fights are less reliant on your skills than on your tactics and opponents. Your combat prowess may rival the gods, but you can still die just as easily as any schmuck if you are surrounded by a dozen thugs and cutthroats."", ""Pillars of Eternity 1+2\n\nPlay it on the easiest difficulty and turn on all the character's AI's, game will play itself in combat."", 'Alter Ego is a very well written RPG, and has no gameplay at all.\n\nUltima VII is an open-world adventure game masquerading as an RPG, combat there is automatic and very fast, and you will spend most of your time talking to NPCs and exploring. \n\nThe Age of Decadence is also a very dialogue-heavy game, it has extremely challenging combat but you can try a diplomat and avoid it entirely.

Commonly goes on sales for super cheap as well and is IMO worth its full price. \n\nThere are missions you can take for various factions in the game and a large chunk of them are product delivery through hostile territory or picking up and delivering a cache that multiple factions are vying for. Most of these can be done without actually fighting and just having a fast ship. \n\nThe writing isn't fantastic but it has its own charm with a whole bunch of space ruffians running the show.  Haven't gotten terribly far in the main story so it may get better or worse though. "", 'Dragon Age.

If you want a nice story, you can read a book, watch a radio show (still exists), or watch a movie. \n\nWhat makes games games is their ability to let the player\'s action be the story. When you talk about a game and you say ""and then \'you\' do X and Y"" you know you might as well have turned that game in a movie. The person is basically describing a theme park ride, knowing exactly what that other person will experience as well if they go through the motions. When you talk to your friends about ""and then \'I\'/\'we\' did X and Y"" you know that the fun that person had was a result of actions they chose to make, not just what the game told them to do. \n\nThis to me is why gameplay is and always should be the most important aspect of a game. A story is great for a setting, like a general premise or for world building, or even for very generic goals that gives the player the motivation to actually play the game, but when you start telling me what my character is saying/feeling, then I quickly lose interest.

So far we have beaten Persona 5(115 hours) and Xenoblade 2(90 hours) and started Dragon Quest XI(3 hours in). Games we are going to be playing include but no limited to are; Final Fantasy 12,10,9,8,7 and 6, Shin Megami Tensei V on release, Ni no Kuni™ I and Ni no Kuni™ II plus meny more.

I feel like there is no voice for the JRPG and RPG Community on twitch and instead of waiting for someone else to create a community with a voice we can all get behind. I through would create one.

If you think I need to play a specific game please let me know and if you would like to jump in and help with our community playthrough of more JRPGS please hit the follow button.

rpg_gamers,t3_a6hamg,"I've recently discovered I love CRPGs. I feel like a whole new world has opened to me.I was born in the 80s and always heard of games like baldur's gate etc, but never really got into them or tried them.  I've always been into competitive games and played alot of games like counterstrike 1.6 and brood war.

Recently I became a dad and my desire to game went way down.. For awhile I didn't play much of anything, so I started watching more twitch streams and things like that.  

I was watching CohhCarnage (twitch) play pathfinder kingamer, and remember I already owned divinity original sin 2 (bought it on a whim sometime ago but never played).. I decided I should give it a go...

WELL, It BLEW ME AWAY!  I couldn't believe the freedom I had to solve problems any way I wanted.  Right after I finished DOS 2 I played Pillars of Eternity and I absolutely loved that too (more for the story).

I found I love creating my own character and exploring these worlds.

After playing those 2 games I have purchased:

* Wasteland 2 (for my switch if I'm travelling)
* Baldurs gate 1 &amp; 2 (on android I'm playing on my chromebook)
* Tyranny (currently playing on PC)
* Pillars of Eternity 2 (maybe next?)
* Planescape Torment (bought this on PC, not sure when I'm going to play it)
* Pathfinder Kingmaker (saving for last so the bugs get ironed out)

Basically I have a great Queue of games I'm really looking forward to playing. Just really wanted to tell some people! It's going to take me awhile because I still don't play all that often now that I'm a dad, but If anybody has some other great ones I should get let me know!


EDIT:

OK ya'll.  Thanks for all the great recommendations so far.  I am a crazy person and just bought tons more games.  I'm pretty sure I'm getting carried away with the amount of games I now have in my queue.

I bought:

* 4 of the Ultima games
* Neverwinter nights 2
* Underrail
* Shadowrun DragonFall
* The entire avernum series (it was only 1.49 on GOG)
* Arcanum (I'll play this eventually once I feel like a veteran of crpg games)
* fallout 1 &amp; 2
* Betrayal at Krondor (nobody recommended this, but I saw it and remembered watching my older brother play it when I was a kid and wanted to check it out)
* Dragon age origins because so many people said I should check it out.
* Might and magic 6-8

I now have a huge list to run through but I'm sure I'll keep adding to it as I see and hear about other games I should play.

And when it does finally get more complex and offer some variety with different character forms and stuff later on, you\'ll probably need to read up on a guide to figure out the kinks without spending forever to try figuring it out.\n\n* Shortened item names give them some weird looking abbreviations.

From the bits of let\'s play footage I\'ve watched, the sequels do seem like they make improvement off of the first game so I may give them a try at some point.  The 2nd game\'s graphics and interface alone seem like a big step up from the first one and both are on the SNES.\n\nAs for some of my favorites on SNES, the usual stuff like Chrono Trigger, but also something different like Front Mission (fan translated).  I\'ve never played any of the Fire Emblem SNES games but Fire Emblem on GBA was essentially a remake/re-release of one of the SNES Fire Emblem games to my understanding so I\'d say that\'s another of my favorites.']"

rpg_gamers,t3_a5xjk8,"Wine and Cheese: How I came to love The Bard's Tale IVHere's a review of my first 5 hours in The Bard's Tale IV: Barrows Deep.

It's past midnight and I should be in bed, but I just have to see what's around the corner. Currently I'm exploring the labyrinthian oldtown underneath the city of Skara Brae, which I've dubbed the Underbrae. I was chased down here by a gang of medieval Nazis, for the crime of going to the pub. That's as much backstory as I have time for, because right now there's a big, burly demon standing in my way. Earlier in the game I witnessed three warlocks sacrificing themselves to summon him, and now he's patrolling the area I want to explore. I hesitate for a moment. Then I charge in.

This is an immensely stupid idea. The game clearly doesn't intend for me to go this way for a long while yet, in fact I'm barely even out of the tutorial. My two-man army consists of a mentally unstable dwarf named Grong, and a gnomish creature known as a trow, whose name is Wringneck. My opponent has a gigantic health bar adorned with a red skull to really hammer home what a badass he is, and he looks like he could pancake us both in a single smash. The game discreetly offers me the option to surrender without a fight. I respectfully decline.

Grong, my main character, is a Bard, which is a magical musician of sorts. He can drink booze to give himself inspiration, and use it to play songs that have various effects in battle. If he drinks more than his Intelligence allows for, he gets Smashed. This briefly doubles his Strength, but leaves him Stunned and unable to do anything on the next turn. Bards typically want a high Intelligence to get the most out of their musical talents, but Grong walks a different path. His instrument is a mug, his song a burp, and his lyrics are the ramblings of a drunkard.

I start the fight by having Wringneck toss Grong a potion, which he gulps down. Since I gave Wringneck the Alchemy talent he's able to concoct powerful tonics from common herbs, and this one greatly boosts the imbiber's Strength. Grong then chugs another drink, a bottle of Elven Wine. Those are quite expensive, but Grong has the Brewer talent which lets him cook up barrels of the stuff. Moreover, I've purposely kept his Intelligence at rock bottom, so he immediately gets shitfaced from one swig. His potion-augmented Strength is now doubled, meaning he hits like a freight train when he attacks. This lets him do some serious damage with his triple sword slash ability, which would otherwise be hampered by the demon's thick armor.

But that's not all. Before my turn ends, Grong toots a tune of valor on his horn. This usually gives him a few extra health points, but because the ability scales up with Strength it now bestows a massive barrier of alcoholic fortitude, nearly tripling his health bar. Wringneck follows up by slinking off into the shadows, becoming untargetable. The demon has no choice but to swing his axe at Grong, and normally this would cleave him in half, but in his drunken stupor Grong shakes it off like dandruff.

Now it's my turn again. Grong got Smashed the previous round, so he's in for a hangover. But Grong is a dwarf, and dwarves are immune to being Stunned, which means he can act freely! He downs another bottle of wine and gets blasted off his rocks again, muscles bulging with booze-fueled power. His triple sword slash is still recharging, but Grong has a final trick up his wine-stained sleeve. He belches out a verse called Rhythm of Duotime, which shaves a turn off of all recharge timers for the entire party. This lets him swing his sword yet again, and also enables Wringneck to throw him another potion before skulking back into the shadows.

A few more rounds of drunken asskicking and the demon falls, without ever landing a scratch on my adventurers. It drops a very good helmet which I sadly cannot use, mainly because it increases my Intelligence and so would deprive me of my dipsomantic superpowers. I also get enough experience to level up, and I immediately invest the skill point in increasing my Strength even further. It seems like Grong is destined for greatness indeed. Battle by battle he shall conquer the Underbrae, with a song on his lips, a potion in his belt and an industrial-sized barrel of booze strapped to his back.

rpg_gamers,t3_a5wpdl,"Is it safe to finally admit that The Witcher 3 wasn't really good? After playing Breath of the Wild, my perspective on TW3 has completely shifted. I tried going back and I just couldn't spend more than 20 minutes without getting bored. The combat is shallow and repetitive. Geralt controls like shit. He runs into walls all the time and just won't fucking stand still at a stop. Roach REALLY controls like shit. Thank god you don't actually have to do horse combat. You have to follow a smell in nearly every quest, so there's very little quest variety. Too many ubisoft-esque collectables and markers. There is no incentive whatsoever to clear out monster nests. It's just there to pad out the game. Gwent is unbalanced. Thankfully it isn't an integral part of the game, but if you have all the legendaries than you have a zero percent chance to lose. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Witcher 3 also isn't a true RPG. Say what you will about Skyrim, but you could at least do whatever the fuck you wanted. You weren't restricted to a certain play style whatsoever. You could be a total fucking shithead if you wanted to, killing almost anyone you want. In Witcher 3, you have to play it the way the game wants you to. You have to be the good guy. You can't slice up some cheating gwent fuck. Every Bethesda RPG by default is a better RPG than The Witcher 3. I think Witcher 3 is a better game than Fallout 4 like most people, but it can't touch Fallout 4 as an RPG.

I agree that it was not a chin scratching strategy game, where you have to consider your stats and gear and all that.

BG2 and Planescape Torment are two of the best RPGs of all time and you can't really go wrong.\n\nEdit: I will add to this by saying that Planescape is more story focused, and probably has more player agency.

It’s an RPG adventure that has a lot of heart, a lot of laughs and a LOT of excellent gameplay refined over decades. The story has a lot of twists and turn and often will zig when you expect it to zag. Even in the moments where the plot goes in an obvious direction, the excellent characters’ and their chatter make every cutscene a lot of fun. \n\nMy favourite aspect of the game is of course the combat. Every character can be customised to suit your liking, but not too much to feel overwhelming. It’s very easy to see the characters as puzzle pieces that can fit together to solve the game’s tricky fights. The game’s animations are insanely fun and punchy too, it’s one of those games where I cheer when one of my characters does an enormous amount of damage. \n\nEquipment too has been renovated. You can now craft equipment on a fun-sized forge. There’s a minigame that allows you to get bonus stats on your weapons that’s super fun to master, but without consequence for failure. \n\nI think for me personally, if you play with the “stronger monsters” option turned on (easy to miss, can be found while inputting a name) makes it so the game’s difficulty is PERFECT and you can give the game your all without having to avoid random encounters to avoid being overlevelled.\n\nFinally the world is SO much fun to explore. It’s like every nook and cranny have been filled with at least something to reward dedication from its players. Even if not, just chatting to NPCs is rewarding, can often be quite funny and also links the world together as the people from round the world will \n\nSo all in all, a fantastic RPG with great characters, fun gameplay, funny and sad moments and a fascinating world. I’d say you should pick this up immediately if you have any interest in seeing a classic JRPG updated for modern times without removing any of what made the originals special. \n\nSorry if I typed a lot, DQ is a series I have a huge personal attachment to, and I think dqxi is a goddamn masterpieces, I don’t care what anyone says.

rpg_gamers,t3_a47ced,"Recommendations for someone who knows nothing?I’ve heard so many good things about RPGs from a new friend I’ve made. I’m just new to all video games in general. I understand it stands for role playing games but I’m not sure what an RPG consists of. Here’s a list of all of video games I have ever played and maybe someone could give me recommendations based upon that? This is all for the PS4

Red Dead Redemption 2, Assassins Creed Odyssey &amp; Origins, Fallout 4, Call of Duty WW2 &amp; Black Ops 3, GTAV, and some random sports games

I grew up very poor so I’ve never owned any type of PC or a console until last year when I bought a PS4. I’ve been looking into building a PC but that’s way over my head and budget.

https://www.pcgamer.com/the-outer-worlds-is-a-new-first-person-sci-fi-rpg-from-obsidian-and-the-creators-of-fallout/#comment-jump

Steam description:

The Outer Worlds is a new single-player first-person sci-fi RPG from Obsidian Entertainment and Private Division. 

In The Outer Worlds, you awake from hibernation on a colonist ship that was lost in transit to Halcyon, the furthest colony from Earth located at the edge of the galaxy, only to find yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy it. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable. 

Key Features

* The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.
* You can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.
* Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.
* Explore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony’s two planets didn’t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon.

The game is a parody of the Anime/Manga Goblin Slayer but... with Slimes.

Right now the length of the game is between 7-10 minutes (skipping dialogues), i has planned to publish the next versión in 2 weeks with 2 more missions.

The game is in spanish but do not have to much text (and is in a easy spanish, you can translate easy with the Google translate)

- I'm pretty sure it's a well known title

- the game starts in a small village, and you have to do a couple of I think competitions (i recall one with archery and another one I think with apples in a barrel???)
- then an attack occurs on the village
- nearby there is a shrine thing with a door you can't open (geez - that's a useless bit of info I know. but i can picture the damn thing... it's in a swamp).

rpg_gamers,t3_a1llcw,"Playing through action RPGS - Two Worlds update. Starting VeneticaI made a post 2 weeks ago about how I felt [Two Worlds should get a little more love](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9wsot7/i_feel_like_two_worlds_and_its_sequel_dont_get/) then it gets. Since then Ive been on a bit of an action RPG bender. I finished a play through of Two Worlds 1 since then and Im going to use that as my basis of comparison for other action RPG games. I also dont like the term ""action RPG"" as I think its to broad for this particular niche of RPGs. I cant think of an alternative though.


To start off with - **Corrections/Updates from my Two Worlds (TW) thoughts.**

For combat, the weapon/armor/enchantment stacking seems to have diminishing returns and I cant say at what rate or what the formula for it is though its still a satisfying mechanic except in the case of stacking staves. Theres no stat increase bonus there and melee damage is wasted on a mage. Rings with the same icon can be combined with others that have different bonuses up to a limited amount of times.

Stat points are Health, Strength, Dex, and Will power. The game doesn't tell you that Dex is needed to hit enemies. I went from 1-40 without pumping anything into dex then suddenly I saw I had a 40% chance to hit enemies. I pumped the next 10 levels of stat points into that and got it up to around 66% chance to hit.

I did a few magic tests with the few cards I found. I only found 5 heal cards throughout the game but after maxing water magic mastery I went from 600 health a cast to 6000 health a cast and with a few boosts added an extra 1000 health to that. With alchemy I had more than enough mana to cast healing for days. The summon I used to help in a tough fight was useless but bless and another self buff from the water school helped increase my damage.

There are merchants around but good luck finding a merchant with your exact weapon and the spells your looking for during most of the game. Towards the last 3/4s of it you could find several that have the same weapon types. It will get expensive to stack damage but it can be worth it. Tip - Go for 2 handed over 1 handed.

At one point about 1/3rd to 1/4 of the world is a wasteland with nothing to do other then killing the oddly placed creature. Its explained there were villages there until the war and the orcs razed it all. By that point with it feeling so empty I didn't bother to stop off at the two side areas to do quests. Well, I did but the first quest there was to kill a dragon. Despite the dragon being yellow in name (green=supposed to be easy, yellow=your level or slight challenge, red=LOL) I could hardly scratch it and got 1 hit. 

The first half of the main story quest is run here, talk to X. The last half of the main story quest is run and gather these 5 items. Some require favor to get access to, other you can waltz in and deal with combat. Its possible to grab some of those items before you get the quest to get them as I grabbed 3 of the 5 without realizing it. 

I went for the ""evil"" ending this time which was more difficult and more fulfilling then the ""good"" ending. Still, I will probably play it again.

Performance wise it got worse, way worse, in city (not village) areas with multiple NPCs to the point that the games internal clocks was getting off. I noticed that save times were not matching up with my computer when I was saving. It was painfully slow to move around. Moving the camera around seemed to help or make it worse depending on how many NPCs were loaded into view.

I will still play it again.


**Venetica** 

I bought this on 360 several years ago as it came up as a game like TW and Risen. I recently bought it on sale on Steam for about $2.50. Its combat is similar to both games but simpler. Its interfaces while not clunky are not smooth. The voice acting isn't stellar and sounds are off. Part of me is not looking forward to this game in some degree but the other part of me is. It came out 3 years after the PS3 and 4 years after the 360. The graphics so far are not stellar but they are not horrible the environments are cluttered but detailed. While the game doesn't take advantage of the beautiful graphics (so far) that it could provide it makes for some comical character models. I feel like its a gen 6.5 game instead of a gen 7 game which isnt a bad thing. Graphics aside the movement is almost fluid and smooth as butter and I appreciate that.

On level up your given 3 stat points and 20 skill points 1 extra stat point is automatically given to each stat at level u . Skill points are spent in quantities of 10. I dont know why they couldn't just say its 1 point each and leave it at that. Maybe Ill discover more after playing more than 2 hours. Like TW, you are not specifically told what stats do. Wisdom increases mana while mental power increases magic damage. As of playing 2 hours I've only encountered 1 trainer to spend skill points at and he only taught me how to gut monsters for loot, block attacks, and add another combo. 

The story so far is that a prophecies foretells of a blade not of this world that can destroy the undead and its only wieldable by one person from a specific village who has no family. Thats the PC. After the village is attacked you gather your things, do a few quests, and head to the main city. 

I cant comment on magic just yet but I will in the next update.

rpg_gamers,t3_a0x7et,"RPG's with NPC companions and good lootHey there everybody, I'm new around here and doing a little research for myself. I've done some reddit searches to find games that I'm looking for but not giving up in finding out all I can. What I am seeking out is an RPG (Console or PC, even handheld) that kind of gives that MMO feel but is all single player. When I say MMO feel I would say the best I can explain it is a large world to move around and somewhat plays like one. My days of playing games online is over with. I just don't have the time or desire to play with people and I prefer singleplayer now. However I do enjoy when a game has NPC's that help you in your quest, and work with you decently.  So far I've found some games that I think fit what I'm looking for, just trying to see if anyone else has any more suggestions. I like it when games have fun loot to play with, but it's not an absolute must. And believe me when I say I appreciate ANY responses. I know it's sort of an odd question to ask, and there has been others like me that have asked on other boards.

Star wars KOTOR

Final fantasy XII

Dragon age (any of them) and also perhaps more CRPG's such as Baldur's gate, Neverwinter nights etc

Fantasy life

Torchlight

.Hack series

Kingdoms of amalur (this doesn't have companions from what I hear though)  


  
Edit: Sounds like Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen is going to be the ticket. Purchased it for my PS3, thanks folks

Divinity original sin also sounds like a great candidate for my needs.  
",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/a0x7et/rpgs_with_npc_companions_and_good_loot/,"['""Dragon\'s Dogma: Dark Arisen"" is definitely one the games closest to what you\'re looking for. The developer even turned the game concept into a real MMO afterwards. There\'s a large open world which you can travel with your NPCs (Pawns) and they\'ll talk with you or comment on quests/events and you can even customize your main Pawn. They\'ll work together with you as a party to beat monsters in really tactical ways, such as holding down mobs for you to finish off or holding up a shield for you to use a springboard to get a high jump on top of a large monster. There\'s also plenty of cool loot to find and it has a very MMO-ish class system. Plus the boss battles and music are just flat-out amazing and epic. Despite all its faults, it\'s one of the best games ever, in my opinion.\n\nOther than that, ""The Last Remnant"" only has NPCs show up in battle or during cutscenes, but I found exploration in fields and towns to have a really MMO-ish feel to it that is hard to explain. There\'s not really any interesting loot system, but the extremely deep battle system really makes up for it. The game also has a remaster coming out next month, so it might be a good time to pick it up.', ""I don't know excactly what you mean by an mmo feel. But i will just start out by recommending the obvious. Divinity: Original Sin 1 &amp; 2 is absolutely phenomonal. \n\nAs i said, i don't really know what you mean by an mmo feel, but they have good loot and companions. "", ""Dragon's Dogma does NPC helpers in an interesting way - their level is fixed, so as you gain levels you can swap them out for higher-leveled ones. They also have fixed roles, so as you change the class your main character plays, you can fill out the party with different types of helpers. "", ""Dragon's Dogma and FFXV both have a similar feel to their combat and exploration where the AI is constantly helping out or commenting on stuff. DD has more depth to it though.\n\nI would also recommend Xenoblade Chronicles 1. One of the all-time greats, the party members aren't exactly NPCs because you can use any of them as the controllable character, but it's a lot like FFXII in that regard with similar-feeling combat too. Also the story and environments are straight up 10/10."", ""Mass Effect has amazing companions, story, and a big world. It's linear/story driven, though so if you're looking for something open world-ish then maybe not. But I'd still highly reccomend the series. "", 'Hey I would HIGHLY recommend Pillars of Eternity 2 !!  If that has not already been mentioned.  It is exactly what you are describing but might be a little more on the hardcore side. Cheers!  Hope you find what you are looking for!', 'Golden Sun is great! A good amount of loot for a handheld game, including secret loot, puzzles and a really good combat with summons.', 'Definitely Fallout 76. ', ""Probably not what you're looking for, but I'm going to throw this out there. I'm playing Dragon Quest V HD remake on mobile (also on DS), and it's been fun. You have a main character who makes friends that accompany him on quests, then go their separate ways (maybe reunite later? I'm not finished. I only seem to have one permanent NPC in my party).\n\nOne aspect of this game that I haven't seen elsewhere is the ability to recruit monsters into your party. Different monsters have different abilities, so you need to plan out which ones you want to keep in your party vs your wagon. They don't seem integral to the story (like some of the NPCs), but they are essential to winning battles."", 'Fallout is big on companions but they are pretty silent/mostly combat damage multipliers. Dogmeat is an exception, he has high perception and will growl at enemies to alert you. Game is great from loot angle.\n\nMass Effect is better on the character development angle, and you can command team members to move and attack. Loot feels a bit hollow though. This is a lore/story-driven game. ', ""The Sword Art Online series, Specifically Hollow Realization might be right up your alley. It's on PS4 and Steam now I believe. A LOT of Characters whom you can party up with similar to the .Hack series, as well as AI controlled Parties roaming the fields fighting Instances which you can choose to help with or just avoid entirely. There's a bit of a relationship aspect with the game where you can build bonds with characters, something extra to do."", 'Final fantasy XV sounds like what you are after.', 'Dark souls is one of the greatest rpg series ever made, if not the best.', 'https://store.steampowered.com/app/338390/The_Technomancer/', ""Not the most popular title, but if you enjoyed kotor, you might want to try Technomancer. Finished it last month, and I gotta say it's pretty good. Not perfect, mind you, and there is some excessive backtracking in sidequests but still fun. "", 'Souls series?', ""Witcher 3 was one of my favorite solo player experiences. Lots of great side quests, great loot including lots of different gear sets that change your play styles. A really terrific card game with in the game. Really great story telling. \n\nIf you haven't played it, you will not be disappointed.""]"

Lots of burned goodwill over Peter Molyneaux constantly and ambitiously promising the world, but only ever delivering 70% of the features he hyped up, usually 90% the next game in.\n\nFable II is considered the crown jewel.

I'd love to know if you think it's better or worse than Bethesda games. "", ""Different development studios have different strengths. Bethesda has always been pretty good at world building and creating neat dungeons, but believable characters with engaging dialogue has never been strong in their games.\n\nIf you enjoyed how lively and believable Witcher 3's world is, you will like Red Dead Redemption 2. It plays rather similarly to Witcher 3 too. "", ""I like TES for giving me a first person fantasy action-RPG thingy, with custom characters and many different playstyles. Plus you can interact with the world in a pretty direct way; talk to any NPC, a good portion of them have names and unique lines. Move or take any non-static object. Steal the very outfit a character is wearing.\n\nHowever it's weak in so many other areas. The cities are small and empty. The quests, especially come Skyrim, are generic and forgettable. There's no real role-playing aside from deciding to not do certain guilds, but it feels like the games recently push you to do all of them on one character, regardless of playstyle. The minute to minute combat is really lame. It makes sense it's not as good a stealth game as dishonoured, or as good a sword fighting game as... Something else, but it still needs to be better. You can interact with the world in minute ways, but the big scale stuff, or even just dynamic systems are sorely absent. \n\nIn short... It's a jack of all trades, master of none.

But I still felt they were okay.\n\nAt the end of the day, they all seem lifeless to me because I know in the back of my mind they are essentially packages with limited programs of lines and behaviors meant to give the impression of life.\n\nMost characters in Skyrim and Witcher 3 seem lifeless also because they don't transform. They spout a ton of voice-acted lines, and initiate all these animated behaviors in scenes, but that's it. They feel scripted, not alive. It's like watching a puppet show.\n\nMaybe it's nostalgia but the only games where I feel that characters are alive are the KoTOR games. You can sway companions to the light or dark side, which leads to compelling character transformation both in the game and in their character stories.

The first game from the studio that actually hooked me was Fallout 4, in the survival mode, and that\'s because of the action and sandbox elements, not RP at all. I\'ve met Bethesda with Oblivion and Fallout 3 (am a Classic Fallout fan).\n\n1. Their worlds are just huge ctrl+c ctrl+v. They reuse the same houses, monsters, skins, items, furniture, etc... In their whole game world, doesn\'t matter if there are two different cities with completely different cultures and societies, or 20 different oblivion gates you gotta go in, most of the stuff will just be exactly the same all around the game world, save architecture for notable structures and faction armor (sometimes the faction armor is just a reskin).\n2. Lifeless, I feel you man. Their dialogues are poorly written, the voice acting is often terrible, and the engine is old, so it\'s not like the 3d models can make face movements that feel organic.\n3. The enemies and AIs are pretty much equal. In Fallout 4, the only difference between Raiders, Mutants, Gunners, Synths is the weapons they\'re using and the amount of health they have. There\'s no enemy in Fallout 4, Skyrim or Oblivion where you feel like ""Ok, for this enemy I better use this specific appareal or weapon because he\'ll use this and that abilities"", I mean, theoretically the game mechanics are made for this to happen (e.g. synths are weaker to energy, ghosts in skyrim), but the numbers are made in such way that you actually don\'t feel it in the game.\n4. Storytelling: The stories are dull, generic and boring. Seriously, I think that currently, any mainstream medieval fiction story is better than Bethesdas. Story is always plainly explained to the player by any average NPC that somehow know all the details of ancient dragon lore; the character is deemed a pletora of noble titles within 15 minutes of gameplay;  all npcs speak truly and in a very easy to comprehend way; everything in the story is obvious and straightforward, you don\'t even need to understand the story, all you gotta do is follow a pointer in the compass and you\'ll finish the game.\n5. Engine... Well, 7 year old engine, which is a tweak of Gamebryo, a 20 years old engine...\n6. It\'s been some time now (since Oblivion) that Bethesda does games not to make good RPGs, but for people to crawl through endless dungeon killing zombies, messing with ragdoll physics and console to record youtube videos and memes, and mods.\n7. Theoretically, in Bethesdas games you can do a million things and approach things a million different ways... But they all feel exactly the same and have the same results, always, save very tiny changes in some quests. The ""huge"" difference between being a strong warrior or a cunning thief in Skyrim, is that in the first case you\'ll raise your shield until the dragon comes down then you\'ll run to him and bash him, and in the second case you\'ll hide behind a boulder until you can fire arrows at the dragon.\n\nAnyway, I think it all comes down to manpower: Bethesda has a relatively small number of employees of 400, which is relatively small compared to other studios (Half of CDPR), so they pretty much have a big limitation there and that makes their work more recognizable, but they still show some signs of sloppy/lazy work such as the monomodel assets, poor writing and outdated engine. I think they should, instead of ""Our next game will be the map of 3124135 skyrims!!!11"", start focusing on quality and hiring actual writers for their stories.', ""I have a hard time understanding why people love Skyrim so much.

Think hussain, yes he was a bad man who did bad things but knowing what we know now about the rise of extremism can we really say that the world is better off without him in it?\n\nThe choice between good or bad is obvious, but the question is how far are you really willing to go to create the better world?

Mass Effect was my first WRPG. I'd recommend the Mass Effect triology to anyone!"", ""One good starting point that I haven't heard anyone mention is Shadowrun Dragonfall. It's more of a strategy rpg but is loaded with a great story, great world, great choices, great characters, easy to learn combat, and a variety of builds and difficulty settings that add a lot of replayability. Shadowrun Hong Kong is a sort of sequel that is also excellent, and could be used as a starting point."", 'For JRPG players I always recommend Wizardry 8, which is complex enough to please old-school CRPG players, streamlined enough to not annoy newcomers to this genre, has tons of customization options (and very amusing voice acting), and gameplay very close to old-school Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy games (which were inspired by the original Wizardry), while still feeling forward-looking and fresh. ', 'Planescape Torment, you will never find any less rich game ', 'This is a great thread. ', ""Oh, I forgot. Here's a great list from people who know their shit, with some nice mini-reviews: https://rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=9453 \n\nNot that I completely agree with it (I think their top 15 lacks many older classics, and no Bioware game would enter my personal top 100), but I believe it's an excellent guide. "", 'Pillars of Eternity is a great modern take on old school CRPGs', ""You're going to get 10 different answers. I'd say pillars of eternity 2, wasteland 2, or dragon age origins with a mage MC. That said, all of those games are reasonable options."", ""Baldur's Gate 2 for fantasy. Fallout 2 for sci-fi. That should get you started."", ""The answers so far are great for engaging stories and such, but if you just want to go and kill things because they are there to be killed, you can't go wrong with dungeon crawlers like [Dungeon Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master_\\(video_game\\)), the older Wizardry games, Bard's Tales, or newer ones like Legend of Grimrock.\n\nSometimes you don't need side quests and plot points to get ambushed by a party of 20 barbarians.  You simply kill them and move closer to the giant treasure chest at the end of the dungeon."", ""Not Witcher 3? Then Skyrim, he-he.\n\nI like many other games more but they're hard to get into. Skyrim has RPG mechanics but allows you to not get too involved in them. The other game I'd recommend would be Dragon Age Origins but it's more mechanics-heavy and RPG aspects of it may scare people. I mean RPG is all about your choices matter, but for some it may be too close to home. People die, settlements are lost - heavy stuff.\n\nMass Effect is more forgiving but gameplay is very clunky. So if you think you're ready for a slightly more complex mechanics and not-so-scary story then I recommend Divinity Original Sin 2 in addition to Skyrim.""]"
rpg_gamers,t3_9z7zcc,What's your opinions on Dragon Quest 11?I haven't played the series since Dragon Warrior 2 but this latest one is getting rave reviews and as I feel like a lot of the users here are on my wavelength I'd love to hear about some of your experiences with this game.,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9z7zcc/whats_your_opinions_on_dragon_quest_11/,"['It is AMAZING. It’s an RPG adventure that has a lot of heart, a lot of laughs and a LOT of excellent gameplay refined over decades. The story has a lot of twists and turn and often will zig when you expect it to zag. Even in the moments where the plot goes in an obvious direction, the excellent characters’ and their chatter make every cutscene a lot of fun. \n\nMy favourite aspect of the game is of course the combat. Every character can be customised to suit your liking, but not too much to feel overwhelming. It’s very easy to see the characters as puzzle pieces that can fit together to solve the game’s tricky fights. The game’s animations are insanely fun and punchy too, it’s one of those games where I cheer when one of my characters does an enormous amount of damage. \n\nEquipment too has been renovated. You can now craft equipment on a fun-sized forge. There’s a minigame that allows you to get bonus stats on your weapons that’s super fun to master, but without consequence for failure. \n\nI think for me personally, if you play with the “stronger monsters” option turned on (easy to miss, can be found while inputting a name) makes it so the game’s difficulty is PERFECT and you can give the game your all without having to avoid random encounters to avoid being overlevelled.\n\nFinally the world is SO much fun to explore. It’s like every nook and cranny have been filled with at least something to reward dedication from its players. Even if not, just chatting to NPCs is rewarding, can often be quite funny and also links the world together as the people from round the world will \n\nSo all in all, a fantastic RPG with great characters, fun gameplay, funny and sad moments and a fascinating world. I’d say you should pick this up immediately if you have any interest in seeing a classic JRPG updated for modern times without removing any of what made the originals special. \n\nSorry if I typed a lot, DQ is a series I have a huge personal attachment to, and I think dqxi is a goddamn masterpieces, I don’t care what anyone says. Definitely the best game of this year. ', "" I have tried over the years to get into JRPGs and other than Ni No Kuni on the PS3, none really ever drew me in, even the second Ni No Kuni.   \n\nAlready I can tell Dragon Quest XI is a game that I am going to enjoy immensely. I can't put my finger on why it is different than other JRPGs that I have played and didn't enjoy other than being extremely well polished."", ""This game hits the spot when looking for a traditional JRPG. It's the only traditional JRPG in maybe 5 years I've enjoyed. It still pales compared to great WRPGs imo, but it does provide a unique sense of adventure.\n\nHit or miss characters, ok story, great combat, good difficulty balance, great graphics, decent but incredibly overused music, nice character progression. I will say having to hit buttons during voice acted scenes is really asinine."", 'DQXI is a great game.  But all the DQ games are good.  Just different levels of good.  DQXI is in many ways what I expected and wanted DQIX to be.  The way it handles zones, combat, story and the like are all very similar.  But done better in my opinion.  I still like some other DQ games more, but its still a top notch game.  A good game for someone to start the series with.', 'I\'d like to give you a dissenting opinion. I\'ve only played 25 hours of it and I intend on finishing it. But so far, I\'d call this the ""basic bitch"" of JRPG\'s. It\'s supposed to be a throwback to those generic RPG\'s of old so nothing really stands out. I find that the music sucks and that the character and story development are mediocre. The turn based combat is awesome and so is the skill trees. The voice acting is magnificent. Overall, I rate it as average. I keep hoping it gets better, but right now, it\'s just a generic fetch quest to get the dragon balls. ', ""DQ 11 is so good that its audience goes waaaaaay past just people who like Dragon Quest. If you like modernised but still classic-feeling RPGs you really can't go wrong with it."", 'Dragon Quest 11 might just be the best example of a Japanese role-playing game that i have ever played: It’s a great example of the genre, but that doesn’t necessarily make it a great game. It’s been a long time since I played a turn-based JRPG, but my trouble with Dragon Quest 11 wasn’t just the usual adjustment period when starting a new game. It was with the whole game. And it may seem absurd to complain about getting so much for the price, its length raises a comparison between quantity and quality. Dragon Quest 11 too often extols the virtues of the former at the expense of the latter.', 'Is good, would play my 100+ hours again. ', 'A fresh spin on an older style, I really\nEnjoy the mechanics and story telling. Lead character is kinda meh, but that’s what you get with no voice acting. Sylvando and jade are my fav ', 'I tried so hard to get I to DQ 8  in the DS but the combat is so boring it kills me \n\nOctopath on the other hand is soooo good great combat.\n\nI’ll probably buy DQ11 anyway, it just looks cool and way more up to date than dq8', 'I finished it.. and did all the quests.. but I think they game was just “meh”.  I felt the same about DQ8.  Good enough to buy and play, but far from my favourites. \n\n..except those Slimes. I love the little mf’s. ', 'My only gripe is the, in my opinion, God awful bad accents they attempt to pull off. Everything else is great. ']"

But usually I can find at least a redeeming quality in a game that I don\'t like and still finish it just for the story. There is no chance in heck I am revisiting this game or ""seeing the light"" at a later date. I hated the atmosphere, the slow walking, inventory management and even the story telling. The dialogue is atrocious, and the cinematic intro to the game is one of the *worst things I have ever seen in my life.* Think of the intro to the first Resident Evil and add teenage angst.\n\nWas starting my first **Banner Saga** play through since the trilogy was finished, but stopped two hours in after realizing that after years of waiting I can no longer stand turn-based games. The story is incredible and the mechanics are sound, so it still comes highly recommended. I plan on watching let\'s plays of this at a later date. It is REALLY good. \n\nStarted and stopped **Ys I &amp; II Chronicles**. Stopped after four hours in Ys I. Interesting story, but the bump combat, repetition, backtracking and respawning enemies turned me away. This is a case of a game that was probably great in its day but didn\'t age properly. I am still interested in the series, so will be jumping ahead to the later titles.\n\nMy impatience got to me, so started **Red Dead Redemption 1** for the first time in my life. Waiting for a pc port that wouldn\'t happen is hard when every damn post, ad and YouTube video has references to the new Red Dead. Both the single player and multiplayer of RD1 has been fantastic so far. And yes, the multiplayer community is very active. \n\nFinishing up my initial play through of **West of Loathing**, one of the most fun games I have ever played. I took a break from it since the save file was on my travel laptop, but transferred it a few days ago. Highly recommended and probably the last turn based game I will finish in my life. ']"

Trying to get more sockets is aggravating, trying to get the right colours and the right links as well is a pain. You often can't use a better piece of equipment because the sockets are all wrong. It then once again runs into a problem for me where every build feels the same to me. I fire multishot projectiles which then chain to hit more enemies. I can pick between arrows, ice shards, fireballs, etc. but the projectiles all function identically. There are a handful of skills that are more unique, but that's the bulk of the selection.

Lands of Lore were from... westwood or sierra if I recall, and the voice acting was brilliant for that era, and the art was amazing, and the writers really knew how to drive the story forward.

Arcana was a slightly different beast, basically a rote standard and very generic game, but most of your party members were elemental spirits that you unlocked throughout the game.  It was made by HAL Laboratories, best known for the Kirby games, so you can understand want I mean when I say it had a unique charm.

Dungeon Flicker... not a bad game.  I can sit down and play it for a few minutes at a time and make some progress, there isn't really any story other than unlocking the next level.  Has a good core gameplay loop but has very little depth.

It's like being on a ride at an amusement park; it's fun, exciting, and a whole lot of fun, but you never feel like you are in any real danger, and you don't have to worry about making any bad choices, rather you are just worried whether or not you will see everything it has to offer. But the downside is that a JRPG can become tiresome, or in some cases you just kind of know where the game is going and loose interest. Also grinding can be a real horrible chore if there aren't any fun aspects to it, like varied combat or interesting loot. They are also relatively easy to just pick up and play.\n\nCRPGs focus much more on playing a version of yourself in a fantasy world, with a much greater emphasis on building and customizing your character. There tends to be less grinding in CRPGs, and you can really see your character develop into a specific class or character type before your eyes. The story is there and is often good (sometimes amazing) but you really have to keep on top of it (I have kept physical notes for CRPGs before) for it all make sense sometimes. CRPGs can be pretty unforgiving, though, and in a poorly designed character can prove for a seriously difficult gaming experience. And while JRPGs can be light-hearted to the point of being goofy sometimes, I find a lot of CRPGs take themselves a little too seriously.\n\nAt the end of the day they are both awesome, so play as many as you can."", ""I like jrpgs for their sappy/melodramatic/heartwarming moments that's pretty rare in wrpgs.\n\nI also prefer music in jrpgs which are more pronounced. They're usually catchy and help set the mood for the game. Wrpg music is usually atmospheric, being in the background, and complemens the mood of the game, instead of setting it.\n\nWrpg combat is usually better, with strategic positioning, uses of buff/debuffs/status effects. Though in the last decade there's a bunch of jrpgs that started to implement some of these aspects. (There's also some series where buffs/debuffs are important since the 90's but they're pretty rare, imo.)\n\nScripted enemy encounters in many wrpgs are more fun than random encounters a lot of jrpgs use.\n\nWorldbuilding and lore in wrpgs are mostly a lot better than in jrpgs.

', ""JRPG's tend to be more random, have a high degree of customization and fidelity for characters, and have much more grinding.\n\nCRPG's generally have more cohesive stories, clearer goals for character building, moral options, and recognizable plots and themes. \n\nAs far as strengths and weaknesses that's largely up to player preference.  \n\nFor me depends on my mood and what else I'm doing.

rpg_gamers,t3_9ysn2g,"Just completed Dragon Quest 6! Here's my mini review of it!Finally beaten Dragon Quest 6!

So what can I say about this game? I've played DQ7, 8 and 9 before this, so what I can say is that for the story it is definitely more engaging this time around. Instead of being a goody two shoes going to each town helping people, in this game... you do the same thing too except you do it for a purpose. Doing the mini stories in each town actually helps serving purpose to your adventure like you help this lady and you get a boat in return etc. However, the story falls a little flat when you reach the third act as you just randomly go around trying to look for something, but it will still serves a good purpose to your adventure. And expect to get lost a lot during this act.

Music. It's DQ! Of course the music is good. Do I have to say more?

The graphics this time around is amazing! The animation for some of the scenes are so lifelike that you can't help but wonder if this is a NDS or not! Very impressive for a NDS game.

And let us talk about gameplay. There's also a job system in this game and as usual, grinding is the meat of the game. You will grind alot. But the good thing is that you don't have to re-equip your characters each time you reclass. Heck, all your party members can equip some weapons on default that even if you reclass it won't affect your equipment (eg priest using a sword if you character originally can use a sword). Plus, any skills/spells you learn from your job is permanent! It's yours to keep! Definitely a great welcome when you compare to DQ9, which you don't get to keep your job skills after you reclass.

Anyways, my final verdict is a solid 8/10. A great game that exceeds my expectation. No serious complain except during the final act you get lost alot, and bosses becomes so tough that you may need to grind. Still it only took me around 30 hours to beat the main story.

Now then. Now that I've completed DQ6, I'm still deciding between Romancing Saga 2 and The Lost Child.

Now it may not be as impressive as an E3 award but one day (in a fantasy universe) games companies will be queuing up to win an award for our sub.

So, please nominate your RPG game of 2018. 

**To be eligible it should have been initially released between 1st November 2017 and 30th November 2018.**

Nominations need to have RPG elements, be on any console, mobile or PC platform and include a single player option. The moderators will judge if a game qualifies, where a game focuses on other elements such as FPS, sports, racing etc it will be excluded.

Once nominations are in we will split the games into sub-genres and the community can vote on their favourite games.

**Please post your nominations below and why you believe it should be our game of the year. One top-level comment per game please, do comment on already nominated games with any endorsements.** Nominations close on 30th November.

This is now closed and we will set up voting shortly. Thanks for all the nominations!

1. Dwindling physical media for consoles, or at least becoming more of an exclusive collector’s item. 

2. Japanese Developers leaning away from certain longtime console systems in favor of PCs. 

3. Preservation for the future, not just for myself, but for any friends or family that I may have down the line.

&amp;#x200B;

Hay All. So I've been taking some time to think about the impending status of games as a medium, and I'm looking for a bit of insight from some peers on what direction they thing the future of games will be taking. 

For one thing, physical media, I feel, is starting to spiral downwards, or become something more of a high-end collector's commodity for certain platforms. This shows not only in the fact that digital games tend to have better discounts on certain dates, but that retail prices for physical games from stores and especially scalpers seems to be escalating. 

Additionally, I've seen in some articles that a significant number of developers in Japan are at an even playing field in terms of developing for both consoles and computers, where in previous history they seemed to favor the former over the latter. It makes me think that if a country that leaned so strongly on console development for the longest time is starting to have developers switching gears, what that might say for their faith in the future of console gaming.  

I'm pondering on this not only for myself, but also for those that I may want to share my game catalog with in the future, such as family members or even kids that I may have later on in life. I'm the kind of person who does believe that games deserve to be preserved, and I'm wondering what type of platform might be the best to achieve that. Thanks.

The list of ""impossible to run on modern OSs"" classics is getting thinner every year. Old CD-ROMs made for DOS and even Windows 95 somehow can still work on modern PCs. It might take more work from the user, but you get to play the game. \n\nThe trend for PCs in recent years has been one of improving compatibility with old software (including games). This is going in the opposite direction of consoles, which have mostly abandoned real backwards compatibility in favor of subscription services that give you access to old games via download only as long as you are paying and the service is being supported.\n\nAnd then there is PC emulation of old consoles, which has never been better. We can argue the morality of it, but nobody can argue against it\'s efficiency. \n\nNintendo has been outed as selling ROMs that were downloaded from the web instead of actually extracting the games from the cartridge themselves and just recently it\'s been revealed that the PS1 Classic is using a freeware PC emulator which isn\'t even considered the most accurate one available.\n\nConsoles are great because you don\'t have to think about how it works, you just sit down and play, but with the console companies making their machines more complicated and less user friendly with each generation, it\'s hard not to recommend people at list try a little PC gaming to see if they like it better.', 'Well the Vita is almost dead, and planning on the next Xbox or Playstation to have backwards compatibility seems like a bad idea. I would not be surprised if backwards compatible never gets included, you had to get a special model ps4 for backwards compatible. ', 'PC, always PC.', ""PC does have the most longevity. It's not a question of who thinks what, it's a historical fact and there is no indication it should change any time soon."", ""PC.

The XBox is he best PC to console experience because it uses the same software and programming as their PC counterpart.  PlayStation not so much.\nSony is better on the business end of things and doing what gamers want. A machine and features to play games.  If you want an all in one entertainment machine, you get an Xbox.  \n\nDo You Think Has The Most Longevity?\nIn the end, I think that PC will win.  Esoecially with cloud based gaming, the PC is the best platform for gaming.  Don't get me wrong, I broke my gaming teeth with an Atari and NES and will always play consoles.  The PC is the most versitle system out there because they can be upgraded beyond just changing out the hard drive.\n\n"", 'You know, a few years ago I would have said PS4, but since then gaming companies have got their crap together and gone ahead and started porting most of their games to PC.  \n\nI mean just look at that NIS sale presently.

There are optional super bosses and secret tough areas. You can use your magical abilities to affect the actual world. For example you could use growth to make a vine grow up a cliff that you then climb up. You can use telekinesis to pick up a boulder and move it somewhere else, or you can use a spell that makes a miniature rain storm(douse) to create a puddle, and then use freeze to turn that puddle into a pillar of ice which you use to jump from one ledge to the ice pillar then to the other ledge etc. There are a lot of puzzles and mysteries throughout the game as well.

Have you tried Gothic, for example?\n\nJRPGs are a different type of game, going into them expecting to play a CRPG is setting yourself up for disappointment. The best JRPGs are mainly linear games with brief instances of mostly faux openness. They are good for different reasons.', 'Both Saga Frontier and Legend of Mana are nonlinear JRPG classics that came out in the late 90\'s when the CRPG\'s were in their prime, both are for the PS1.  Legend of Mana story lines are determined completely by which artifact you decide to use to create the with no set path and your main character is a blank slate to build with chosen weapons armor, magic, techniques, etc. It is a very open adventure.

This one is full on Turn Based combat like you are used to seeing in old school games. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, the things you have to watch out for that might detract a freeroaming CRPG gamer is that although these are very free and nonlinear for JRPG\'s, you are not going to be able to kill civilian NPC\'s in full blown evil glory as a lot of WRPG\'s allow. It is going to be more like Mass Effect than Fallout in that regard. Likewise, the aesthetic of both of these games is far more ""cartoony"", Legend of Mana has a fairy talish Story book style while Saga Frontier can get pretty anime.

rpg_gamers,t3_9xibq3,"JRPGS with intuitive progression systems and fun grinding. I liked ff12 ZA, Witcher 3 and dragon age. playstyle driven skill trees but I dont mind if characters have fixed progression and I choose my team. 
Been wanting to play:
ff6-9 
chrono trigger
final fantasy tactics.

I have a little rant below.

 I started ffx and can't finish it because the sphere grid system intimidates me from immersing myself in the characters and their journey.

The progress system for stats and abilities has you grind for sphere levels that can only be spent in the skill tree if you have the right spheres for each stat group.  Different monsters drop different spheres.

This took the standard: level up, increase stats (learn abilities)/(assign skill points) and complicates it to increase playtime.

It give an illusion of stuff to do when you're grinding copies of a monster. Was the industry was smaller and people had less money and needed more playtime out of one game? Did hardware  storage limit or genre conventions creativity in gameplay?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9xibq3/jrpgs_with_intuitive_progression_systems_and_fun/,"['I\'m surprised by your experience with FFX. I\'m not very tolerant to grinding but I\'ve found FFX to be an interesting one. Even when the battle is trivial you have to do some mental excercise: need to rotate the team so that everyone gets XP, need to do overkills to get bonuses, sometimes need to use capture weapons to progress monster arena quest. Felt relatively creative. I still didn\'t venture far into postgame but it was enjoyable.\n\nAnyway JRPGs in general are not that good about it. It\'s as if they foresaw all those online/mobile games: you have very limited control over progression, probably so that you can\'t screw it up. Later you have more control and by that time you\'re supposed to make informed decisions.\n\nOne good exception is Disgaea series. You can jump straight into the 5th one, it was released on PC and Switch recently and there\'s PS4 version. The progression itself looks linear but it\'s more like classic blobbers that JRPGs are based on: you have to switch character classes to adjust their stats. You can also influence characters by teaching them passive and active abilities, and then you can upgrade said abilities by use or by spending ""mana"" (basically second type of XP) to make them stronger or covering bigger area. It has insane progression curve, e.g. you may have a character start with ~10 HP and end the game with millions, same for other stats. The only problem is that story is deliberately silly and over the top, switching from drama about stolen curry to drama about murdered parents to comedy about torturing people.', 'Have you considered Octopath Traveler? It has fixed character classes that can be expanded by accepting other Jobs without getting too complicated. Also, grinding there is pretty fun because you really can experience the progress on every level you reach.', 'I will start with this: FFVI and IX are probably more your style. Feel free to stop reading here. You will probably love IX.\n\nWith that out of the way, I would like to offer a few counter points:\n\nIf you play FFX straight through, you will probably never notice a lack of the correct spheres. That only comes up in the postgame / when you\'re trying to 100% complete the game. You don\'t have to grind the same monster at all.\n\nFFX is one of my favorite games, and my second favorite FF game. I have never seen the postgame, not once. I have no idea what the extra bosses are, I have no idea what you have to go through to get all of the final limit breaks and weapons. I\'ve never done a minigame in FFX.\n\nIt does have all this stuff, and that does pad the playtime for the type of person who likes to do all of that content. But I don\'t. If you follow the progression of the story, it actually has *less* grinding than many games in the genre, almost all of them. It has quick, just above braindead mob fights (they teach you the mechanics) and then very strategic boss fights all the way through the game. And you get to make some choices in your progression along the way (especially in the International/HD version.)\n\nHowever, I want to say it will be hard for you to find exactly what you are looking for. In the JRPG genre, players who like grinding *also* like unique and expressive progression systems. Games with fun grinding are fun *because* they have lots of stuff to do that aren\'t just ""spend points.""  They are rarely fun because the battles themselves are fun: even the most fun system gets boring if you have to do it over and over again.\n\nTo end, I will say that it is very surprising for me to hear that FFX\'s issues, to you, stem from technological limitations and from a smaller industry. To me, FFX\'s release marked a period where having *too good* technology led to games having worse mechanics because everything was spent on graphics and voice acting. Restrictions *breed* creativity. FFX came out at a time when Square-Enix was on top of the world and the JRPG genre wasn\'t as niche as it is now. For me, FFX marked the death of the genre that I so loved. (Spoilers: I got better. I like it now!)\n\nI hope you got at least something interesting out of my very opinionated rant. I think that you would like FFX if you approached it a little differently.']"

rpg_gamers,t3_9xbzlw,"Your thoughts on charm/mind control in RPGs?I'm conflicted about charm skills since on one hand, it presents players with an interesting dilemma on how to deal with charmed party members: do they attack them and try to down them for the fight to mitigate the extra damage source, or do they wait it out/try to cure the character?

On the other hand though, it takes away control from the player and is sometimes needlessly frustrating when there aren't a lot of skills/stats to prevent charm. It could come off as unfair and frustrating.

I can see where they’re coming from because it isn’t very fun to do nothing on your turn and/or attack your friends. \n\nHowever, it’s also true that these effects have a tactical and thematic place in most games. They introduce new tactics and ways to adapt in the middle of a fight. They’res a clear balance to it in most cases, like breaking the caster\'s concentration, killing them, spending an action to ""snap your ally out of it"", etc. Maybe you save your big hitting abilities for the caster to break their concentration, and suddenly it’s not such a fun-killer. In my experience most people who complain about things like this aren’t very skilled players and don’t really know how the balance of the game works.\n\nHonestly, playing a caster or fighting against one gets very boring without CC abilities that stop enemies from doing things.

rpg_gamers,t3_9x8ajz,"Do you like indies better on Steam on Mac or PS4 (and Vita)?Hey Guys. While I’m taking some time to reflect on my gaming purchases, I’m finding myself torn between which platform I prefer to play Indie titles for: Playstation or Macbook. So far I’ve built up a significant number of digital only titles for my PS4 which in hindsight I could easily have gotten for Steam, but at the time I was so enticed by having them for console that I felt I had to get them. Either that, or I only owned a Mac at the time and couldn’t access them unless it was through the PS Store. Some of the titles include: 

Dead Cells

Tooth and Tail 

Rain World

Battle Chasers: Nightwar

Salt and Sanctuary

Skullgirls

Tales from the Borderlands

The Sexy Brutale

Dust: An Elysian Tail

Darkest Dungeon

Shovel Knight

Indivisible

As it stands, I still have a great number of games that I would want to get in the future whenever they go on sale for either platform, and this is where my conflict comes in to play. While I do love the PS4, I worry that building up a large digital catalog that will only play on that system would be detrimental to preserving my purchases. On the other hand, I mainly use my Macbook for my work as an artist, and I also realize that it doesn’t have the strongest capabilities when it comes to running and especially storing games. 

Some games that I am considering for either of these platforms include the following titles: 

Battle Chef Brigade

Death’s Gambit

Hollow Knight

A Hat in Time

Celeste

Owlboy

Songbringer

Minit

Va-11 Hall-A

Eitr

Additionally, I also listed a few games that I’m strongly considering getting on PS4 because of the cross buy option with the Vita, which I absolutely adore. Some of these titles include the following: 

FEZ

Iconoclasts

Axiom Verge

Timespinner

The Count Lucanor

Risk of Rain

Slain: Back From Hell

Super Time Force Ultra

Crypt of the NecroDancer

Cursed Castila

Velocity 2X

Children of Morta

Battle Princess Madelyn

YIIK: A Postmodern RPG

So I guess what I’m really wondering is if you guys have a preference for what platform to get each of these games for, if there are some games you think would be worth eliminating from this list, or even which platform you think would be worth maintaining my game catalog for altogether. Any input you guys have on the matter would be most appreciated.

rpg_gamers,t3_9x0vfp,"What are the chances that Microsoft tries merging InXile and Obsidian?So as we all probably know by now Microsoft is buying InXile and Obsidian, and while lots of questions of how much autonomy they will maintain and worries about corporate meddling, my big question, given how similar the types of games these two produce (even so far as using the same engine on one of them) is the likelihood that Microsoft opts to merge both studios into one. After all I am sure Microsoft views this as their new CRPG division, and with the likelihood of them pumping more money into those studios, and the need to hire more talent as the projects increase in scale, wouldn't the obvious answer be to combine the two?

Would the Soulsborne series be more accessible (and less frustrating) if it had an easy mode?

I think the existence of difficulty options is a big indicator of a developer's design philosophy and target audience. Additionally, it works well for some RPGs (namely RPGs based primarily on stats and progression) rather than others (action-oriented, skill based).

What do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9x0oig/difficulty_settings_or_singular_hard_as_hell_mode/,"['If you are going with a single difficulty then it matters what the game actually is when making that decision. A story based game should be easy enough for the most casual of gamers to complete, which might make some of the big boss fights feel less epic to skilful players.

By and large, I want my friends to enjoy games I enjoy. I do think that developers should (some already do) point out which difficulty the game is balanced around, and that difficulty does not need to be ""normal"". For example a Dark Souls with an easy mode should be balanced around it\'s most difficult (Or maybe second most difficult) setting.\n\nI would also argue that it isn\'t impossible to change ai with difficulty, especially if you limit it to the most important encounters in the game. Difficulty settings do not have to be as artificial as hit points and damage bonuses.', 'As i stated on a thread not to long ago.\n\nI think a single difficulty is most beneficial because that way the developers can balance everything thoroughly instead of 4 different times.

Real PVP in a way. In that game, economy and industry is as much important, if not more in some ways, than fights/battles, as if there weren't people mining asteroids, if there weren't people producing ammos, modules and ships, if there weren't people hauling ressources and goods around, if there weren't people managing player's citadels, corporations, alliances and coalitions, caring about the logistic, or ellaborating strategies and battle plans, the wars and battles between players couldn't exist, as they would have no ships and no ressources to actually wage them.

rpg_gamers,t3_9wuj09,"HELP NEEDED!!! - Finding the most common archetypes and how to allocate them in my JRPG video gameHi there, RPG lovers. I need a bit of your help. I'm currently developing with other guys a ""classical"" JRPG game (“classical” in the sense that it uses turn-based battles, is very story-driven and has a fantasy setting).

&amp;#x200B;

What I basically need, is to find some classes or archetypes commonly found in RPG's and that are easily distinguishable.

&amp;#x200B;

To give you some context, each unit can learn any skill from the 3 main disciplines:

&amp;#x200B;

Combat, which would be the basic archetype of a Knight, your typical straight forward warrior that is all about dealing damage serving as main attackers or defenders.

&amp;#x200B;

Reconnaissance (Recon), which would be the basic archetype of a Thief or an Archer. They would mostly use a variety of skills that allows them to ""attack from the back"", or disrupt the enemies, and are ""weaker"" in sheer strength than the Combat specialists.

&amp;#x200B;

Support, which would be the basic archetype of a generic Mage who specialize in supportive magic. They mostly lack offensive skills but specialize in status buffs and debuffs.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the characters can learn any of 6 elements in the game, which are: Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Light and Darkness. When combined you get an ""archetype"". However I'm at a loss at some of them, and I would need some help to define them. Here are the archetypes I've allocated so far:

&amp;#x200B;

Combat + Fire = Berserk (breaks equipment)

&amp;#x200B;

Combat + Water = Ninja (can hide, neutralize opponents and infiltrate)

&amp;#x200B;

Combat + Air = Samurai (uses long distance attacks with swords)

&amp;#x200B;

Combat + Earth = Paladin (highest defense)

&amp;#x200B;

Combat + Light = Monk (highest HP and sheer spiritual power)

&amp;#x200B;

Combat + Darkness = Dark Knight (leeches its enemies' life and intimidates)

&amp;#x200B;

Recon + Fire = ???

As you van see, I'm at complete loss on Recon + Fire. I can't come up with a typical archetype of a ""not so direct fighter"" mixed with the aggresive nature of Fire.

&amp;#x200B;

Recon + Water = Thief (quick for looting)

&amp;#x200B;

Recon + Air = Archer (best distance fighter)

&amp;#x200B;

Recon + Earth = Hunter (best trap user, not necessarily a distance fighter)

&amp;#x200B;

Recon + Light = ?

Perhaps a Bard/Dancer? But I feel that would be too ""supporty"" and wouldn't quite fit on the ""not too direct into combat but isn't a mage either"" style.

&amp;#x200B;

Recon + Darkness = Assassin (hiding, similar to Ninja but more inclined for one hit kills)

			

Support + Fire = Pyromancer?

As for the Pyromancer, while I like it, it clearly doesn't fit in the whole theme of “support” as the other archetypes, since it is all about explosions and setting everything on fire, and I don’t think that placing that archetype on the Recon side would make sense since all the Recon types are in a sense “less direct fighters” with little to no association with the “mage” type, although that's just me, and maybe I could just move it into the Recon Spectrum and get done with it, but then which archetype would fit into the Support + Fire? Witch/Shaman, maybe? And what style of play would it have?

&amp;#x200B;

Support + Water = Illusionist (the name is self explanatory)

&amp;#x200B;

Support	+ Air = Aeromancer / Time Mage (Is not a ""time mage"" per se, but love the tag)

&amp;#x200B;

Support	+ Earth = Geomancer (uses golems and the environment)

&amp;#x200B;

Support	+ Light = Priest (your archetypical healer)

&amp;#x200B;

Support	+ Darkness = Necromancer (your archetypical zombie master)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Any help is appreciated! Also, if you're interested in my game, you can follow me at: [https://www.facebook.com/HeartsOfMana/](https://www.facebook.com/HeartsOfMana/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9wuj09/help_needed_finding_the_most_common_archetypes/,"['I would think that the recon-fire would be fine as a pyromancer, but maybe rather than big explosions it would be more about setting things on fire and letting them wither away. \n\nBasically the damage over time archetype. I suppose if you wanted it to keep more in the recon theme you could do something like an archer/crossbowman that imbues their arrows/bolts with fire. I think straight up poison would make more sense but that\'s not generally a ""fire"" thing. \n\nAs for the support-fire, I\'m not exactly sure what combat roles Aero/Illusionist would take. I imagine Aero as a buffer, speeding up the party and whatnot, dropping lightning bolts occasionally. Illusionist more of a debuffer distracting enemies and causing them to miss and such. So I imagine a fire support to be more of someone who would buff physical power, possibly imbuing weapons (flaming swords, lol) and able to cauterize wounds if need be. \n\nAs for recon-light, I\'d say probably like a monster/demon/vampire/witch (etc) hunter. The guy who has his crossbow/gun loaded with silver ammunition, a stake, holy water, basically whatever tools he needs to hunt the evil he\'s after. So basically someone who exploits weaknesses but doesn\'t necessarily have the raw power when he\'s not doing that. ', ""What's your setting's tech level? I'm thinking the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecon + Fire = Gunner or Outlaw. Mid-range wide AoE dual guns and grenades.\n\nSupport + Fire = Engineer or Tinkerer. Mechanized summons and flamethrowers and debuff/control gadgets.\n\nRecon + Light = Inquisitor or Agent with a chuuni flavor, uses very specialized magic to augment their trickery. Like Fate's Kiritsugu, FGO's Mysterious Heroine X or Neptunia's IF.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do think a lot of this is subjective though. Like personally, Ninja would definitely be the Recon counterpart to Samurai as they're historically not direct combatants. I also feel like Paladin should be Light since it's the Combat counterpart to Priest, while Monk should be Water (think Bruce Lee's 'be like water' quote). This system as you probably notice is also a little restrictive in that some classic classes like Black Mage and Red Mage would use multiple elements and occupy neither a recon nor support nor combat role, therefore won't fit. Concepts like time magic, gravity magic are also difficult to fit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis kind of system is good for mobile gacha games, because the developers are big studios with lots of resources for artwork and animations, and it encourages players to build multiple parties around an element. For an indie JRPG though, 4 x 6 = 24 classes is going to be a nightmare to build and balance. Even the original FF Tactics only had 19 classes. Pillars of Eternity has 11. Conversely, games with class overload like Neverwinter Nights at 22 classes have some very weak classes that are noob traps and some classes have skills that don't work right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy suggestion is to think of around 3 to 4 classes you'll be the most passionate about designing and building and how they'd fit together in a party - no need to worry about role, archetype or element at this stage. Then think of 2 sample encounters they'll be fighting and how the party would handle the encounter:\n\n* Would they complement each other nicely in different roles? In which case, what would someone replacing a character in that role while having different gameplay look like?\n* Would there be some overlap which leaves a gap, if so, what would that gap be and what kind of class would fill it?\n\nBased on that, expand the list of 3-4 to 9-12, categorize accordingly after you're done and roll with that while keeping the base system open enough for an expansion or Enhanced Edition. Then make sure each class is well designed and fun to play."", 'Recon + Fire could be a kind of Alchemist, either throwing bombs or putting them on arrows and stuff.

rpg_gamers,t3_9wud1f,"RPG game recommendationHello. I am pretty new to this genre. Recently I had a chance to play 4 rpg titles, and based on that I developed some understanding about what I am looking for in a game. I would also rate myself as a casual player so keep that in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my requirements:

\- Don't really care about graphics. Old or new games, anything goes.

\- Has to be on PC.

\- Not looking for a game with a lot of grinding. I tried to get into Diablo 1, and I was extremely dissapointed. Going back a forth into the same dungeon over and over is just unexceptable for me.

\- Looking for a game that is story driven rather than a game where it's all about fighting monsters.

\- No party/companion game. Unless the mechanics are very simplistic like for example in Chrono Trigger, I would rather stay away. I am not into heavy multitasking and managing a lot of characters gives me a headache.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the games I played:

\- Diablo 1 - Too much fighting. Not enough story

\- Chrono Trigger - Good and I also completed the game. Although, I am not really looking for another clone of this kind of game.

\- Baldurs Gate 1 - Party...

\- Golden Land -  I don't expect you to know it. It's a game from Russian studio and it's not even translated to english.  I liked it though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9wud1f/rpg_game_recommendation/,"[""This all Depends on if you wanna go as ZigZach said Emulation?

From this you want more story which I too like, Grinding is such a pain... Some of the best Rpgs with Story are I think mainly considered Jrpgs Chrono trigger and such Final Fantasy 2 and 3 for the Snes if you like older stuff.

rpg_gamers,t3_9wsot7,"I feel like Two Worlds and its sequel dont get enough love.Now they are not the best RPGs around but they are far from the worse. On a real scale of 1-10 where 5 is actually decent vs the gamespot/ign scale of 1-10 where 8 wasn't paid enough for a review and thus crap, I would give the TW1 a 7.5 on the real scale. Id bump it up to an 8.5 if the story and the performance were any better. The first one is a cheap buy having being released 11 years ago. Its going to scratch the itch for wanting a quick killing RPG while the second one came out 8 years ago yesterday and received a DLC update last year and theres a second one supposedly on its way. 

Im going to focus on TW1 right now because that is what I am currently playing. 

TW1:Epic Edition can be picked up on GOG or Steam for $10. Recently it was on sale on GOG for $1.00. I know how with game sales go you'll buy a game at that cheap because ""if it sucks its only a buck"" and your backlog gets filled, eventually play it, and see that it sucks. Not so with TW1. Its worth the $10 price tag IMO. In my first run through I didnt do anywhere near the exploration Im doing in my current playthrough and I managed to get 24 hours out of it.  Its a good size open world that allows you to either find horses and take them from bandits/enemies or do quests to buy your own. The other method to get around involves teleport stones/gates. When you unlock one you can travel to it freely from another one. Theres even a quest later on to get a teleport gate stone that can be dropped anywhere to teleport. In a dungeon and need to sell loot? Drop the stone, port to a nearby city, sell, go back to the pad, port back, pick up the gate stone. Horses can be teleported but it takes some effort to do so. I have skipped horses in general because Im getting on and off them so much to go out of my way to kill everything to level. Theres nice little nooks and crannies to explore. The world map presents you with all of the roads you can run across even showing you the main road that if followed will take you straight through to the main quests and big cities. You could also branch off on the smaller paths for things to kill.


Combat wise you are not locked into the standard warrior role to play through the whole game though at least at the start, warrior is the easiest option. You do start with a bow, a sword, the fireball spell, and a heal spell. Your mana regenerates slowly at first and you cant run and aim with a bow. Every level up you get 5 stat points and 1 skill point though you gain other skill points while leveling. Theres skills to increase physical damage with melee weapons, faster draw time with bows, better lockpicking, stealth, defensive fighting for taking less damage while dealing less or berserking to deal more damage while taking more. Skills max out at 10 points. You start with several skills that you can put points into right away. Others like alchemy you need to find a trainer and buy the first point into it. Alchemy is especially handy in the game.

With alchemy you can create several items. Temporary boosts, permanent boosts, and damage gems. Temporary boosts might be something like 50 strength for 5 minutes. I skip those because I already have more than enough strength and as long as your smart with dodging you can whittle just about anything down. Permanent potions can increase resistances and stats. While at the start of the game you'll need mostly strength to wield melee weapons, some of the later polearms and spears require dex. I was using a weapon with a max of 600 or so damage with pure strength when I found one that did a minimum of 900 but I needed some dex. I had enough perma stat items that after using them I only had to put 2 levels into dex and I was killing everything fast. I have enough resistance from mixing items that I can take lightning bolts and poison damage for days and shrug them off. The damage gems add a % of weapon damage back to the weapon in elemental damage. If a weapon does 1000 damage and you put a 10% fire gem in it you will now do 1000 physical damage and 100 fire damage which is great for fighting ghosts. I have enough of those gems and I dont switch weapons often enough that I try and keep the damage around 100-200 elemental damage for the ghost creatures that spawn from the dead. Most of the ingredients youll run across will be plants that will be for the temporary boosts. In dungeons you might find minerals that increase resistances. Strong enemies will drop most of your perma boost ingredients. It is more then worth it to drop the 10k cost to purchase the first rank in alchemy as every other rank can be leveled through skill points.

Back to melee for a moment - Theres three types of damage. Slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. The first two seem like they can be blocked but bludgeoning seems like it can knock through shields and parries though I have not found anything to confirm it. Different weapons have different attack styles. Swords are a simple slash. A two handed heavy mace will do several attacks straight in front of the character knocking out whatever's in your path. A spear at higher levels will thrust towards the first enemy in front of you but then spin around in a circle and attack everything. 

For magic you dont learn spells so much as you find spell cards and put skill points into their domain to use higher ranks. With the spell cards you stack them together to make stronger spells. There are also spell support cards that increase damage, decrease mana cost, increase summoning effectiveness, and one other I cant remember off the top of my head. The basic heal spell takes several casts to heal you at level 1. With 2 heal cards stacked on top of each other, 1 heal boost, and 2 reduced casting cost cards I heal myself for 600 health at the cost of about 45 mana. As I am not a mage that small cost goes a long way. If I play through the game a third time I will work on going through all mage.

All armor can be equipped provided you meet the right stats. There seems to be 3 types. Mage, light, and heavy armor. Mage armor is the standard robes that typically offers bonus to mana and caster stats while offering almost no protection. Light gives you a decent amount of armor and lets you swim and equip any weapon. Heavy armor makes you a tank but you can't swim in it or use a bow. Speaking of equipping, you get 3 weapon slots. With the R key you can swap back and forth between the slots to either switch melee weapons for damage types or switch combat styles from melee to range to mage at a whim. Since you can't run while aiming its somewhat useful to pull with a bow to get a few shots in early game. 

Weapons and armor work similar to the spell system. If you find the same item, drop it over the one you currently have and it will meld them together. The current spear I have I bought from a vendor for 10k when it did a max of 1500 damage. Later I killed an enemy and found the same spear but with lower stats. I dragged it over mine to meld it and my max damage went up to 2100. This can be helpful early game if the first two goblins you run into in the cave happen to spawn with at least one sword that matches your starting sword. Oh yes. Loot is random. I played this on the PC and the 360 and noticed right away that the goblins and the chest near them almost always spawn with something different. Back to melding/upgrading. I found a piece of armor that had 600ish for protection against the 3 damage types. I have found enough similar types that Im now close to 1000 protection against those. 


**edit**

One thing I forgot to add - The bandits.

At first the bandits will attack you outright to kill you. Then they will tell you to put your weapon away and talk to you. They will surround you and ask for money. You can try to tell them no or give it to them. Eventually after killing enough of them, when you tell them no they ""didn't realize it was you"" and say ""it was a misunderstanding"" before running off. Of course you could always kill them rather then letting them run off and thats when they all attack you. Or just run in there without giving them a chance to talk. Its a nice little touch on a game. Theres more factions and all have reputation. Word of your deeds gets around.

**Main/side quest spoilers in the next paragraph**

So those all sound pretty decent. The part where the game lacks is in terms of performance and story. Theres villages scattered across the land. Most of them have 2-4. They can range from ""Please kill the monsters in this cave"" to ""I need you to tell X to sod off"" and X willing to sod off only after you do a quest for him but you have to do a quest before that. Basicly small quest chains. Last night I found a small side village. One gave me a quest to kill orcs, one to kill bandits, and another to kill an ogre and then clear a graveyard. Another quest I did yesterday was a small social one to get a guy married. Other quests are not so straight forward. In a city I was given a task by a guard to clear the road of bandits so he can get more moonshine and talk to his supplier. His supplier in another part of the map says theres bandits in a cave that attack him on the road and they need to be dealt with. When you go to the bandits cave its full of skeletons. After dealing with them and talking to him he says they are his security system and a necromancer must have messed up the spell. He sends you off even farther to find the necromancer who asks for some quest items before he can get rid of the skeletons. I am on the second part of the quest now. While the items he needs are not hard to find, they are limited quantities that only spawn in certain areas. Then, maybe Ill get the bandit to leave, run back to the moonshiner, and get the drinks to give to the guard. Ive done more side stories then main stories at this point. Im level 40 and I have only done 3 story quests at this point and those have been ""meet here, talk to X""

**End main/side quest spoilers**

Performance wise it runs awful on the 360. Its an open world that needs to load new areas occasionally (see frequently) and that drops the framerate to a stand still for a few seconds (at least from what I can recall when I tried it on 360 about 5 years ago). Meanwhile my PC is 4 years old with 32 GBs of ram, quad core 4.0ghz CPU, and a titan X video card. I play overwatch, skyrim, and fallout 4 on there without any performance issues except for those that are poorly optimized for said games. Yet with my build I experience rare stops and spudders. Sometimes while it autosaves, other times what seems to be random. I actually found part of the map with a stitch seam running through it clear as day. Running over the stitch caused the character to stop for just a moment and then keep running. Still. I played it for 5+ hours without restarting on Sunday or Saturday so there is no memory leak that I could see. The GOG version seems to work better then the steam version on windows 10. Because of my computer specs I have everything on high yet there are times enemies will load in around me. I can see a circle around my character. Outside of the circle is barren empty ground. Moving in any direction populates that area with grass when it enters the circle. Some areas also have an odd glow to them thats more annoying than what impacts performance.

Despite the performance flaws and the low effort story (thus far) its a good game and worth spending some time on it.

Similar games to it include the Gothic series, Risen series, Dungeon Siege 3 (at least according to google), Divinity II, Ravens Cry, KnightShift, Kingdoms  of Amular: Reckoning, and Venetica. I have played a few of those and I think Two Worlds 1 is smack dab in the middle of those in terms of game mechanics, story, and player friendlyness.

The Gothic series is known to be pretty rough. 1 and 2 have not aged well 3 requires that you level up to get skill points and then spend money to spend skill points at trainers. This can be tedious and I quit the game early on because of it though I might try it again after my 2nd TW2 playthrough (after the last DLC comes out). Gothic 4 was horrible and should have been its own series. Its not open world and it has a bad teleport system from pad 1 to pad 2 but not bad 2 to pad 3. If you wanted to go to pad 4 from pad 1 you could port from pad 1 to pad 2 then walk to pad 3 and port down to pad 4. The enemies do not respawn and the game world is linear. Once quests are done in that area theres no reason to go back except maybe a special vendor item or in the rare case a quest back tracks. Its akin to WoW in that there are quest hubs in each zone. Grab all the quest, go clear them, move onto the next zone. If I had to recommend  Gothic 4 or TW1 it would be TW1 hands down.

The Risen series was (from what I read) an attempt to recreate the Gothic series while still being somewhat more accessible to new players. There is no teleport system in the first game. Your stuck on an island and have to walk all the damn time. The enemies and drops never respawn so in theory there is a level cap. Like Gothic you also need to spend money to improve your skills. Combat requires learning to dodge and parry or you will die. In theory you could beat the game with the weapon you start with. I have yet to play 2 and 3 for more then 10 minutes but I do hope to give them some time next year (big backlog... of rpgs...). I would still recommend the first one if you can ""get"" the mechanics as it was fun. TW1 is more forgiving.

Dungeon Siege 3 is more of a twin stick game that is a bad entry in the Dungeon Siege series only in terms of a weak connection and complete overhaul of the previous systems. If it had its own series it would have done better. 

I haven't gotten far in Divinity 2. Its more dialog heavy then TW1 is and the little bit I did play was not open world.

Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning - I haven't played this in 4+ years but it felt like a linear game with big areas yet it was still enjoyable with the freedom it gave you on customizing skills. Its filled with more lore and backstory outside of quests. 

Venetica - I bought it on 360 and didnt like it but I want to buy it on PC during a sale to see if its any better. 


Im not sorry for the long writeup. TW1 is a decent to good game and Ill do a write up for TW2 when I get to playing it again. They have been called the ""poor mans oblivion before"" by a few people. Unfortunately it came out at the end of 2007 which saw a mix of either critically acclaimed RPGs or critically scorned RPGs such as The Witcher, Final Fantasy IV for DS, Lord of the Rings Online, Oblivion:Shivering Isles, Final Fantasy Tactics War of the Lion (psp remake/update of ps1 tactics), Hellgate London (bad), Silverfall (worse), Loki: Heroes of Mythology (somehow worse then the last two combined), Lost Odyssey, Bioshock, Blue Dragon, Dirge of Cerberus, Monster Hunter 2, Pokemon Diamon/Pearl, Wild Arms 5, Avancast Rise of the Mage, Crisis Core:FF7, Oblivion (ps3 and game of the year), the numerous other Final Fantasy re-releases on several different systems, Mass Effect, NWN2:mask of the betrayer,  and many other RPGs that I didnt list because they are more of ""niche"" then well known.

rpg_gamers,t3_9wmj7a,"A new way to rank RPGs, what do you guys think?I'm sure everyone has seen the top 50/100 lists that various sites have put out, and it always becomes an argument about the exact spot a game is placed, which I think is different for everyone. I think having a tier list (like fighting games) is a better way to rank RPGs, we may not agree that Chrono Trigger is the #1 rpg of all time, but I think we can all agree it's S tier.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is how I see the tier lists:

S tier - Ultra classics, any of these would be a easy contender for game of the year in the  year they were released and still great to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

A Tier - Great RPGs almost to the level of instant classics like the S tier games, it's either slightly flawed or just doesn't have the same combination of qualities that make it into S Tier

&amp;#x200B;

B Tier - Really great, but the flaws is big enough that it detracts from the overall game

&amp;#x200B;

C Tier - Interesting games that have pretty big issues, still worthwhile to play as it tries to do something new/interesting but does fall short

&amp;#x200B;

D Tier - Trash game

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the games I've played and finished that I consider S tier:

**S tier**

Chrono Trigger

Persona 4 Golden

Baldure's Gate 1,2,exp

Mass Effect 1,2,3

The Witcher 3

Final Fantasy 6

rpg_gamers,t3_9w6yk2,"Hold My Ale - I'm creating a RPG where you have to think before attack. What do you think of my ideas? 

Hi guys!!

I decided to create n RPG with my own vision because i was tired of brainless RPGs.

I already have some work done:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2gGHR9YRRM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2gGHR9YRRM)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCDbQWLckkU&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCDbQWLckkU&amp;t=0s)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEOrDqfESz0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEOrDqfESz0)

I'm doing this alone for now and the progression it's a bit slow but i will manage.

At this point i have 3 different adventurers (Warrior, Ranger and Mage) that i can control at a time.

My next step will be give them AI so they can do several actions for themselves when the player it's not in control.

After  that i will implement the Darwin System :) it's a system where you can  setup a default behavior for each adventurer when you aren't in control.

For example if you want that the mage heal your party members you only need to setup that behavior in this system.

Basically  you give them orders to execute with a priority but there is a catch,  since each adventurer has his own personality traits there is a  probability that they will ignore the Darwin System orders :)

By  the way in this game you need to do some crafting and farming because  you will need to create provisions, armors, weapons, portions etc... for  your adventurers.

If you send your  adventurers to a dungeon in the mountains you will have to craft them  warm cloths and if you journey will take 3 days you will need to provide  enough food for the journey or maybe the adventurers won't arrive to  the destination.

Another thing that will  be clever it will be to send a scout or a scholar if you already hired  one, to tell you what kind of monsters there is in the dungeon, their  average size, their magical traits etc...

That  way you can create a crafting strategy, for example if the dungeon only  has small monsters maybe you will need to invest your few materials in  create better armor for the waist down. If your scout eared rumors about  a decease in some villages in the path of the dungeon, maybe you will  need to create some medicine for your adventurers.

Another  thing that i believe that will be important in this game is that a  player can attack specific parts of the body of the enemy without stop  the combat. That will be useful if you are fighting an enemy that you  found out with the scholar that it's not strong or very resistant but it  deals great damage. Maybe it's because he has a very powerful weapon in  his right hand.

If it's that the case  you only need to equip one adventurer with a weapon that has 4 disarm  right perfect jewels, those jewels (if they are perfectly crafted) have  20% chance each to disarm the enemy right hand, in this case 80% of  probability.

If you are fighting very  fast enemies maybe you need to equip a weapon with slow down effect  jewels that targets the enemies legs.

It's not a brainless combat you will need a lot of strategy to win this game.

I  will also want that the players take advantage of the surroundings to  their advantage. You can use a narrow dungeon corridor to place some  traps with some veal meat in the center to attract the 20 enemies in the  other room since your scholar knows that their species love veal meat  and kill them one by one with your warrior and the rogues traps.

Another  think that i believe that will be interesting it will be having a  puzzle room in the dungeon that you can only start solving with the help  of the scholar because he is the only one that can read other  languages. he will be also able to play music that gives some obnoxious  effects to your enemies. I'm thinking that players will have to follow  some music notes with keyboard keystrokes to be successful.

These are only a few ideas but i have a lot more.

Story:

Hold My Ale it's a single player farming, management and RPG game with some elements of Darkest Dungeons.

It's about a boy which is family was killed by dungeon creatures that raid his village.

He is a coward with no fighting skills but he wants to revenge his family, all he have its a tiny house with some farming land.

He  decides to hire some adventurers to do his dirty work earning fame and  money every time his adventurers clear a dungeon with his equipment and  provisions.

But it's not easy to achieve all this since each adventurer has his temperament.

More  fame he earns better adventurers are available to hire. He has to farm,  mine, cook... to get the provisions for his companions in this  adventure.

I hope you like it and if possible give me some of your ideas to improve this game :p

In reality they sold about 110k copies that is probably not even cover development costs.\n\nWell at least i\'m sure that Fallout 76 won\'t fail in sales.

Both studios were producing very average-quality games for a long time, and it's a wonder they kept their independence for this long. However, I don't see Microsoft doing much to improve the quality of releases, beyond maybe purely technical side of things, with more money and time for QA (which is a bonus, but not a deciding factor). In an inertial scenario, I expect inXile to release one or two mediocre titles under MS, then folding, or maybe switching to mobile due to management pressure. However, the press release also mentions that the newly acquired studios might be given IP's belonging to MS to develop new games for. This could be somewhat interesting: what does MS own that could benefit from Brian Fargo's treatment? [The list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Studios#Owned_franchises_and_properties) is not particularly promising. Microsoft owns Shadowrun and BattleTech, but both recently received titles from HareBrained, and I don't imagine MS putting up inXile to work on either one, although I guess Shadowrun would be an OK fit."", ""I don't think this is going to result in anything good.

Games I really really liked:

I have started my own blog and have been playing each Final Fantasy game in order. I would love if you check it out and let me know what you think. I posted the FF5 review recently and would love to be able to discuss it with you guys!

After playing 5 games I feel this one is the best of the first 5. What are your thoughts?

Throw in the capacity to cast white magic and now you have a paladin! ', ""It's my personal favorite in the series. I'm a sucker for job classes and and a classic fantasy story.""]"
rpg_gamers,t3_9v1woc,"Labyrinth of Refrain | The best blobber ive played in awhile.Ok so im on a video game site and i see a thread with a screen shot of groups fighting enemies that are female rears and thicc thighs. So of course im interested. I finally play this game and the amount of influence of old blobbers and CRPGs is just....amazing. you can tell they really liked old games.

First i will warn thar the graphics are anime-ish but if that doesn't bother you this game is amazing.

Exploring and fighting these enemy designs is just fun as hell. It is also quite a challenge. Theres really no good walkthroughs for this so it definitely feels pre-internet.

Apologies if I\'m off topic. \n\nMage: The Ascension (and Mage: Sorcerer\'s Crusade)\n\nThese games use a  skill-based magic system, as opposed to a spell based system like D&amp;D. So say you want to do something fairly typical like shoot a fire arrow. Well in Mage you would need to use your ""Forces"" skill. Now manipulating a small bit of fire is relatively easy so we\'ll say difficulty 4, but you want to hit someone with it and he\'s got a high agility so that\'s -3 to hit... okay roll a 7 to hit! So the thing it allows you to do is always use your magic creatively, rather than picking your magic from a list. \n\nMage: The Ascension is set the modern world. Mage: Sorcerer\'s Crusade is set in the Renaissance. Those settings would be the past and present of the same world though. Mage is all about this kind of battle for the power of belief. The bad guys are the Technocracy and they want a dark matrix-like future where regular people are cogs in the machine and magic is replaced by microchips. But our heroes are all these misfit mages like a rock and roll bard or a blissed-out junkie sage or a steampunk ethernaut or a martial arts adept who channels his chi through his limbs; all of whom are fighting to keep everyone free and bring hope and all that jazz. It\'s like a battle for the very soul of mankind in a way. \n\nMage is one of the White Wolf World of Darkness games along with Vampire: The Masquerade and Werewolf: The... whateveraning. So you can mix them up if you like... though it\'s a nightmare to try to use 2 (or more) different power systems at the same time so maybe don\'t. \n\nTL;DR Mage: The Ascension has a skill-based magic system that allows a lot of creativity and is very easy to learn and play.

A little known game by Square for the SNES made primarily by the SaGa team at the very end of the SNES' lifespan, it was actually their last game for the system and was only released in Japan, both because it was late and due to the way magic worked thought to be impossible to translate.  Magic works by building spells based on various combinations of syllables to make mantras.  These syllables each have unique effects and you can freely craft them at any point, even randomly typing things in for a result.  Some combinatioms of seemingly useless syllables you find are used to craft powerful mantras that surpass normal ones and other combinations are hidden entirely creating a drive for experimentation.\n\nFurther cementing the uniquenesa is the fact that the game has three interacting plots that you switch between.  While equipment and items don't carry between, the syllables can be used freely, meaning a mantra found in on scenario can be used in another.  And all of these are gorgeously animated, the whole game is.\n\nMiraculously, it was translated into English entirely over a decade ago, and with SNES emulation more or less perfect, it is very easy to play now and get the full experience.

The possibilities of the system are quite impressive, though I was unable to get far into that game due to my dislike of everything real-timed.\n\nA few of the older games feature complex magic system where you have to combine ingredients/syllables/runes to cast spells, but those are usually not very fun, just cumbersome (see CRGPAddict's review of [Legend](http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2018/04/game-288-legend-1992.html))."", 'I pretty much will suggest Divinity Original Sin 2 for almost any situation :)', 'Mages of Mystralia', 'Two worlds two has an awesome magic system where you creat your own spells', 'Best recommendations:\n - Old AD&amp;D cRPGS, Baldurs\'s Gate 2 in particular.

I'm going to start streaming tomorrow, but before I blindly jump in I'll be doing just a bit of research to prepare for my attempt, and while I'm at it I figured a big community like you guys must know your stuff so it wouldn't hurt to ask for fresh advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9u7kqz/im_a_relative_newbie_when_it_comes_to_western/,"[""Keep a web browser tab open to google al the arcane terminology, esp. if you're new to D&amp;D."", ""Baldur's Gate has a substantial following even now, so don't worry about getting bored with it and having to go to BG2. BG has its own strengths that BG2 doesn't have, and it's a pretty good game.\n\nJust to add additional points the other comments might not have covered  -\n\n1. The first game really makes you earn your experience points and levels, so don't worry if you see you'e not getting levelled up too fast.\n2. Solve sidequests as much as you can for XP.\n3. Most of the maps are wilderness maps, but there's a sense of calm zen in clearing out the fog of exploration in every map - plus, you always get at least two or three fun encounters with quirky characters, and fighting monsters is terrific for XP.\n4. This game, more so than BG2 and most other RPGs, has very idiosyncratic dialogue options. Have fun with them.\n5. The flipside is that your companions don't have any particular characteristics (this changes massively in BG2) and won't really interact outside of their personal questlines. Because of this, you don't really need to get attached to anyone and can freely switch characters if you want.\n6. That being said, if you want to keep evil companions, make sure your reputation doesn't exceed 18.\n7. If you're going to start as a pure wizard, you're going to get killed a lot. Never stay at the frontlines unless you've webbed or entangled your enemies and are safe to cast powerful spells.\n8. Ranged characters are great to have.\n9.

It\'s very linear, which some would say is a bad thing, but it\'s great gameplay offsets any issues you\'ll have with that.  There\'s a reason this is one of the best selling games on the PS2. Highly recommended. \n', ""You can pick up quite a few off steam.

It's a fairly basic setup, with a simple story. All characters stick to a single class and simply gain spells and abilities as they level.\n\nFF7 was another huge entry point for many to the series and has a fairly expansive world and an engaging story. The magic system is a little odd, involving equipment setups, but isn't too overbearing to learn. Some don't think the polygonal graphics have aged well, but they're still serviceable and the hand-drawn backdrops hold up.\n\nFFX was the next large influx of newcomers to the series. It features more modern graphics and full voice acting. I found it a bit lead-by-the-nose throughout, but it is still one of the better entries and a good first choice.\n\nFFIX is my absolute favorite by the way, and a good game in its own right, but it rides high on nostalgia and nods to elements from the previous games of the series, like a love letter to classic FFs. It was the last of the old guard before the series cut ties with its more fantastical/steampunk roots in favor of more modern and technological entries."", ""I think X is a good sweet spot between old and new Final Fantasy and a good way to ease players into earlier entries.

Think of it as a Japanese Arcanum, but even more broken. It\'s also very grindy if you don\'t know what you\'re doing (and at first you definitely won\'t) so be warned. \n* Final Fantasy 6 if you want a linear non-RPG (it\'s much closer to Sierra and LucasArts adventure games than to role-playing games) with good plot and characters, at least in a ""shonen"" sense.

This tactic is inadvisable for all but the first few bosses in the game however and stronger enemies require more tactical approach. There's also a very deep skill customization system which allows you to tailor your party members to fill specific roles in an interesting way.\n\nIt also runs great on PC and looks great too. It's a bit more political than earlier Final Fantasy games, but has a more Westernized feel to it's world-building so there's a lot less Japanese cultural references that are thrown into the series making it easier to get into for someone not as familiar with JRPGs.\n\nI personally love the game, but it's a polarizing one, and some people genuinely dislike it so read a few reviews and decide if it's right for you.\n\nI'd actually argue *against* playing **Final Fantasy VII** as your first one. It has not aged well and that goes not only for the graphics but the translation which is very poor in some areas. I'm not saying *don't* play it, it's actually a great game and I really like it, but I don't think it's the best place to get into the series at."", 'FF1-6 with an emulator.\n\nMaybe IX, rest are skippable', ""I'm not sure what is a good entry point for players who never tried final fantasy games.  \nI think final fantasy X is the best overall and has also a remastered version on steam.

rpg_gamers,t3_9twr88,"Dragon Age or Mass Effect first?Hi all. I just recently got started with my backlog of PS3 games and I've stumbled upon mass effect trilogy and dragon age 1 and 2. I'm having trouble deciding on which one to play first. I've read that dragon age origins is a phenomenal game but is extremely long. 
I just cant decide on what series to play first. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9twr88/dragon_age_or_mass_effect_first/,"['Dragon age if you prefer medieval stuff mass effect if you prefer scifi. You can go wrong either way.\n\nBut i prefer dragon age origins (because i love medieval themes)', 'Mass Effect.\nDragon Age 1 is a great game (the sequel is less so), but Mass Effect trilogy is just epic.', 'Both are amazing. Id go for mass effect first because it was alot lighter for me than dragon age,plus the firat dragon age was alot better than the sequel imo.\nBut youre in for long hours of fun either way', 'You decide, dragon age 1 was awesome, 2 super forgettable, the last pretty good.\nMass effect 1 and 2 are incredible games. 3 is passable. 4 should be avoided like the plague.\n\nThe first titles of both series are awesome games, and they both are long to play, so I guess you should just decide if you prefer medieval stuff vs space stuff.', 'How does the combat hold up in each first installment?', 'I prefer Dragon Age: Origins. Mass Effect 2 &amp; 3, while being great games, are more third-person shooters with RPG elements than true RPGs.', ""I liked Mass Effect more than Dragon Age really only for two major reasons. 1: You can't go back even on the same map before your one shot at some encounters / gear is gone in Dragon Age. Mass Effect is almost as linear, but not as harsh on expecting you to see/guess everything the first time. 2: Some sets of gear are frustrating to build in Dragon Age, so I ended up holding a lot of one-item-short sets of armor for a long time. Not as much an issue in Mass Effect."", ""Well that all depends on what you're looking for. Mass Effect is a bit more action oriented, while Dragon Age is more tactical. Mass Effect has better writing and story, but it's actually way longer because the story is three games long, while the Dragon Age games aren't direct continuations of one another (you can make some choices that carry over through games but nothing big) so you can play the DA games in any order, while Mass Effect is best to be played with a single save file over all three."", 'I started with Dragon Age, and I\'m glad I did. Origins was the only one I played, and although it was my favourite, I think the ""best for last"" idea doesn\'t apply here. If you\'re going to play Mass Effect, you better play the whole trilogy. So, it would be a long wait to play Origins after you play the trilogy back to front, because you will be strongly compelled to. It\'s also neat to see how Bioware progressed as a company; if you play DAO, then the ME trilogy, it will be in chronological order.', ""Having played dragon age origins and mass effect 1 both within the last year, I'd say mass effect is more fun.  \n\n\nDA:O\n\n\\- Tolkienesque fantasy\n\n\\- combat makes heavy use of active pausing\n\n\\- A lot of content is similar to or inspired by other western rpgs (inventory management, reading books for lore, attributes/skills/abilities, etc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMass Effect 1\n\n\\- Epic Space fantasy\n\n\\- real time combat with a lot of first person shooter elements\n\n\\- Content doesn't carry as much baggage from other games.  Story and characters are top tier, but some ideas have mixed reactions (such as mako exploration)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDragon Age Origins was frustrating to me because it went out of its way to develop a new rpg system for the game, yet the new system has all the same baggage and clunky design decisions that bog standard dnd has, so it feels like the innovation was way too extensive for what turns out to be a pretty meaningless change in the abstract.  Moment to moment combat is more about managing the rng and bad party ai than about making real tactical decisions, and a lot of difficulty is the fake kind where your build choice matters more than anything you do with your build.  Mages are better than non mages in every possible way and balance is non-existent.  The game forces you to have at least one rogue for opening chests, but without that, there is no strategic reason why playing a rogue is any good at all.    \n\n\nMass Effect 1 also uses a class system where multiple classes are just better than the others, but if you play on normal, any class choice is valid and all playstyles are rewarding to use, based on personal preference.  The character writing is stronger, particularly because the main character isn't a blank slate and the writers make strong use of Shepard as a character instead of an audience surrogate.  The story structure of ME1 works a bit better than DA:O because ME1 has an overarching narrative about investigation, so each individual episode can be somewhat self-contained without breaking the immersion of the overall plot.  Whereas DA:O is about a fast moving invasion, so its weird how most of the game the invasion is a background element that doesn't seem to matter that much."", ""DA:O is roughly 80 hours long (with the Stone Prisoner, Return to Ostagar and Warden's Keep DLCs), plus there's a ~20 hr Awakening expansion. I think you can beat the Mass Effect trilogy in roughly the same time (i.e. ~ 100 hrs) if you aren't keen about picking all the collectibles in ME1, mining all the resources in 2, and maxxing out the war assets in ME3, but still do all the side quests. If you skip on some of these, it's even shorter."", ""Ohh gees, you have not played these games yet? I'm so jealous that you get to experience them for the first time. Honestly, it does not matter which one you play first, it depends on your mood. The Mass Effect trilogy and Dragon Age Origins are both a must for RPG fans that enjoy games that are story driven. Dragon Age 2 on the other hand is not that great. Btw, if you have a decent PC, I recommend playing DAO on that instead of console."", ""It really doesn't matter. Whichever you want first.\n\nDragon Age 2 is taking place before Dragon Age 1.\n\nMass Effect are a saga and the story is continued in the 2nd and 3rd game, whereas in the 3rd it also ends.  \n\n\nOn a side note I think Dragon Age Inquisition is taking place after DA 1 and 2, it's not entirely connected and IMO is not necessary to play, also not a very good game IMO. Also Mass Effect Andromeda is not connected at all, it's also a massive failure and a disaster, so don't even think about playing it."", 'Mass Effect.

It is easier to digest.', 'Mass Effect series. No contest.', ""The mass effect trilogy is amazing and tells one complete story. I recommend playing through that one first.

You can play as one of these characters (still can run pretty much any build you want on them) or create a custom character.

I've really enjoyed my time with the game, and I've found the story surprisingly compelling.  What has hit me the most throughout is how much of a tribute to the BG games it is, especially where you spend the first act wandering the wilderness and helping small settlements across a relatively big portion of the game world, but when you enter the city and act 2, the pace changes completely and you are left to explore a multi-screen area and get lost with a massive quest dump.

It\'s main flaw is the absence or goal (you have to make yours), but surviving itself won\'t be that easy on long term, and it is a good game if you want to learn about the way of life people may have had in the Iron Age, or how the Sami, or other Arctic Natives, lived not that long ago.

I liked the Celtic influence. The world was bleak and rich. I hated the castle / keep mechanics. Hated some choices they made with the game, thats for sure. But overall  It was fresh enough to keep me engaged for 50 hours. The game reminded me of a poor man's modern take on Baldur's gate. The expansion white march reminded me of Icewind Dale with the setting and the more combat focused gameplay. \n\n\nThe game was fine, but in the future I'd prefer more games like Divinity Original Sin over Pillars of Eternity. "", ""For me it is mainly the lore and story. I find it interesting and unique enough to draw me in. For me single player RPG games these days are about the story and world more then the experience. Not that I didn't enjoy the experience but I can see its flaws.\n\nI played and love Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale back in the day and so happily backed PoE when the kick starter showed up.\n\nWhen it came out I didn't play it straight away but when I did it was a bit of a slog as it had been a while since I had played a game like this. I found the story interesting and the companion arcs fun. Completed the main story and some optional stuff. Then went on to other games and bought the expansions when on sale.\n\nThat said I liked it enough to back Deadfire. I decided to jumped back in to the first game with a fresh run before the release of Deadfire and also experience the expansions.\n\nThis time however I dedicated a lot more time to it focusing on my party to get them working together better and understanding the underlying systems in more detail.  This really made me fall in love with the combat and leveling a lot more and this time although there was still some tough fights the successes were so much more satisfying. I have played a little of DOS2 and do prefer the real time with pause over turn based. Being able to control the flow and react on the fly is what makes it more satisfying for me. \n\nOn top of the overall better experience with the game itself I made an effort to really delve into the lore and story. I made an effort to read as many books as I could and do most of the companion quest. l chose to specifically playing a cipher for Eder's quest. I can agree that there can be a lot of text but as a heavy reader I loved that. The thing I love about computer games in terms of story telling compared to books is the fact that the world can be made incredibly dense with information but not force it upon you. The game can provide all the information it needs for the main story arc but also provide countless tidbits and further details throughout the world that you can absorb at your leisure. Books, side quests, random NPC conversations all help build up that world and I thought it was fantastic in Pillars. Backer stories I did ignore as I consider them fun but useless to the actual world.\n\nOn top of those two aspects I think the White March elements and story are great additions to the main game so that really improved my second playthrough. \n\nThen when I was done with that play through I jumped straight into Deadfire and felt it was more of the same in a exciting new part of the world.  The QoL changes were great and the main story although short was a good continuation from the first.  The ship combat was a bit dull for me so that was a drag trying to get into the party based combat ASAP. And to top it off the exploration was very satisfying( I love maps and mapping :)).  I haven't touched the expansion yet but will wait a while and take on the whole experience again. "", 'I really want to like it, because the graphics are fantastic, the combat to me is a lot of fun (I prefer real time with pause to turn based), and the writing is solid (if overly grim).\n\nMy complaints are mostly technical. Despite having a decent pc, the load times are long and frequent. The questing UI does not help you parse the deluge of sidequests you are given (completed quests are a slightly lighter shade of gray in the list instead of being removed--who the heck thought that was a good idea). And the character upgrade process is a bit too convoluted--I never had a sense of if I was making good choices (though admittedly you can pay for rerolls).', 'The weaknesses of PoE1 are the setting, as PoE1 mostly fails to emphasise the aspects setting it apart from generic DnD worlds, and the misses in its hit and miss cast of companions. From a narrative perspective the game also doesn\'t do a good job making the player care about the antagonist, although again the they are actually a pretty interesting character. Writing is good, obviously I disagree with people complaining about there being too much writing or supposed ""purple prose"". The combat systems are well balanced and bring many good ideas to the classic formula. UI and npc AI also pull ahead of similar crpgs. The character build systems are good but perhaps a little over-balanced and I can\'t get lost in theory crafting the way I can with with classic PnP games like bg, IWD, PK. Difficulty settings are well implemented. Graphics are excellent. A few areas spam combat encounters too much. All across the board there\'s a ton of quality of life stuff which an old time BG fan should be able to appreciate.\n\nPoE2 added multiclassing, making the game much more interesting to theory craft, and engaged the player much more effectively in the story and the world. Many companions were interesting (wouldn\'t have been my choice of companions to carry forwards though...), the factions were interesting, the antagonist had depth, the setting was highly distinctive. More convenience features were added including customisable AI macros and a greater shift to per encounter skills. I\'m lukewarm on some of these changes - in particular casters feel much blander than previously. There was an obvious effort to cut down on slog encounters and a good balance of island hopping, combat and questing, with side quests being as diverse as any I\'ve seen in an RPG. The biggest problem added in PoE2 was the increase in open world elements, which totally fucked up the difficulty scaling in the second half of the game at release. The ship, which replaced the keep, doesn\'t really detract from the experience but is certainly a missed opportunity as there\'s no persuasive reason not to ignore ship combat and developing your naval resources. The other issue is the large amount of factions and sub factions can be difficult to tell apart.\n\nThey\'re both 9/10 for me with the second having a more engaging first play through but the original having more replayability.', ""It's the closest thing to another Baldur's Gate. Is it as good? No. But I still enjoyed it. "", ""It was the first of the isometric CRPG revival. I remember liking it when it came out because it unapologetically tried to emulate Baldur's Gate / Icewind Dale and people were starved for those games at that point but I can see why it hasn't aged that well.

I think that POE would ve better if they stuck with regular combat mechanics. I think that the experimental mechanics were a bit of a failure. "", ""PoE 1 is one of the only RPGs(and RPGs are 90% of what I play) I never finished because the combat bored me so much.  There was so much filler trash combat that I got to the point where I was hoping around that corner up ahead wasn't another garbage useless fight....and every time there was.  The game was just a slog.\n\nOn top of that, it's nice to get some decent loot once in a while and I was going so long between upgrades it made the boring combat just that much more unbearable.

The game was too much of a slog and my preferred character(Monk) was lackluster; they never seemed strong but always just barely scraping by instead of One Punch Man, I was One Pushover Man. I played when it first came out because I backed it and there was quite a bit that was clunky and didn't seem all that smooth; the real problem for me was doing so many sidequests before I even discovered there was a stronghold in the game. In the end it was the backer souls that did it in for me. There were so many and as far as I could tell they were completely pointless. It just made me resent every little problem I came across that much more because imagine if they didn't have to put in these 100 extra npcs with random flavor text.\n\nI found Tyranny to be a better experience in every possible way except the unarmed class, which was just as lackluster as Pillars."", ""Like Deadfire a lot more than PoE1. They're good games but lack , at least the first one , lack some major quality of life. Deadfire is better game and with slighty worse writting. They're def not for all people tho. Niche games."", ""It's relatively original, and it has party creation. \n\nI'm sick of all the D&amp;D ruleset games. While much of what's in Pillars is borrowed from D&amp;D, it's still different enough. And party creation is relatively rare. \n\nAnd it's all a matter of perspective, really. I think The Witcher 3 and Hollow Knight are absolute garbage and two of the most overrated games of all time.

"", ""I wanted to like it but it has boring af characters and I couldn't do it"", ""It's an rpg that puts the roleplaying elements in it. You have a somewhat customizable backstory and it reflects in dialogue. Same with your race, culture, personality, attributes..given it's not perfect but looking at how so many rpgs are going the predefined protagonist route its nice to have a game that let's you have a bit more control over your PC (at least as it fits the story, that is). \n\nI didn't like the first one's combat but the second I enjoy very much. I love the reactivity and the choices you can make, the fact that companions are somewhat customizable (including the option to make your own), I just don't see that in a lot of rpgs. I also love Deadfire's unconventional non-Tolkienesque setting and replayability. \n\nI love PoE and the world of Eora in general but that's just my own humble opinion. Others' mileage indeed varies. "", ""I have only played PoE1, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had tepid expectations because I had heard from a couple of reliable sources that the story was boring, the characters uninteresting, and that the combat just was not any good. Obviously, I did not have that same experience. I actually think that the overall plot and story were very well written and engaging, although it did drag a bit at times. I also liked the companions, except for that xenophobic dude who gabbed way too much. I think that Aloth and Eder in particular had very interesting back stories and I loved the conversations with them, and their quests. Of course, it is inevitable to compare it to the BG series, and that is fair since said series is the primary inspiration for PoE. I enjoyed it a lot more than Baldur's Gate 1 as I feel that the story and character interactions on PoE1 are superior to that game. It certainly is not on the same level as Baldur's Gate 2 or Planescape: Torment, but it isn't really fair to expect any game to be. I do admit that the combat is kind of a weak point of the game, but I enjoyed the other aspects so much that it didn't really bother me much in the long run. I also had fun with the stronghold and Endless Paths. I liked that I could just go back to them periodically when I wanted a break from the normal questing; they were fun and engaging side activities. "", 'I think they are great games.  Great graphics, story telling, voice acting, and combat IMO.  I think they have great companions.  To each their own.  Love the multiclassing in PoE2']"

I'm finally through programming the basics of combat and getting to the good stuff: enemies.

Ideally, and as my skill allows, I would like to create opponents that not only have different stats, movesets, mobility options, etc, but also have different strategies for defeating the player. For example, instead of straight damage, certain enemies would attempt to disrupt the player formation with pulls and teleports, while others instead rely on disabling characters at a distance with a stun before closing in. 

Enemies in the game are based on SCP-inspired anomalies, so the trick to combat is figuring out how each enemy behaves.

An example would be throwing a fireball that has range 3 and then the enemy uses the same spell but it has range 6.

rpg_gamers,t3_9p6vvx,"Trying to play some more classic pc RPG games wanted to get some suggestions on what to playSo ive beaten fallout 1 and am currently playing fallout 2. Ive poured like 20 hours into fallout 2 so far, doing every quest i can find, enjoying every minute (Finally got my hands on the highwayman and have upgraded it too :P) 

Ive realised i wanna start getting into some more classic PC RPGS. So ive been adding the games to get to my wish list. 

I also dont mind if you recommend modern RPGS as well (Ive included some modern games in the list below) but i would prefer if you recommended some classics. One big reason i like the classics (Aside from Deep RPG mechanics) is there gorgeous 2D Sprites and art styles, i feel like they age very well and look great. A lot of the modern full 3d rpgs just dont look as great as those prerendered backgrounds imo

Also **No JRPGS** please, i do love jrpgs but not really in the mood for any right now (Recently poured a gazillion hours into Persona 5)

------

So far the games im going to eventually play are:

* Baldurs Gate: Enhanced Edition 

* Baldurs Gate: Seige of Dragonspear

* Baldurs II: Enhanced Edition 

* Planescape: Torment 

* Pillars of Eternity 

* Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire

I know its a pretty small list, thats why im asking you guys for help.

I love what stuff like Pillars and Divinity have been doing and all but it\'s nice to still have a place for the classics you know? Really scratches that tabletop itch for when getting a group together is difficult. \n\nThe story is pretty great and just exploring the world is a great time - of course with this being a straight adaptation of Pathfinder that\'s to be expected and it has Chris Avellone on the team. Mechanics are great too for the same reason, when they\'re working that is.\n\nWhich leads me on to the main problem with it: This game is so blatantly unfinished it\'s staggering. By all rights it should have been released as an early access because I think it\'s quite clear it was pushed out early to continue to fund development. Half the abilities in the game are broken in some form, most of the companion quests are unfinishable if they show up at all, no one understands how the kingdom management (the main hook of the game) actually functions due to bugs, and worst of all the bugs are practically guarantee\'d to compound and ""tantrum spiral"" your game into breaking and failing the campaign. The storyline has hard time limits on how long you have to do most things + if your kingdom collapses it\'s an instant Game over so most people simply can\'t finish it.\n\nAs an example of how broken things are, I had to reroll *my very first character immediately after starting the game* due to a core class feature not working (Bonded Items for Arcane Sorcerer). That\'s how  omnipresent the bugs are - entire subsets of abilities are busted and the current meta revolves around which classes actually function as intended + which break in ways that are OP. A new bug introduced in a patch messed with the way one of the companion\'s armour class is calculated - so now Valerie the fighter, formerly the core tank of your frontline, gets absolutely mullered in melee combat.\n\nThe devs admiteddly have been patching the game like madmen but on the other hand a lot of these patches are untested so they can introduce even more bugs. Now as a longtime cRPG and tabletop fan I am able to enjoy the game despite all of this (for now a least) and I\'m willing to wait for things to get fixed in the meantime, but the main point of my comment here is for people who are wondering whether to pick Pathfinder Kingmaker up: **Don\'t**. If you\'re like me then great, but if you aren\'t then understand that this game is currently fundamentally broken in ways that haven\'t been seen since the likes of Arkham Knight. \n\nMy advice is to wait a month or two till the myriad gamebreaking bugs have been fixed and pick it up then if you\'re interested, or get it on sale. As it is it\'s simply nowhere near worth the pricetag for anyone outside the most dedicated of fans. There\'s a genuinely great game simmering under all this crap but right now it\'s just not there.', 'Completed **Horizon: Zero Dawn** including the Frozen Wilds expansion. Utterly delightful. Could not put it down. \n\nBut I was itching for a JRPG after that experience, so I fired up **Tales of Zestiria**. Good opening, will be interested to see if it lives...down?...to the hype.', ""Pathfinder: Kingmaker. Best Baldur's Gate since Baldur's Gate. "", 'I\'ve been in a nostalgic mood and since Mass Effect is over ten years old (oh my god), I decided to do a final playthrough of the whole series. Mass Effect 1 was as good as I remember. I adore the codex they implemented. Essentially it\'s a big information repository which is nicely narrated that will detail things from planets, to specific technologies etc. It really fleshes the world out. There are also secondary codex entries that aren\'t narrated, these go into the nitty gritty details of a race\'s individual belief systems/cultures. It\'s given me much more of an appreciation of the universe Bioware made back in the day.\n\nI\'ve read a lot of retrospectives on this game and people always mention the combat having aged exceptionally poorly. I\'m just not one of these people. I don\'t absolutely adore it, but I think it\'s perfectly fine. In fact, I really enjoy the shotgun in the game because it sounds like an absolute cannon. The mako, however, that was so much worse than I remember. Controlling that thing is like controlling a piece of cardboard with an asymmetrical number of balloons on each side that act as wheels. Oh yeah, just do a random gravity defying flip and send us tumbling down a mountain, mako.\n\nI\'m onto Mass Effect 2 now and am pleasantly surprised at the amount of little things that carry over when you import your save-file. It\'s probably my favourite out of the trilogy because it\'s just this moody adventure through the lawless parts of the galaxy you hear about in ME1, with a large cast of characters and places. Even if you play your main character unquestioningly ""good"", he\'s still got a little bit of attitude which fits.\n\nI\'m probably going to be called a masochist for this, but I miss items from the first game. The idea of them, anyway. There\'s very little mechanical customisation in ME2 outside of some basic armour choices and a selection of guns (which you can unlock in mission x, y, z etc). Whereas in ME1 I could outfit my squad to quite a granular degree.\n\nNot that it\'s a deal breaker, I play these games for the characters and the galaxy more than anything, but still.

rpg_gamers,t3_9omb3z,"The question of balanceIt's pretty much omnipresent, especially when it comes to video games and mmorpgs. ""This ability is too powerful!"" or ""You can't succeed in this fight/skill check/situation with that build."" 

I get where it comes from, we don't like to fail, at least I don't. And many companies, especially those making video games, address this issue with constant rebalancing of builds and items.


But I can't help but wonder if the ""balance"" is actually worth the effort. For me, big part of enjoyment I draw from RPGs, is figuring out strategy or approach to solve some issue.

Sure, I don't like impossible challenge, but I definitely don't expect, or want, all strategies to be equal. I mean, it would kind of defeat the very purpose of planning if all plans were just as valid, wouldn't it?


The best example of what I'm talking about, in video game RPGs, is Fallout (only the real ones 1, 2 and NV), where picking wrong combination of skills and stats, can literally block you from entire sections of the game. Which I actually like, because it gives my choice a value.

And, on the opposite end of the spectrum, is Mass effect 3. Not it's ending, although that was atrocious too regarding the choice. But the plot line in general. 

While there were many choices to make, too often they ended up leading you to a same place. Take the genophage situation, make wrong decisions and the cure is impossible. But it doesn't change anything about the outcome. You get an army either way. 

Sure, some characters will die, but the next mission will be exactly the same as if they lived. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9omb3z/the_question_of_balance/,"['Encounter and loot scaling aka ""level scaling"" is one of the worst things to happen to RPGs. It\'s a disease.\n\nThere should be optimal and fail-states. A bad build or tactic should be crushed.\n\nBeware the fanatical ""Balance Priests"". Worst devs ever. Don\'t buy their games. ', 'The problem is with games that ask you to make decisions without giving you enough information. Like in many RPGs where you have a big freedom in creating a character.\n\nMost D&amp;D games, Fallout 1/2, Arcanum - all of them allow you to create a relatively weak character. And it\'s not just a problem in old games, Wasteland 2 happily allowed me to create a professional sniper who doesn\'t have enough AP to shoot sniper rifle. There are often skills that might be very useful or not useful at all - e.g. depending on a game skills might have a very specific application for special builds or sometimes they\'re completely useless. Such systems add replayability and can be great when you already know the game and want to experiment, but it often looks like a clumsy noob traps. Those games have recommended settings or premade characters but they\'re not ""default"" option. Some games do it better, like Blackguards which highly encourages you to use one of archetypes which can be customized later.\n\nMany RPGs go too far, like Skyrim which gives you a character that is good at everything on level 1 (curiously Fallout 4 from Bethesda doesn\'t do that) and only later allows you to specialize. It looks better in games like Gothic or Risen or Witcher. You specialize your character gradually when you see how the world works. You make informed decisions about choosing a favorite weapon or investing in skills like alchemy or lockpick; you can check how useful those skills are. \n\nStill all of it only really becomes a problem in a hard game where you can\'t compensate for your mistake. Most RPGs still have generous level cap and some sort of grinding so the difference between good and bad build is time spent on getting powerful enough to fight through any obstacle. Game designers have to go out of their way to spoil that, like with an infamous example of Oblivion that happily allowed you to specialize in speech, trading and thievery and then suddenly throwing autoleveled hordes of hell at you.', 'Idk i think having a build that blocks your progression is bad game design. And you can complete all the fallouts regardless of build. Some dialogue and quests are barred out but that makes sense given your professions.\n\nLike when Pillars of Eternity was being made they especially made sure to make sure every strategy is viable. A player shouldnt be punished for playing a certain way.', '&gt;Sure, I don\'t like impossible challenge, but I definitely don\'t expect, or want, all strategies to be equal. I mean, it would kind of defeat the very purpose of planning if all plans were just as valid, wouldn\'t it?\n\nThat\'s a problem I have with ""builds"" in some RPGs. Games that give you the freedom of allocating your stat and skill points and things like that. More often than not, when you reach end game you have like less than a handful of viable/good builds while all else sucks. If in the end it becomes so restrictive, why give us the freedom anyway?', 'The most important thing is that every build is viable and can finish the game. No illusion of choice. ']"

rpg_gamers,t3_9okoww,"Games similar to FF XV?Hi all, this is my first time posting here so sorry if this sort of question isn’t allowed. I recently got Final Fantasy XV for the Xbox and I love it. Does anyone have recommendations for other similar games I could play? I have an xbox one and ps4. 

I looked at Dragon Quest XI on Twitch but I really didn’t like it for some reason, it felt more grindy and difficult than FF XV to me and I’m not really in it for a very challenging time, more to pass the time with some fun and a good story. I’d appreciate any ideas you have. Thanks!

rpg_gamers,t3_9oht9m,"PC RPGs with a really engaging story.Looking for any PC RPGs with an engaging story to keep me hooked until the end. Or at least enough to make me wanna see what happens at the end.

I've played Divinity Original Sin, and the second one is also on my list. Witcher 3 I couldn't get into (I know I know, blasphemy). The combat really turned me off on release and I just haven't gotten around to trying to again. The scope of it puts me off right now. Would like to get back into the flow with something else.

Please don't suggest any Elder Scrolls/Fallout Games. I have played them all and the story never was captivating enough to get me to actually finish it. I get maybe halfway and get bored in all of them. The only exception being New Vegas but with the constant crashing I get even with mod patches and stuff it's basically unplayable for me sadly. I hope one day to give it a proper go through without crashes every 5-10 minutes. I know Fallout 1 + 2 are different. I would like to play them as I've heard they are good but I need to be in the right mindset as from what I know they can be difficult/you can screw it up and I'm still a newb at such games.

Open to all and other suggestions. Age of the game doesn't bother me as long as it's PC and playable (would prefer not emulators. I know there are some old gems out there for the old consoles but I really never have enjoyed playing on an emulator). Really would like to reignite my love for RPGs which got me into gaming in the first place many years ago.

The  “Dawn of Ultima” is a multi-player adventure game that takes place  shortly after the events of Ultima III: Exodus, and on an alternate  timeline. It takes place in the land of Sosaria, where you create a  character that tries to make their way through this enormous world. You  will have to find a way to feed yourself, and acquire equipment to  explore your way around. Everything you need to know can be learned  within the virtual environment. Knowledge can be acquired by talking to  the citizens of the land, or you may find a book or scroll with clues  and other information. There are also some commands you can use to bring  up additional information.

The game Is  designed for characters to adventure alone. You can even craft items  from your home, and have them purchased by the Merchants Guild if you  choose to make your living that way. Your health, mana, and stamina are  valued at double the associated attribute. So if you have a strength of  50, your health will be 100. You can also obtain the title of  grandmaster in 10 different skills, which should allow you to create a  character type of your choice (like a wizard, fighter, thief, assassin,  etc).

This game is designed around older  MUD methodologies and rules based on early 1970’s Dungeons &amp; Dragons  games. The spirit of this game is far removed from that of Ultima  Online, and is simply a game of exploration and discovery. The world  consists of 9 different lands, over 20 cities and villages, and over 100  dungeons to explore. Settlements sell their own goods and may change  from time to time, but the merchants can be helpful in repairing or  identifying items. Every skill in the game has a worthwhile purpose  again, and some spells have been enhanced to either become useful again  or work better within a single player environment. Death brings with it  penalties upon resurrection, either in the form of negative character  effects or the parting of gold as tribute to the gods that bring your  life back.

Dungeons are filled with many  hideous monsters, but they contain much treasure. They can be filled  with many hidden traps with varying effects. Some may harm you with  fire, lightning, or poison. Others may curse one of your items or simply  make it vanish. You could trip over a well-placed wire, breaking your  potion bottles or arrows. You could even be hit with a magical force  that turns all of your coins into lead. Traps can perhaps be avoided by  those skilled in such things, have magic that protects them from such,  or even have luck on their side altogether. Some even carry a ten-foot  pole to set off traps safely.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9od19f/dawnofultimacom/,['Why is this a self-post instead of linking directly to the website?']

I would like to try some fantasy games that are significantly more down to earth.   
  
Imagine a scene in a city's adventurer guildhall, with a bulletin board of job postings for the day. A bunch of freelancers, from naive bright-eyed or nervous newbies to grizzled or smug veterans, crowd around the board, sizing up the different job postings, grouping up, and taking ones they think they can complete. Kill some goblins here, explore a newly discovered tomb there, harvest some rare herbs in that dangerous forest over there -- who knows what jobs are on that board, but there are a bunch of jobs and they all pay something, and you and the other adventurers present all could use the money. Each one of those adventurers there with you might have interesting motives, backgrounds, ideals to explore. Each one of those jobs on that board could have any number of complications, twists, and turns. Trying to rise the ranks and gain a reputation among freelancers might lead to all sorts of things happening, and doors opening.          
    
I want to play a game where I feel like one of those freelancers for a while, just taking jobs to pay their tab at the tavern, making some allies and rivals, maybe dreaming of one day catching a job to slay a dragon and retiring, or whatever. Maybe the story unfolds and expands as you get to know some of the other freelancers, or powerful people in the places you go, but the main thrust of it is you're an adventurer taking jobs and getting by. Maybe the biggest ""world-impacting"" event in the story is something like, ""as an established freelance adventurer, you're tasked to be part of an expedition to a hitherto undiscovered land, where you learn some crazy historical fact that radically contradicts popular belief."" You know, a climax that is NOT at all on the level of: ""you fight God and win.""       
    
As long as it doesn't come down to ""and you the protagonist, are the sacred prophesied hero! Agent of the gods! Herald of the new era! Born of Dragon! Chosen one! You'll be the new king of the world! If you don't act now the whole world will fall to darkness!"" then I'm interested in it.     
  
Bethesda games can feel this way when you ignore the main quests, and actually a lot of RPGs in general that I've played kinda feel this way *until* the story crosses a certain threshold, when the protagonist's specialness is revealed, either early in the game or midway through the game, and your quest becomes really concrete and super urgent and super earth-shattering.    
  
Any recommendations?

rpg_gamers,t3_9nwhw0,"Old-school and traditionnal RPG's players, what do you think about real roguelikes?Hello virtual rolists,

So, a few days ago, [I asked roguelikes' players why they like such games, and eventually why they prefer them to other RPG's](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/9mflte/what_is_the_thing_that_make_you_like_or_love/) .

But now, I would like to know what people who play crpg's think about (real) roguelikes as a whole. By roguelikes, I of course don't mean games like Binding of Isaac, Dead Cells, Enter the Gungeon, Rogue Legacy, etc... as these aren't actual roguelikes. No, I mean games such as NetHack, ADOM/Ancient Domains of Mystery, Elona, DCSS/Dungeon Crawl : Stone Soup, Angband, Caves of Qud, TOME/Tales of Maj'Eyal etc... to some extent Unreal World,  Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead and Dwarf Fortress. 

To me, it seems that they could satisfy the needs and wants of ol-school and traditionnal rpg's' players, as they offer deep character customization, force you to be very strategical and tactical, have tons of different equipments and items, offer challenge, all the while being much more complex than most games, and allowing much more interactions with the environment, npc's and monsters.

Yet, despite of that, I don't think I have ever seen anyone mention them here. So, what are your thoughts on them, do you play some? if not, why not? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9nwhw0/oldschool_and_traditionnal_rpgs_players_what_do/,"['I use to love nethack. I was never very good at it though. ', 'I think a combination of the basic graphics and the learning curve of figuring out what does what has kept me from getting into most of these games.\n\nThe two exceptions are Sword of the Stars: The Pit and Dungeons of Dredmor. I loved Dredmor\'s humor and I liked the easily readable and quick to learn SotS as well as the scifi theming. \n\nThe thing I **really** love are action rogue-lites. Nuclear Throne is to this day is the game I have the most hours into and I also love Enter the Gungeon and really enjoyed Rogue Legacy. \n\n**EDIT:** Wow, just saw some of the people saying OP is ""gatekeeping."" That\'s nonsense. Roguelike really doesn\'t work for games like Nuclear Throne and Enter the Gungeon, personally I use the term ""action rogue-lite"" for those. \n\nGenres are just short hand to describe certain game mechanics used in design. Saying something is a ""rogue-lite"" versus a ""roguelike"" isn\'t demeaning one or the other. It\'s just trying to be more specific about the type of game you are referring to.\n\nThese subtle differences are fun to discuss.', ""Old-school RPG credo: Betryal at Krondor, Arcanum, Fallout 1&amp;2 (started playing in late 90's).\n\nNever could get into roguelikes. Even graphical version of ADOM available on Steam right now isn't fun for me. I guess I just usually dislike games without storyline and saves (I save obsessively, and any game that doesn't allow me to save anywhere earns a huge minus from me).\n\nI kind managed to have some fun in Sword of the Stars: The Pit, which is, I think, roguelike enough, but I never finished it even once - it's too hard for me.\n\nThing I hate about roguelikes is that they are strategical, not tactical: every specific situation usually isn't very complex, but you need to manage your resources very carefully. And I'm very bad at that. I prefer complex game situations, but ones where the need to plan for the future is limited (for example, I like Desktop Dungeons and Slay the Spire). My ideal game looks like the series of puzzles (in terms of genre's mechanics, those could be hard combats, actual puzzles, or something else), with complete resource restoration between them."", ""I have a few I fire up occasionally, namely Angband and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. And there are other ones I've put a decent amount of time into.\n\nThe sheer randomness of roguelikes can test my patience sometimes, but I keep coming back to them, and I like to try out new (actually new or new to me) ones I come across.\n\nI prefer RPGs because, as I said, the randomness of roguelikes gets to me after awhile, but I do still enjoy roguelikes. Not many other thoughts on them off the top of my head.\n\nAlso, I appreciate the distinction between roguelikes and roguelites because I'm looking for a specific set of elements when I'm seeking out a roguelike to play. And if I'm looking for something that's a bit looser regarding those elements, I'll look for a roguelite. Genres and subgenres are useful for finding exactly what will scratch a particular itch. I listen to a ton of music, and it's the same deal there. It's not about being snobby or gatekeeping or whatever. Not for me, anyway. I don't give a shit what others are into unless it's to recommend more of what they might be into or connect with them over similar interests."", 'I do not like roguelikes that is why i play crpgs.', 'I do play them in the lull between good cRPGs/games to play and sometimes get really invested in one that I ignore all other genres.\n\nI\'ve mainly poured hours upon hours on Elona, ADOM and Angband Variants. Though I did dabble a bit on the more unique ones like Demon, The Ground Gives Way, Cataclysm, and Infra Arcana.\n\nAs to why I like them: I guess the strategy involved, maximizing your limited resources (not applying to Elona), myriad interactions in and out of combat that rewards knowledge, character creation, the gamechanging loot (from consumables to equipment) and importantly the Difficulty.\n\nMost of these have just one Difficulty, and this is why I like them. You will most likely be playing with everyone on the same field, avoiding any confusions or direct comparisons with those who played on a different field level. Sharing experiences becomes a much more enjoyable activity as that other guy told you that he died to a gnome with a wand of death too, or an offscreen Multi-Hued Dragon, or starvation, or from being turned into stone, and you get to laugh and exactly relate to YASD moments.\n\nIt\'s not that I dislike varying difficulty levels (my stance is neutral on it), but sometimes a game does not have to catered to everyone.\n\nCharacter creation is also one of the better characteristics. I don\'t mind having no graphics as I could just think of how my @ looks like similar to how we approach PnP characters. The numerous races and classes add significantly to the replayability and the experience as well as they offer differing playstyles depending on the roguelike, and Poschengband does this the best. ""Should I play as a sentient ring? A tourist Balrog? Probably a Deathsword? or maybe a god spawn of Athena?"" making multiple playthroughs alleviate some of the early game repetitiveness\n\nAlso, a bit on that alleged gatekeeping, the definition of the R-word is a probably a bit touchy in groups outside of non-general/""hardcore"" RPG forums ( like the Codex, r/roguelikes, etc.). Discussions like these also happen in r/Games, so I kinda got that general forums like this sub is kinda not the place to discuss about it.', ""I didn't really get into nethack or adom when i was younger. 2-3 years ago i tried out Tales Of Maj'Eyal and couldn't put it down.

And when I'm in the mood of a dungeon-crawler, I like to control a whole party like in Wizardry. \n\nBut perhaps I played the wrong roguelikes, I don't know. "", 'I play games for the narrative. Challenge is one of my lowest factors in considering a game. I do not like rouge, rouge like, etc. ', 'I first played roguelikes around 2000. There were ADOM, Angband, NetHack. More recently I\'ve played ToME which is more like a traditional RPG.\n\nI\'ve never got any far in those oldschool roguelikes. As I see it now, they relied on you learning the mechanics of the game. Not in a modern understanding of what it means. It\'s not like you make the most effective build, it\'s like you find the only thing that really works. You realize that some classes/races are designed to be better than others. You learn which spells are useless and which can save you. You know that by level 5 of Doom\'s Dungeon of Death you need blindness immunity or be killed, and by level 10 you need defense from petrification and so on. All those custom interactions between items are fun but really it makes games sometimes look like some sort of pixel hunt adventure game. IIRC you have to kick sink to sometimes get something good of it, right?\n\nIt reminds me of those puzzle-style wargames. The ones where there\'s a right set of units and movements that will give you a clear victory and the game is about figuring that out, not simulating combat (an example would be Unity of Command). It\'s that feeling of frustration that stops me from playing. That when the shit is happening you don\'t say ""how will I get out of this problem"", you say ""how will I prepare for this shit when my next character gets here"". You click through solved problems till you get into a new one you didn\'t solve yet and then you think of a solution.

rpg_gamers,t3_9nlkuv,"Why hasn't anyone tried to make story-deep RPG with ARGP mechanics?This is something that has been bugging me for some time. We have all those wonderful game like Pillars, Tyranny, Divinity etc, but combat gameplay always felt a bit underwhelming to me. We have proper technology with computers and consoles and yet RPGs insist on keeping their combat mechanics based on adaptations of pen and paper games. 

Don't get me wrong, pen and paper RPGs are awesome and I wish I had the time to play them like I used to, but their mechanics are basically something of a necessity to facilitate a bunch of people sitting around a table and having fun. To put it briefly - it's not possible to make a real-time tabletop wargame, but on a computer a real time strategy game is somewhat more realistic and immersive.

Yet with RPGs and current technology, I feel like translating tabletop rules to a computer program is kind of a crutch. Sure, turn based combat can be super fun in some cases - just look at Xcom. But when melee combat comes to play, I mostly feel frustrated. It's either real time with pause, when you look at characters standing doing nothing for a second only to swing at the enemy and miss or turn based where it cane take long minutes to kill a few rats.

On the other side of the spectrum we have stuff like Diablo clones or Dark Souls, where the combat is engaging and player skill based, but also take stats and numbers into account, but for some reason, it's all about either loot or just killing bosses.

The Witcher 3 was IMHO the closest game to take advantage of the tech and still have freedom for the player and a deep story, but at the same time, it wasn't Fallout 2 freedom-wise nor Planescape Torment story-wise (though close to the latter in my book at least).

I loved playing Tyranny, but each time I was in combat, especially later in the game, it dragged forever and the RNG was sometimes borderline frustrating. I am currently playing POE2 and it's similar. Divinity Original Sin was a game I dumped simply because I couldn't bare the turn-based combat slog and keep in mind that I am the kind of person who played more than a 100 hours of Flashpoint Campaigns Red Storm.

Please recommend any games that have any combination of these mechanics/design choices for me to play, preferably those you feel do them well!

Branching dialogue that feels organic and allows diverse characters to be roleplayed.

Events that carry on whether the player sees them or not.

Turn-based combat using a single resource for every possible action (like mana).

NPCs that give different quests, depending on your previous actions/dialogue choices.

NPCs that react to the weather and/or time of day.

NPCs that have their own lives which can be observed by the player but have nothing to do with them (conversations at home during dinner etc).

Building on the previous feature, NPCs that don't just cease to exist after they exit a scene, and can be found in the world later.

Gated open worlds that are still interesting when the map is fully accessable.

Open worlds that deter players from accessing certain areas without telling them they can't proceed in an immersion-breaking way.

Top-down open worlds that feel alive and/or look really nice.

Level scaling in enemies based on the strength of your team/party.

Not many choices there! All you can do is work hard with your imagination and try not to fall into the pit, where you have to borrow names. The alternative choice is to use a name generator but most of them require feed names to work, so they sound familiar already.  I knew what I had to do, so I created my own fantasy name generator, which does not require name feeds to function, it works offline, and it has a favorite option. And for those that still can't make the leap, it contains a section of names database that fetches names from favorite novels, pc games, card games, series etc. It's free and it works on android phones and tablets.

rpg_gamers,t3_9mzv7e,"Do you prefer damage scaling by weapon or class?Pure weapon scaling - weapons determine damage

Weapon + attribute scaling - Damage depends on attributes/stats that interact with weapons (ex. Dark Souls)

In D&amp;D the base damage depends on the weapon, and you get a bonus to the attack roll and damage roll from your attributes.

Let skills, feats/talents/whatever you use, and level determine what you can pull off, how damaging you are, etc.  But then I don\'t play even D&amp;D as a loot acquisition game.  Instead let the items you use provide some important but unimportant flavor.  Example:  A big two handed weapon might attack more slowly (same DPS, 2 bursts instead of 4 bursts of damage).

Seriously, this only looks like a huge circle jerk of different senseless bonuses and skills just so they can say ""Every class has over 30 skills!"".\n\n2. Damage scaling with every single piece of gear (armor, shoulders, shield, helmet, etc...).

To me, both games fall into the category Stockholm Syndrome games. By that I mean, because your parents were only willing to buy you 1 or 2 games a year for Christmas and your Birthday, you are forced to spend time with Game. Eventually, you either love Game or you don\'t play anything until the next one.  Notable examples of Stockholm Syndrome games include Planescape Torment, Baldur\'s Gate 1 and 2, and well most of Bioware\'s product line.

Forget all of that because you are the legendary Dragonborn and you have to slay all the dragon, maybe if you feel like it. We won\'t tell you how to play.

rpg_gamers,t3_9mngq7,"Any other good, modern, BioWare style RPGs?Recently it's been very difficult for me to get invested in any game. Neither ever manages to keep my attention for longer than an hour or so.

However, I've loved the Dragon Age and Mass Effect series. I completed the latter around a year ago, despite not being into sci-fi at all - I prefer fantasy settings, and found it my favourite game series up to this point.

All the fairly recent (all the games released since around 2009 count for me) RPG releases seem to either:

* Use isometric cam - while I can understand the appeal, this is a major con for me. I like to enjoy pretty models from up close and witness cinematic cutscenes and dialogues, to see the facial expressions of the other characters etc. (PoE, the new Torment, Divinity: Original Sin)
* Have a dreadful story and poorly written NPCs (Skyrim)
* Actually be more of a slasher (the LotR games)
* Actually MMORPGs despite being listed in the RPG category, which irks me while looking for more titles to play

That being said, does anybody know a game that's different from all of that? I've been going through a ton of titles on Steam and cannot find anything at all.

rpg_gamers,t3_9mn6fa,"Backlog Woes - What to play next?So I know my time with Dragon Quest XI is coming to an end soon. I'm about 115 hrs in, done with most of the post game side quests just doing some trophy cleaning up at the moment. That being said, the massive void in my life will need to be filled by yet again another adventure. My backlog is kinda big, and usually whenever I finish up a game I'm left almost in a daze of ""what now""? So I'm hoping to hear some pros and cons from those who have played some of these titles. 

-Elex
-Tokyo Xanadu eX+
-Rogue Galaxy
-The Surge
-Tales Of Zestiria
-Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness
-Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force
-Final Fantasy 9
-Dark Cloud 2
-Demon Gaze 2
-Disgaea 5
-Bound By Flame
-Arcania the complete tale

For sanity's sake I cut the list down by.. Alot. I know there's a big variety there in game play, styles, artwork, progression, etc. After the huge time investment I put into DQ11 and being the only time I get to play nowadays is usually when the wife and baby are asleep, I'd prefer something that isn't super laborious unless it's totally worth it. DQ11 was totally worth it, my first DQ game and I'm somewhat disappointed in myself that I haven't played any of the other titles. That being said, any and all comments are welcome. If you mention another title that I have and just didn't happen to put on the list, then let's discuss it, maybe I'll give that a go instead! If you happen to mention something that I don't have but recommend it based off of the list I'll look into it and see, but I'd rather not add to the already gruesome list. Let's chat!

Edit: I play on console (PS4), my apologies for not putting that initially. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9mn6fa/backlog_woes_what_to_play_next/,"['Sadly in terms of most of the RPGs listed, I\'ve only heard of and played a few, but I will give my opinions on them. \n\nTales Of Zestiria: The game, over all, is fantastic if you are into JRPGs and the Tales series in general. The Tales series, if you never played before, is a series of Action JRPGs streching all the way back to the 90s. The stories tend to be very cliche and typically what you would have expected from an RPG back in the day, even the more modern stories. Combat can be engaging, even if it takes a while to get used to. The cast of characters is pretty alright, but it really depends upon what you are interested in, I know I personally got really attached to them. A few flaws to mention though would be the loot system that someone else pointed out, but also the way the side conversations are handled. You can only view the side interactions with the characters when on a save point, and only the ones for the part of the story you are at. In other Tales game (a lot, not all), the side conversations with the characters happened anywhere in the world if you pressed the right button. \n\n\nFairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force: This title mostly comes down to if you enjoy Idea Factory and Compile Heart\'s games and writing. The gameplay is pretty similar across all their titles truth be told.If you have played the orginal Fairy Fencer then Advent Dark adds a lot of new content to the game, mostly around the final chapter, but is largely the same game as the orginal. When it comes to Idea Factories and Compile Heart\'s RPGs, the stories are largely meant to be taken as a comedy then fully serious. Then again, I have loved a lot of the titles from the company, so I may be biased for them, but they never fail to make me laugh in that typical anime type style. If you ever played any of the Neptunia games then you know what you are getting into with Fairy Fencer. \n\nDemon Gaze 2: Demon Gaze 2, although I have never played the second one I have played the first. The titles tend to be fairly strightforward plot wise and stick to a first person dungeon crawling experance. Most first person dungeon crawlers where you build your party tend to be fairly hard until you learn the mechanics, even after learning the mechanics they can be pain. Personally, I love them. With the first Demon gaze there was a large spike in difficulty after the 4th or 5th dungeon boss where it went from ""Oh, this seems new dungeon crawler friendly"" to ""This is now on the difficulty of a lot of other Dungeon crawlers I\'ve played."" That said, these types of games are fun to pick up and play. Saddly I can not comment much on Demon Gaze 2 as a whole though, only that it is on my list to be getting soon as I love this genre of gaming. \n\nDisgaea 5: Like all Disgaea games, is a timesink. If you have played the other titles in the series before then you largely know what you are into. The series itself is a JRPG with a heavy focus upon comedy, so a lot of really wacky stuff does happen. D5 is no exception. The titles tend to have a lot of grinding to them, but really for most of them you can reach the end of the game after maybe 60 hours (Typical of most RPGs I find), but if you want to 100% the game then you might be at it for a really long time as the post games tend to be insane and long with the final hidden bosses of the games normally requiring to reincarnate from level 9999 a few times in order to beat. (Luckily by end game there are a lot of ways to level fast.) Personally I would enjoy the series as it is one that you can pick up, play a level and then put back down when needed and each level tends to only be about 10-15 minutes or less depending. \n\n\nArcania the complete tale: As the other guy said, avoid. The game was a buggy, glitchy mess and it would be better to get the orginal Gothic titles on PC. They came out many years ago and only use the keyboard really to play, but have great writing over all. So they can largely play on any potato. \n\n\nAs for personal suggestions, I\'m limited by not knowing what systems you do have. There are a ton of really great JRPGs on the Vita and PS3 though that I could recommend for instance that never made it to the PS4. Mostly Tales titles or first person Dungeon Crawlers. If you enjoy titles like Monster Hunter (Technically not an RPG, I know), I would recommend the Toukiden  series of games as well, which can be found on the PS4. They are largely fantastic gameplay wise and the story is fairly simple. To me the biggest draw to them was that all the monsters use Japanese folk lore and Japanese history as the backdrop for the game. As someone who loves religion, history and Folk Lore it blew me away seeing all the references and creatures. ', 'Dark Cloud 2', ""I use the website backloggery. Have added all my games and wishlist and it have a fortune cookie option that randomly picks a game for me to play from my list. It has an array of filters to avoid it picking out a game I have already played or a game I have played but not finished. If it chooses a game where I haven't played the previous title/s in a series then I just play that game instead.\n\nYes it takes a while to add everything you have if you have a big library but once it's done it's great."", 'Final Fantasy IX is a classic and the best game on that list', ""The Surge is a pretty neat twist on the Souls formula. It has really tough normal enemies and fun, fluid combat, but its environmental design could be much better. I'd recommend skipping it if you haven't already played through all Souls games. It's a good game, but unfortunately it's inferior to the games that inspired it.\n\nBound By Flame is like a mediocre version of The Witcher. I'd say it's not worth playing with so many better games out there. \n\nFairy Fencer F is grating from the very little I played. I couldn't get past its intro with how awful the writing was, so maybe I'm not a good judge of it, but... ugh.\n\nArcania is a bad sequel to Gothic. Don't play Arcania. Play Gothic 1&amp;2 or Elex, the decent sci-fi spiritual successor to Gothic. Seriously, if you haven't played Gothic 2: Night of the Raven, do it now. It's brilliant and you don't need to play G1 to understand it.\n\nZestiria is alright. It's a pretty straightforward JRPG that's weighted down by unnecessarily complex subsystems. For example, its loot system is probably the most complex system of its kind I've seen. I got halfway through the game and still didn't know how it works or why it's even there. The best thing about Zestiria is probably its soundtrack, which carried a lot of the game for me. The prequel Berseria streamlines a lot of the systems and is a way better game IMO.\n\nDanganronpa is a really fun puzzle VN. It's in no way a RPG, though.\n\nAs far as recommending great games that every fan of RPGs hasn't heard about a thousand times already, I'd mention Wizardry 8, Gothic 1&amp;2, Planescape Torment, Expeditions: Conquistador, Divine Divinity and Temple of Elemental Evil."", ""FF9 is the best game on that list. It's amazing, and although it's dated it has aged better than the other PSX era Final Fantasy games.\n\nDisgaea 5 is very good. The cast isn't as good as Disgaea 4, but it's still a really fun story. The postgame is, as always, excellent too.\n\nRogue Galaxy is a good JRPG. I can't remember much of it though so can't give details.\n\nIf Dark Cloud 2 and Dark Chronicles are the same game then that's very good too. Far, far better than Dark Cloud 1. I can't couch for how well it has aged though.\n\nStar Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness is disappointing. I didn't get very far. I might give it another chance though. It just feels unpolished. It's not always clear who is speaking, NPC models have no substance (you just walk right through them), and it lacks the sense of scope that previous Star Ocean games had.\n\nEdit: other games you might want to look into: Tales of Berseria, Trails in the Sky (start with FC), and Final Fantasy X.""]"

They hope to catch a lot of players who don\'t care about spending additional 100 bucks on a game. Players who want to feel powerful in a single player game. They also made it so that you won\'t have enough XP to go on if you only do main quest. But the game itself is full of sidequests and activities and I enjoy doing them.\n\n&gt;I can imagine some people who want to play the game to completion but don\'t actually enjoy playing it - they can get those upgrades and rush through the main quest. But those people probably have some, ahem, specific mindset and it\'s very greedy indeed for Ubisoft to sell them cheatcodes instead of adding option like ""Make main quest enemies scale down to my level"" or something for ultra-easy mode or something. Unless you\'re one of those people you can enjoy the game.\n\nI had fun doing all the optional stuff. In the starting area I did everything that was possible and it didn\'t feel like work, it felt like exploration and challenge. When you get to an open world there\'s a quest generator involved - those quests are time limited and they\'re simple, they\'re what you do on your way somewhere, often something like ""kill 5 Athenian soldiers"" or ""kill 5 wolves"", you just get that quest and it completes itself later. I suspect that you\'re supposed to have right level if you do every main and sidequest you encounter and nothing else, but you might wader off just because it might be fun, or just because you want to deal with specific mercenary, or million other reasons.\n\nSo it didn\'t feel like grind to me yet.

It really does feel like you're exploring Ancient Greece and I'm such a sucker for the setting.\n\nIt definitely feels grindy, but in a good way for me. I'm not super far into the game, but the main story quests are usually a higher level than I am when I get them.

There were some neat things at the start where your actions determined a bit of the plot line, but about 10% into the game that mechanic seemed to disappear, which was really disappointing. Sure it was an alright game, but it just seemed seriously overrated. Combat system seems pretty lacking and the time travel could be way more interesting - it often feels like I'm on a boring fetch quest just through time.\n\nProbably because I was playing a DS remake I haven't even really finished the game. They added tons of bonus dungeons before endgame that are super boring. I got dogged down in these (not realizing they were bonus) and lost the desire to finish.

Then it turns into a more generic RPG than most medieval inspired RPGs are.  What was the point of teasing people with the space theme?  I also found the combat to be kind of boring.  Yeah, it was trying to do a ton of new stuff, but it didn\'t click with me.\n\nTales of Symphonia - I\'ve tried playing it three times.  I\'m someone who tries not to judge games based on graphics.  Heck, I\'m able to play old Dragon Quest and Phantasy Star games just fine.  But the movement and combat in this game is just too unpolished for me to get used to.  I feel like there\'s no point in it even being an ARPG other than keeping up with the series.  Then you have so much superfluous dialogue that doesn\'t improve the characters or story.  It also doesn\'t help that I can recognize the tropes coming a mile away.\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics - People will really jump on me for this one, but I feel like its every trope from every previous FF game I don\'t like, wrapped into one story.  Constant betrayals, the evil church, you\'re hated for being royalty but also not royal enough, plot twists shoved in everywhere, etc.  I also feel there\'s major issues with the tactical system.  There\'s things this game does that even SNES Fire Emblem games did better.  I liked the job system, but that\'s about it.  And I can get that job system in FFIII without all these story/tactical problems.\n\nSkyrim - Don\'t think there\'s more that needs to be said.  Its the only Elder Scrolls game I\'ve played, but literally every single thing in the game makes me think ""they could have polished this feature a little more and it would be good.""

I almost don't consider their games RPGs, just huge sandboxes, like some virtual version of Lego Technic (while minecraft is the classic lego).  \n\n\nAlso most JRPGs which are just generic iterations of the same thing that was created by squaresoft 10 years ago."", ""I know I'm going to get slammed for this, but I'll say it: Final Fantasy VI.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think it's an excellent game, but it ranks among my least favorite Final Fantasy games. There are many other games in the series that I would much rather play.\n\nHere are my issues with it:\n\n* The leveling system is unnecessarily complicated. You don't get stat boosts unless you have an Esper equipped. This permanently penalizes you for not leveling with the right Esper. I know that the stat boosts aren't necessary for the game, but I would rather have a normal leveling system that didn't require so much micromanagement.\n* Learning magic is a slow process. It takes a long time to learn the good spells, and since you'll need multiple magic users for the final dungeon, you'll have to do a lot of grinding to get there. This is made worse by...\n* Too many playable characters. I'm conflicted about this one because from a story perspective, all the characters are awesome. From a gameplay perspective, it demands way too much grinding. Between grinding for magic and grinding for levels, I spent too much time grinding and not enough playing through the game.\n* The story falls apart in the World of Ruin. I know a lot of people like the non-linear nature of the World of Ruin, but I didn't. You'll notice that characters don't interact with one another as much once you reach it. Since there's no way to know who will be in your party, there weren't many interactions beyond the characters specifically relevant to that mission. It's one thing that annoyed me because seeing how all these different personalities deal with one another was one of my favorite things about Final Fantasy IV and the first half of Final Fantasy VI.\n\nI find it interesting that Final Fantasy VI wasn't as acclaimed when it first came out. I remember when it was released for the Super NES, and the reviews called it a weaker follow-up to Final Fantasy IV (which was my feeling as well). It didn't start to see the love it has today until Final Fantasy Anthology came out for the PlayStation and all the people where introduced to the series through Final Fantasy VII were finally able to play it.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying it's bad. I really do love the game, but out of the main series, I only rank it above II and VIII."", ""I'm not playing JRPGs so besides them...\n\nThe first Dragon Age. Was SO BORING to me. Never tried the following parts."", 'How dare you talk shit about Persona 5!', ""Dark Souls - going through the same area over and over and over and over until you don't die just wasn't fun for me."", '1. Oblivion. Everything Oblivion does better than Skyrim, Morrowind does better than Oblivion. Everything Oblivion does better than Morrowind, Skyrim does better than Oblivion. The one thing it has going for it is the first half of the Dark Brotherhood questline.\n\n\n2. Final Fantasy. From 6 on it\'s very much a one-track franchise. The combat is usually mediocre and kinda shallow, the games tend to be very linear and what little exploration they have is pretty limited compared to most of their contemporaries, and their ""side quests"" normally just amount to dicking around with mini games. FF is about one thing and one thing only, and that\'s about using writing, music, and cinematics to tell a grand, sweeping story. And that wouldn\'t be a problem, different games have different focuses and that\'s fine. Not every RPG should be an open world experience or focused on a deep and rewarding tactical combat system. Except the cinematics aren\'t impressive anymore and the older I get, the more I cringe at the writing, so it doesn\'t even deliver at that anymore.', 'Hoo Boy, Here we go! The ENTIRE Final Fantasy Franchise, with very few exceptions.  \n\n\nIve tried so many times in past years, I did, Finally with 13 I couldnt anymore and just completely gave up on the series. Ive tried every direct franchise title excluding the mmo\'s and 15. and of those I only found 12 to be enjoyable back when I played it on the ps2 (havent tried the ps4 remaster), The Side games I enjoyed were crystal chronicles due to couch co-op nostalgia, world of final fantasy because the mons are adorbs, and, oddly enough 10-2, and I cant remember why I liked 10-2 havent picked it up again in years, I think it was it was more ""girl-power"" in a sense.  \n\n\nAnyways. The majority of the series is filled with idiotic deus ex machina, taken waaaaay too seriously (The first game ends with it, and idiotic shit like that continues through the series), when its dumb. Itd be better if they joked about it,but its always played straight and seriously as if its the norm for some random god to decide to destroy the world on a whim when you were trying to stop the villain that was built up to this point.   \nAdd on the need to read pages of tutorials for basic aspects of any entry of the series due to the developers changing the battle system almost from the ground up, as well as leveling system, or magic system or whatever they decided to \'reinvent\' this entry on a damn whim. The only consistency in gameplay wise is protag\'s I dont care about, shitty writing and reasoning for the villain being a villain, and the fact that they\'re defineable as rpg\'s (note I dont dislike changes in battle mechanics between series entries of games in general, theres just so little consistency between any entries, that every one feels like the developers were taking turns on trying out Their new idea for how to get a damn magic spell in-game).  \n\n\nThe games just arent good, the ost is even \'meh\' to me, yeah I know the jingle for winning a battle, doesnt mean its good. Tbh the only good thing I really enjoy from final fantasy as a whole is the artwork  Yoshitaka Amano did for the series.  \n\n\nI wanted so hard back about half a decade ago to like this series.....

We've all seen western European medieval settings, eastern settings, middle-eastern architecture, modern settings, sci-fi settings, etc. FFX is the only one inspired by Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander architecture, culture, and dress. It also helps that I simply love turn-based combat that doesn't rush you (the last Final Fantasy with traditional turn-based combat), the fleshed out cast of characters, the overall lore of the world, and the plot.

This isn't just Fallout or The Walking Dead, this is a world where humans are all but extinct, with only a few supposedly living in self-imposed exile on the moon, while the Earth has been reclaimed by plant life. The only sentient life forms on the planet are human-built androids carrying on an endless war against machines of alien origin.

***

*The year is 438 AC.* 

*Eighteen long years have passed since the death of the Black Queen, Visaera I Targaryen, whose Valyrian steel grip upon the kingdoms was without precedent in the ever-turning pages of history. Since then, the son who succeeded her, Rhaegar II Targaryen, has come and gone. His was an embittered, embattled reign that threatened the legacy of all whom had come before. In his place rules Aegon Targaryen, Seventh of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm. Yet, he is not the only power in this vast realm, nor is he the sole lodestone of influence within his own royal court. Standing by his side is not one, but two sisters, two queens, equally divided in both pursuit and ambition.*

*In the Seven Kingdoms, the lords yet rebuild from the unity shattered during that tumultuous time. Yet even as the great families set about to the mending of old wounds, the rise of a great hegemony has drawn many an eye to the trading lanes of the Narrow Sea.The Triarchy, despite its many bouts of infighting and even transformation, has endured for more than twenty years. Its power has grown, and its influence expanded tenfold after the Accord of 437 A.C. Such power has a price, for the contempt and alarm it breeds. Sleeping giants stir to the north and the south as both the Sealord of Braavos, and Triarchs of Volantis ready themselves of what may yet come.*

*The Seven Kingdoms are on the precipice of war yet again, but the questions remains. . . Does it come from without or within?*

My friends passion for games and the industry is truly wondrous but you don't have to take my word for it. You can see and read it yourself.

rpg_gamers,t3_9lqk5i,"A lot of talk about Dragon Quest with XI, how do I make up for lost time??I've been playing RPGs, ARPGs, WRPGs/CRPGs, and JRPGs since the mid 90s. Started with FFII. I have not played, or even seen anyone play, any Dragon Quest title ever. I don't know how this happened, trust me. With all the talk recently i thought maybe i should go back and give one a chance. So where to begin?

I do have a 3DS, so I know some of them, if not most, will be available there. I also have a PS3 &amp; 4, gamecube, &amp; wii.

Its not so much what titles are there in what order, I have google I can find that out myself. The bigger question is, are any skippable? 

Did they try a new mechanic somewhere that ruined one of the titles. 

Do any stand appart like ""Halloween 3"" which has nothing to do with Michael Meyers, but is instead about witches or some bogus nonsense.

Or am I about to buy like 5-9 games?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9lqk5i/a_lot_of_talk_about_dragon_quest_with_xi_how_do_i/,"['Dragon Quest is a series that you can really jump in anywhere. 4/5/6 &amp; 1/2/3 are two ""trilogies,"" but they\'re definitely distant enough that you can play them whenever. \n\nDQ is the ""grand daddy"" of JRPGs, and stays pretty true to it\'s roots. It\'s very much a classic turn-based JRPG that has been polished up instead of heavily innovated on. \n\n&gt;Its not so much what titles are there in what order, I have google I can find that out myself. The bigger question is, are any skippable?\n\nI\'d say 2, and possibly 1 are the most skippable. 1 is where it all started, but you only get a single character. 2 is a bit rougher, you get more party members but the game is pretty ""old-school"" tough, and the large world can be difficult to navigate. I haven\'t played it myself but 6 apparently isn\'t as strong an entry either. \n\nI\'d say 8, 5, and 3 seem to be the biggest fan favorites, though not sure how 11 stacks up (I really enjoy it so far). I\'d personally recommend DQ8 on the 3DS as a starting point, it\'s generally great overall. Although you may or may not miss the voice acting playing older games. \n\nIf you end up just not liking the gameplay/combat of 8, or whichever title you choose, the DQ series probably isn\'t for you. The games generally just try to refine the style that they\'re in, instead of changing it up a whole lot. \n\n&gt;Did they try a new mechanic somewhere that ruined one of the titles.\n\nNot going to say ""ruined"" but 9 was built more as a coop game, so any companions you recruit end up not talking or playing any role in the story. 3 is like this as well, though. So if you end up enjoying the character interactions they might not be as strong entries. \n\n&gt;Do any stand appart like ""Halloween 3""...\n\nNot familiar with that particularly, but nah. When you\'re playing a DQ game you definitely know you\'re playing Dragon Quest, haha. They all feel pretty similar, in a good way. \n\nHopefully I didn\'t go too much off topic and gave you some insight. \n\n**tl;dr**\n\nI\'d say jump in wherever (8/5/3 fan favorites, 11 good too I\'d say) and if you end up liking the gameplay and general feel of the games you\'ll probably end up liking most of the rest. If you don\'t then maybe the series isn\'t for you.', 'I too am interested in this. Upvote.', ""Okay, I've played every single numbered non-MMO Dragon Quest, since seeing my father load up the original Dragon Warrior on the NES was basically my first memory of life.  I love the hell out of this series.\n\nBut I also acknowledge that many of them have rough edges.  The early days, especially. DQ 1 is... barebones. One character. One enemy per fight. Limited plot and gameplay.  Historically significant, especially in Japan, but not necessarily a 'fun' game nowadays.\n\nMy favorites from childhood? 3 and 5.  I feel like Rizyq had some pretty reasonable things to say in terms of what games were most beloved.  3 was the first game to allow you to create your own party and assign jobs (like many Final Fantasies), but this resulted in pretty much no character interaction or character-driven plot.  But the game was sooo, sooooooo much better than 1 and 2, which were both brutish and hard. I think 3 was where I fell in love with it.\n\n5 is, in my opinion, the excellent plot.  This one is very different from 3, being super character and plot focused, and being surprisingly deep and dark for a Dragon Quest (a series that is known for being tongue-in-cheek and lighthearted).\n\nFor modern accessibility, I will point straight at 8 and 11.  These are both very similar to each other in many good ways, and are both probably the most 'modern' feeling Dragon Quests (despite very, VERY clearly still feeling completely Dragon Questy).  Good battle systems, good plots, likable and amusing team members.  Personally, I feel that either of those two would be the ideal entry point, just because they give a good feel of the overall Dragon Quest theme and feel, and because they are very good and approachable Dragon Quests.\n\nThe only one to AVOID would be DQ X, not because it was bad, but because it was (at least originally) a Wii MMORPG that basically never left Japan. It's the only Dragon Quest that I can say nearly nothing about, although I assume an even *more* hardcore DQ fan would have just played on a Japanese server and learned Japanese or something.\n\nIn overall summary, I would say that if you want to play them all like a marathon, feel free. Just disregard 10, and acknowledge that the early days are rough and hard.  **Use the newest versions of games whenever possible**. The DS remake of 4, 5, and 6 are the best version. The 3DS version of 7 is the best version. The Japanese SNES remakes of 1-3 are probably the best versions. I'm not 100% sure with the 3DS vs. the PS2 version of 8, but I assume the 3DS version is probably much more obtainable and playable nowadays.\n\nIf you want to taste-test some of the best before you jump in the deep end?  8 (3DS) and 11 (PS4), followed by 3 (if you can) and 5 (DS, theoretically playable on the 3DS?)."", 'Search for Dragon Quest XI: the kotaku review on youtube\n\nJust go ahead and start with DQ11. Its the best title of the whole series.\n\nDont worry about playing older titles first and saving the best for last. Just go for the best. DQ11 is your best option', ""DQ2 is skippable. Maybe play a bit of DQ1 just to see where it all started, but there's no need to finish it. DQ3 is where the party really starts and a great entry point."", ""I think I've only played up to DQ 8 or 9. But out of the whole series, I'd say 4 is my personal favorite. There are just so many unique characters. The way the story lines overlap is great too. The final chapter is a bit odd with only being in control of 1 character (the rest are automated I believe) but that too is somewhat interesting. \n\nLike everyone else is mentioning, unless you really want to go all in 1 and 2 can probably be skipped. So 3 could be a good jumping in point.\n\nIf you like the early ones 4-6ish, I'd say Breath of Fire 1&amp;2 are very good companion games. I personally enjoy those even more than Dragon Quest games, which I do love."", 'Do what i do when i start a series.\n\n\nStart with 1 and work your way through,honestly better this way albeit time consuming.\n\n\n', 'I have a gameboy copy of dragon warrior 1 and 2. I remember playing a little bit of both and they are extremely tough. I never gave 8 much of a chance on ps2 so I tried it again on the DS. I quit maybe 33-50% though. It’s way too cut and dry.\n\n11 looks super tempting maybe I’ll try it after Octopath traveler on pc or PS4....']"

rpg_gamers,t3_9lm0s6,"In a DnD Mood and Trying to Figure Out a Game to Try!Good morning all!

So I find myself in a high-fantasy/DnD mood recently. It's been many years since I've sat down to the table and actually played a game of DnD but I figured I could turn to the realm of video games to help scratch this itch!

I was looking at **Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition**, **Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition**, and **Neverwinter Nights 2**. I'm looking at these three specifically as my wife has all 3 currently on the PC. I've never played any of these games before or any CRPG, for that matter, outside of Divinity Original Sin 1 and 2. 

My question is: **Which one of the abovementioned games would be best for someone easing back into the realm of DnD?** I wasn't sure if Baldur's Gate 2 EE might be more accessible than the first game, for example. But at the same time story is important to me and I'm scared I may miss out if I jump into the sequel first? Neverwinter Nights is a little different as we *only* own the sequel.

You could always try out the OC and move into MotB if you like it.\n\nThat said, Baldur's Gate is a glorious game as well.

That said, the original starts you off straight at level 1 in 2nd edition AD&amp;D, which is not very forgiving of mistakes or bad luck on dice rolls.\n\nIf you want a little less emphasis on story, the Icewind Dale games offer a more low-key dungeon romp.\n\nTemple of Elemental Evil uses the far less archaic 3rd Edition ruleset, and is exactly an entry-level campaign module adapted into a CRPG.

Turn-based rather than real time with pause.\n\nIf story/writing is your main attraction, Planescape: Torment is the greatest piece of writing ever set down in a video game.

rpg_gamers,t3_9kh7f2,"Kingdom Come Deliverance: A review and my overall thoughts 

So I've played about 60 hours of this game now and felt it finally was time to write a review, so here's a bit of a summary. The full review I have put up on my blog, but I know that I annoyed people when I did just that so this time I'm making a longer post, then I'll put up the link at the end.

What an experience it is so far.  Now, I’m fully aware of the games problems with bugs and glitches. For many, it’s still broken, and I thank the deepest tentacles of Lovecraft Cthulhu that I don’t have this on console. I started playing Kingdom Come Deliverance in April, and I’ve avoided most of the botched bugs and crashes that others have suffered.

Now, I’ve had some problems. Some texture pop-in, a few visual bugs like NPCs merging like some weird Chimera experiment and some little things like that but nothing game-breaking. I’ve had a couple of scene crashes and one infinite loading screen, but thats honestly it, and every patch has improved the performance for me. In fact I’ve been pleasantly surprised how well the game runs for me. My laptop isn’t great but loading times have been nice and quick (My SSD goes a long way of course, and I highly recommend one for everybody) and FPS is generally good with playing about with the settings. I never expect to run high end games in max but then again, I don’t care about 4K and all that. I just want it to look good and run good. If you don't have a particularly high-end system, this game might run better then you think, just don't expect to run it in max settings.

I haven’t played such an immersive, enjoyable 1st person game in a long time. The world-building is good but not overly saturated, it’s well researched, the systems in the game are excellent, and I adore Henry as a player character. He’s a burly, blacksmith’s son who likes drinking and fighting, is terrible at first with a sword, and the voice acting I really dug. There is some amazing voice acting in the game, sprinkled with some. . .lesser voice acting. I’ll go into more detail with this in general.

I love most of the systems, like the pickpocketing, rich combat system and the alchemy, but I do feel there’s…something missing. I want more, but although there are a lot of random events said, I’ve come across so few that the world, beautiful as it may be, can seem a bit barren at times. I love travelling in the world regardless, and although the game feels like it still suffers from Open World RPG syndrome, at this point in the game this isn’t a problem. It’s not a chore, and I enjoy that.

I also have to talk about the bugs, not so much for me but for those who’ve struggled with unplayable messes. Yes, I know every game has bugs, and I hate the fact that people blast this game for it while giving the likes of Bethesda and CD Projekt Red a pass for everything. If anything this game is far more polished then Skyrim.

On the other hand, why do we has a whole allow this? Games should be in the best nick possible on release, and being made to wait ages for simple problems to be fixed is frankly insulting. This is more for the gaming market on principle rather then just Warhorse.

Kingdom Come Deliverance took a long time to come out, and it’s taking a long time to fix. Consoles really have it rough and there are still niggling issues. But do I recommend it? Oh my days, yes.

The game doesn’t hold your hand and combat can be rough but I haven’t played an RPG like this in quite some time. It’s quite taken my breath away at times, the story and characters on the whole are pretty good and it’s just an overall fun experience. Even better, Warhorse is continuing to support it with future content and I can’t wait for all the Workshop mods in the future. I will err on the side of caution and say this isn’t for everyone. Do **not** come into this expecting something like Skyrim or Witcher 3. It has its jank and has its quirks, but it’s one of the best experiences you can ask for – if you’re forgiving of some bugs. If you’re a performance micro-manager, I would wait for a little longer, and I would definitely recommend PC over console if I had a choice.

**Total Rating: 8/10. It’s not perfect but in a market over-saturated with games that take no risks, this is a refreshing experience. ""Euro-Jank"" for certain but don’t let that get you down. This is one real diamond in the rough, and a potential GOTY for me.**

I'm also interested in your thoughts on it: Did you like it? Did its broken launch turn you off? Thoughts on the combat system?

I go in considerably more detail here: [https://thousandscarsblog.wordpress.com/2018/10/01/kingdom-come-deliverance-review/](https://thousandscarsblog.wordpress.com/2018/10/01/kingdom-come-deliverance-review/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9kh7f2/kingdom_come_deliverance_a_review_and_my_overall/,"[""It was only because the game was so amazing that I choked down the bugs. In my first playthrough I had almost no trouble. Some janky physics here, walking on air there, using the alchemy bellows raising me 10 pixels into the air on every use (which I utilized to get an amazing aerial screenshot). Nothing too bad really it was great.\n\nBut when I tried to start a new game, holy hell endless bugs. I had to do the beginning area 7 times before the fight and subsequent dream sequence didn't bug with either the swordsman not fighting back (and expectedly immortal). Or the dream sequence not progressing. Even the cart ride froze once. I just couldn't get through the seemingly now-endless tide of bugs.\n\nThat said, if you have an experience like I did on my first playthrough, the game is easily worth GOTY.

The Temple of Elemental Evil has the best D'n'D combat in a CRPG, they should have taken notes...\n\nI'll probably revisit this game in a year or so, after it's properly polished.

Then you have to constantly go from loading screen to loading screen.\n* Time limits, there are multiple time limit quests in the game that just frustrates you because you can't actually explore the world, you feel pressured to take care of the timed quests or its game over.  There are some big ones in each chapter. \n* Fatigue and rest mechanics, whoever thought this was a good idea should have their head examined.  It is mind numbling dull and frustrating have to stop every short distance because your fatigued and are forced to rest.

B) I will probably never make a full game
C) I have no other 3ds users interested in RPGs to share my games with, kinda rendering any project as useless.

rpg_gamers,t3_9jhdd4,"The Only Flaw: The SystemAs I play through all these CRPGs over the decades, one thing jumps out at me. I love the stories, characters, settings, and all the art that goes into them. But there's one thing I always end up hating: the RPG system they're built upon. They work great for tabletop games, but translating them into CRPGs is always the weak point of these games!

So many of these D&amp;D-style games would be absolutely perfect were it not for the swingy-ness of the d20. The Shadowrun games would be amazing if they would have built their own RPG system instead of trying to translate the source material system, which is legendary for being among the worst in tabletop RPG history. Even more modern games like Pillars of Eternity and Torment: ToN suffer from this affliction.

I understand most of these games are relying on RPG system name recognition as part of their marketing strategy, but PoE can't use that excuse. It's such a good game, but the core mechanics are just 3rd Edition D&amp;D beaten over the head with a thesaurus. It would have been so much better if they'd just built a new system, one more suited for the CRPG experience!

To prove my point, I look to my absolute favorite CRPGs to date: Tyranny and Wasteland. They've got all the great stuff from those other games - interesting characters, epic storyline, wonderful visuals - but they built new RPG systems from the ground up and it totally paid off!

It was a RPG like Baldur's gate, Icewind Dale or Nox, with isometric view and a similar render (2d or 3d can't remember, pixels everywhere).

I had a magic system where you created yours spells by combining elements in a grimoire, a little bit like Magicka or Mages of Mystralia nowadays.

I played it around 1999/2004 can't remember correctly, i was 8-13ish ...

I can't find it nowadays ... It's not Baldur's Gate, not Icewind Dale, not Neverwinternight, not Dungeon Siege, not Might &amp; Magic, not Sacred ... (i played them as a child.)

For a long time i thought it was Pool of radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor but i never found the spell system i remembered ... i remember a game where if you put just a fire element, you cast a fireball, if you put enough fire element in the spell you could make fire rain from the sky, if you had moon element to fire you could make rain meteors etc ...

SO. I'm going toward the Internet and the power of reddit to see if someone can remember a game from the mid to late 90s from a vague description ...

Basically, it felt for me like a very pale version of BG2/MOTB, with an excessive amount of content that tries to make up for quality. I'm perfectly fine with long reading sequences, but in PoE they were simply forced. Battle mechanics felt old, story didn't draw me in, characters were not really memorable, etc. On top of all, those 4th wall-breaking mind reading sequences, which basically made you ignore all npcs who had a weird name. Might worth mentioning that I did  finish the game despite all.

(those are the gold plated NPCs that exist for no reason but to have their fanfic read).  The NPC conversations are also much more reasonably-sized.  IE you won\'t run into dreadfully overwritten characters like Grieving Mother or Durance.\n\nAside from that, Deadfire is pretty much more of the same.

The switch to full VA has cut down on dialogue bloat and the character creation and mechanics are just tremendous fun, particularly with multi classing. \n\nI would say overall the story is better but the main quest is short and the characters are still a bit lifeless for me.

rpg_gamers,t3_9j3hqh,"Pillars of Eternity: Deadfire or Pathfinder: Kingmaker?Greetings fellow RPG lovers! I just found this sub and thought this would be a good place to get some input on the two above games. Firstly, a little about me:

I've been playing D&amp;D for about 15 years now and the Pathfinder tabletop game is fantastic and I've had a lot of fun playing and running games. I'm also a huge fan of 3.5 edition.

On the other hand I've played the first Pillars of Eternity and really liked the story and the animations. As well as the overall design of the game.

My current dilemma is this: which one should I buy? PoeD is currently on sale but kingmaker has had my interest since I first learned about it 2 years ago. What's everyone's compare and contrast? Anyone okay Kingmaker yet?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9j3hqh/pillars_of_eternity_deadfire_or_pathfinder/,"['Codex has a thread on kingmaker. Consensus there is some bugs, average story, and pretty hard combat.', 'Both if you can, and right now PoE2, meanwhile devs polish and fix Pathfinder you can get it later. I feel are good times for cRPG fans. We have two good series in competition.', ""I haven't played Kingmaker yet, but I can personally vouch for Deadfire being excellent. It really scratched the itch in a way that the Divinity series and the first PoE couldn't (though I like those too). \n\nI loved that it was set in a non-traditional setting for fantasy games. How they interpreted the island/tropical environments and culture into the PoE world was really interesting to me. It can feel a little slow at times if you spend too much time exploring, but the main quest kept me engaged the whole time. "", ""My personal thoughts, owning &amp; playing both:  \n  \n1 - I always like waiting for patches to play games, so if you had to play one now, maybe lean toward POE2 - all the patches and expacs have only made it better, and surely future kingmaker patches will make that better, too.  \n  \n2 - I like to support new studios doing things I like, and early sales at full price are a major thing for them to succeed, so maybe lean toward Kingmaker to show that support \n  \n3 - I really enjoy pathfinder rules IRL, so a game of it is cool, too. so I lean toward Kingmaker; even though POE2 rules are cool as well, I just really like the d20pfsrd and anything based off of it  \n  \n4 - POE2 lets you fast forward time when your people are running around; kingmaker is just one normal speed. So that's a heavy lean toward POE2; you don't realize how much you miss fast-walking across a peaceful town until you cannot.    \n  \n5 - POE2 is probably a little more polished than Kingmaker right now, just my judgment of only a handful of hours of kingmaker played so far.   \n  \n6 - ultimately it's up to you but hopefully my meandering babbling helped you consider the choice more"", ""Wonderful time to be alive with so many series CRPG series doing so well. The Divinity series, The PoE series, the Wasteland series now Pathfinder hopefully becomes a regular series, and Tyranny was a great little one off.

I also don't play tabletop rpgs but here's my first impression for what it's worth.\n\n Story and setting seem to be very boring, didn't pique my interest at all. The same can be said for companions i've met, they are very generic. Writing is whatever i guess, i don't like it but i'm not a good judge of writing. Voice acting is mostly okay but can be terrible at times. Encounters early on is very difficult and inconsistent, at least for me. Combat also seems too much luck based. Early on a crit can win or lose you a fight. I'm sure it'll get better as i gain levels. The amount of classes/races and other customization options you get for your character are great. Character creation menu is the best i've seen. Animations are pretty bad, but game looks good overall if a bit too cartoony. Music is awesome (Reminds me of music from Dragon Age: Origins). Resting is annoying, it was cool at first but gets old really fast (I really hate having to rest to prepare spells). I haven't encountered any serious bugs but it seems a lot of people are having problems with their saves (saves getting deleted, not loading etc.). One of my biggest issues is that the game is terrible at giving you information. I really liked how you could hover over enemies in Deadfire and see the buffs, afflictions, damage reduction and saves they have. Bestiary was actually really useful too. In Kingmaker i feel like trial and error is the only way to figure out enemies and mechanics unless you're already experienced with them from the tabletop game. Constant reloading really takes away from the game, in my opinion. Maybe i am shit at the game and should stick to story mode but i don't remember getting wiped this much in any other crpg i've played.\n\nI would grab Deadfire and wait for reviews -from people that have actually completed the game- and a couple of patches for Kingmaker if i were you."", 'Pathfinder looks very very complicated ', 'I JUST got Kingmaker and have been pleasantly surprised.

I think that the beginning of the game should give you a stimuli that make sense for almost any type of character - and if it\'s an open world game then it should also explain why you *wouldn\'t* follow the main story.. E.g. I like Fallout New Vegas more than Fallout 4 and Fallout 4 more than Fallout 3. But I think that Fallout 3 has the best beginning.\n\n- Fallout 3 explains why you know nothing about the world but still have any skill that might be useful. It has a main quest (find Dad) that makes sense for any type of character. You can also easily explain why a hero might hesitate with this quest - it\'s not like Dad is helpless or in immediate danger.\n\n- Fallout 4 does similar stuff but fails in some regard. Many parts of the world are what our hero would have seen before the apocalypse but he never comments on that. A bigger problem would be his inability to talk about his child without being hysterical combined with the fact that you can postpone that quest indefinitely. It could have been solved by dialogue options like ""I don\'t think my son is even alive"" or ""For all I know he was taken away a hundred years ago"" or at least quickly establishing that the son is in Institute and safe so a hero can decide to gather resources and prepare for what comes.\n\n- Fallout New Vegas gives you as a player a good reason to resolve the mystery of the chip and follow the murders... But let\'s be honest, it takes a very special kind of person to follow someone who shot you in the head and looks like a big mafia man. So it doesn\'t support most kinds of characters you\'d want to roleplay. It also provides a sliding scale of what your character knows or doesn\'t know. He can act as if he doesn\'t know what NCR or Legion is - or he can sometimes quote Latin, mention he was in some place 20 years ago and of course DLC expands on his past. I don\'t really like this approach because it doesn\'t feel like the character is your own. In Fallout 3 you know everything your character might know, and if some dialogue option mentions you character knowing who Abraham Lincoln was then you\'re confident that your character really knows it; when your character can talk in Latin you remember that in one of your previous dialogues you\'ve specifically chose an option that meant your character doesn\'t know anything about Roman culture.\n\n- Fallout 2 has an OK premise (save the village) and reinforces it with... visions... from... shaman. Ahem. But it doesn\'t explain why your character might know so much about the world, again. You can leave your village with advanced knowledge of energy weapons or hacking even though nothing like that existed in your village and the closest computer is in toxic caves far away.\n\nSo I like a premise of something like Chrono Trigger. You have a time to learn about the world and you meet some people. You might not be the one who jumps into adventure but you get involved because of other people or communities you know. Like Crono rushing to save the girl. I\'d include many JRPG beginnings there. By the time you start controlling the character the plot is well established and it doesn\'t make sense to stop. Tyranny from Obsidian is like that, Divinity Original Sin 2 and Skyrim are similar - you only gain sort of freedom some time after the game starts and now you know what to do with that freedom.', ""I don't want a prologue just start the game.""]"

I'm having a blast. I like that it is more flexible than Lone Wolf. I think that purchasing the individual books might be more than what I want to spend on the game.

I played this way back when I was a kid and was impressed with the ""mature"" storyline, but it has NOT aged well. There\'s a lot of sexual violence (both actual and threatened), most of it shown towards your protagonist. It\'s still the only D&amp;D campaign I\'ve ever seen that is so completely geared towards rogues, though, which I still like.\n2. Demonheart - Another NWN1 module, this is still extreme with its sexual violence but, IDK, it doesn\'t seem as bad by comparison to the previous one. It\'s primarily geared towards atmosphere and memorable characters, and both of these are done really really well.\n3. Elegia Eternum - Another NWN1 module, I actually completed it because it was so short. This is short but very sweet, highly recommend.\n4. Dragon Age: Origins - Started for the hundredth time with my favourite character (female city elf rogue).\n5. Pillars Of Eternity - I wanted to play PoE2 with both its new expansions with a new character, and I wanted to complete a full campaign in PoE1 again to import into it (I\'m sorta weird about these things, this is why I\'ve wasted so much time on the whole Mass Effect trilogy). Problem is, even though I love playing as a chanter this playthrough, the first game is already extremely long, and I\'m playing the White March Pt. 1 expansion (which probably puts me at 60% completed).']"

rpg_gamers,t3_9i7u9k,"Are there any video games like Risen or Gothic?So I absolutely loved the mellow and relaxing atmosphere of Risen 1 and melancholic, somewhat depressing one in Gothic 1. I enjoyed just walking around the world, exploring, talking to NPCs moreso than combat. Sadly I can't think of a similiar game I haven't already played. I know there's the new Piranha Bytes' game - Elex, but it's setting and price (mostly the former, as I rarely enjoy sci-fi) are putting me off. Also I'm more interested in climate of those games, so they don't necesarily have to be RPG.

Fallout 3,New Vegas, Oblivion, Skyrim, Dragon Age: Origins, 2, Inquisition (Only liked Origins)

Not complicated enough? Should I scrap it and move on? Is it great on paper?\n\nLet me know what you think.', 'Maybe I am the wrong person to be helping as didn’t bother to take the time to go over it and just glossed over it, but noticed your post isn’t doing well and I should say what I think.      \n       \nOver all it looks fine but what is on paper doesn’t mean anything in the end.       \n       \nHow does the game play feel? When leveling up do I feel rewarded for the effort put in? How do the classes feel, are they meaningful? Although some of these can be found on paper, it is when experiencing the game that it matters and can be judged adequately.       \n        \nThen there is a whole lot stuff that isn’t covered and can only be experienced by playing the game that isn’t include in the overview you gave but equally if not more important. Is the story good, is the combat meaningful? Is the progression adequate or is it a grind, is the progression gated and dependent on certain conditions? Is the game too short?      \n       \nI think that reading over the design brief and refining it is important but only to those who are going to put in the effort to make something of it. Us, the general public are too lazy to do critical thinking over something intangible to them, hence the reason I think you post isn’t doing so well.      \n       \nMy advice would be, if you are happy with what you have come up with, forage ahead and make it work in game. Then play test it and see what works and what doesn’t and refine it. Then once you are happy, go through closed play tests and get feedback about it. Then once done with applying the final feedback onto the game, you can move onto publishing the game when you feel it is ready.      \n       \nSomething on paper can seem fine but can be a failure when put into play. For example: Having the stat Luck effecting loot drops may end up being a major factor in game play, forcing players to make the choice of absolutely needing to dump as much points into in order to have a more interesting and meaningful game (one hit KO’s on opponents and the best loot possible) for them.

Of course that’s where balancing comes in, which you said you’re starting to work on.\n\nMy other comment is that, for new players at least, I think the decision between dual-classing or expertise will be a confusing one. On the one hand it sounds like it might turn the game on it’s head, letting your assassin also be a frontline fighter, or your Shaper also be a healer. On the other hand, the cost of actions in combat may be too great so you don’t want to waste your soldier’s turn with an ability that is just a weaker version of what another character already possesses, making you just wish you had gone with an expertise/mastery. Again, this will all come down to actual application. \n\nLike I said, you’ve got a good framework, and the notes you’ve put up on your system are nearly all-encompassing. I wish you good luck on your journey.', ""While I agree with what everyone has said here, I think one thing that needs to be kept in mind when doing skills and leveling and overall appearance of customization: Is the ability for it to be simple for those that don't care to get fancy, and the ability for those that do care to take customization one or more steps further.\n\nIf it looks too complicated on the get-go, many will be turned off, some people have to be eased into the complicated parts.\n\nFor instance, thing about the first time a new player took a look at the skill board in FFX or even Path of Exile. It looks freaking daunting.\n\nEdit to add: I'm not saying complicated is bad, but there does need to be a certain level of easing into complicated mechanics and customization. I love complicated, but I have to care enough to get to the point of wanting to do it. There needs to be some kind of advantage to doing things complicated, but at the same time, not necessary to complete the game. "", 'Your document doesn\'t seem to talk about the formulas used to figure out if the attack was a hit or miss.

Cosmic Star Heroine does a really good job at this.\n\nImmunities and resistances are totally fine as long as I can\'t randomly miss because of a bad roll.\n\nThe gist of how CSH deals with status ailments (let\'s say the ""slow"" status for example) is that a monster will have a certain amount of ""slow HP"" and when you use your ""slow"" spell on it, it will reduce that HP. Once it hits 0 the enemy is affected by the status. This way your status ailment doesn\'t rely on random chance but instead you can wear an enemy down until it actually works.\n\nOther examples of modifying class formulas to remove randomness, if a thief monster uses the evade attack, instead of making them have an 80% chance to dodge a physical attack, make them only susceptible to AoE attacks.\n\nI agree with the others that you should prototype your system to see if it\'s any fun.

Some of the others are fine (Path of the Ethereal Fist and Frontline Juggernaut were my favorites), but like I said, I think some of the others could use a second pass.', ""I'd recommend you to go over stat names. E.g. it's strange that something that sounds like a skill, e.g. Defense and Evasion, is a stat, while something that sounds like an inherent quality of a person, e.g. Charisma, is a talent.\n\nI see that your stats are very specific. In most systems with stats they all do several things (or sometimes different things for different characters) which makes for interesting tradeoffs and connections. E.g. Strength usually raises carry weight but it also often affects melee damage so it means that pack mule characters are pushed to be fighters also. In your system only Agility and Luck look like traditional stats, e.g. you take Luck if you want to have crit chance based character but it would also mean that you get better occurances. Maybe it would make sense to unite some other stats into one so that you get that effect. Like unite Power and Defense into Body, or Accuracy and Evasion into Dexterity or something, and maybe add special skills for accuracy and evasion that will combine with Dexterity.""]"

Most people don\'t need to think about how beating up hookers in GTA reflects on their moral compass, it is a video game and they\'re not real.\n\nBesides in most RPGs being ""evil"" is rarely evil. Killing peasants, stealing, torture, betrayal, taking over the world, etc is literally how you do things in most RPG worlds. You\'re about as evil as most actual kings and governments were. Executing defeated enemies who would definitely kill you if they could is hardly hitler material.\n\nThe worlds most RPGs are set in aren\'t nice places, it is a wonder how heroes exist at all, at least in any perfect shade of gleaming white, they\'d all be very morally grey.', 'In anthropology, there\'s a concept of rituals of inversion. Occasions, holidays, or celebrations where we act the opposite of normal. These don\'t represent a desire to actually violate norms, but instead, reinforce the norms.

The Shadow is everything we're afraid to be, everything we don't want to be, everything we don't like about ourselves and not only the 'dark' side of our psyche. \nNonetheless, that's still a part of ourself, and if we want to work toward a 'complete', total being, we should try to integrate the Shadow with our conscious psyche. Everytime we avoid contact with her, we ignore or 'attack' her somehow, the Shadow always find a more destructive way to express herself. \n\nI see roleplaying evil characters as a way to meet our Shadow mid-way and let her express in a safe manner.

But what if you\'re an orc actively despised and hated by humans? Persecuted and killed knowing you live in a world where entire orc clans wiped out for the crime of simply existing? Then well, frankly speaking humans are the bad guys and it is fine to kill them. \n\nAnother point, The undead in skyrim. Lore says the undead have risen because of the greed of adventurers stealing their shit many of the undead died renowned hero\'s forgotten to time. Just because they\'ve risen again you an adventurer think it\'s perfectly acceptable to run them through with a sword or incinerate them with magic and steal all their shit. You aren\'t a hero even if your intentions were heroic. The path to heroism is paved with more blood than the path to evilness anyone can justify killing someone in the right context. ']"

rpg_gamers,t3_9h2tw4,"Looking for some inputSo I have been working on a JRPG for some time now, it helps to take your eyes off things for a bit and  I got an idea for a Space Opera RPG of some kind, I have three main plots I would like some feedback on. Really appreciate the feedback!

&amp;#x200B;

Humanity has developed the ability to “fold space.” The first live test of the ship named Armstrong Voyager involves a brave crew of men and woman who know full well that the chance of them not returning is high. But the final frontier awaits…

Plot 1:

Folding into the middle of a pre-civil war galaxy that is space faring but only due to high powered tech and close proximity planets the appearance of a foreign species that possesses FTL-like tech starts to tip the precarious balance of peace in this far away political eco system. Aside from that the crew of the Armstrong Voyager has found out that the original calculations that brought them here were completely incorrect and to get back will not only take new calculations but the Folder was too damaged to make such a far journey. So now stuck in an alien galaxy on the brink of war with broken tech and no idea how to get back home they now must find a way back…

Plot 2:

The advent of this tech brings the attention of the wider intergalactic community to Earth. The appearance of a foreign species that possesses FTL tech has every species vying for a new friend and political upperhand. The crew of the Armstrong Voyager is tasked with being diplomats to this new community, they are the best humanity has to offer after all. This den of vipers will take the best and bravest, and humanity has bravery in spades.

Plot 3:

An intergalactic civil war has started, bringing the attention of Earth’s scientists who’ve already been developing Folding technology. An alien leader (or diplomat) has crash landed on Earth forcing the governments hand- to harbour or assist this foreign life form and risk retribution of its enemies or release it to its enemies and risk retaliation of the aliens own people – thus thrusting humanity into this war kicking and screaming. The crew of the Armstrong Voyager now must defend the earth and humanity in this conflict or risk being wiped out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9h2tw4/looking_for_some_input/,"['The third one sounds the most intriguing to me personally.', 'Plot 3 is the most interesting and would likely be the easiest to scale-down to a small number of areas. If this is your first game, you’ll want to avoid getting too ambitious: try to keep a narrow focus. Third plot’s premise also lends itself better to a more character-driven work, as odds are the player-character would be involved a lot with the alien and earther officials.\n\nAnd if you don’t mind some unsought-advice, I don’t think your ship-name is very good. Either Armstrong or Voyager will work, but together they’re kind of too much. And “Voyager,” especially, is overplayed in SF (basically don’t use any hero ship names from Star Trek, yeah?), and it feels weird to put a noun after a person’s name like that. Just “Armstrong,” might be a good name, if a tad Americanocentric.  Alternatively you could toss another word in from of Voyager, like Solar or Celestial or Heavenly, depending on the general ambience you want to evoke. “Voyager” evokes a sense of isolation and the frontier; Armstrong evokes perseverance, determination, valor; Solar would suggest a kind of workmanlike quality, whereas something like celestial or heavenly would evoke a more magical, fantastical feeling.']"

I think before my group dissolved I ended up running around with a Riot Shield and a P90 to pretty good effect my friend though had a massive hardon for running around with a belt of grenades a rocket launcher and a sniper rifle. \n\nIt features a campaign mode that allows you and your friends to coop play through (occasionally a few story missions will require you to solo them but they're easy enough) and there is pvp as well if you want to go that route. \n\nThe game is F2P so it does have some of those trappings but all in all they're not to egregious but its still something to point out."", 'This is gonna sound like a weird rec at first but hear me out. It sounds like the multiplayer aspect is really important, so I\'m gonna recommend BLOOD BOWL! (specifically Blood Bowl 2 legendary edition).\n\nIf you aren\'t familiar, blood bowl is a tactical, turn-based strategy game where two teams face off for glory in an ultra-violent sport that kinda resembles football or rugby but is really just a thin excise for orcs and dwarves and what not to get on the field and murder each other. You develop and level your players like you would party members in an RPG with different ""positions"" having access to different skills. Each team represents a race or a faction, and every team has their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Some teams are built for ball handling and passing plays, some are built to run the ball, quite a few are built to simply murder the other team and then score when there isn\'t anyone left to stop them. Even if you don\'t care about sports the game really plays like tactical combat.\n\nTwo things though, one permadeath is definitely a thing in this game and while losing your star player isn\'t as bad as losing a top soldier in Xcom for example, it is worth mentioning since that\'s a turnoff for some people. Second, there is a lot of RNG in the game. The game is built around rolling dice to see if your actions worked or not. (For example, you\'re trying to make a pass, your guy has to roll a 2 or better to make the catch or else he drops the ball, this is very simpified and there are lots of skills that effect each action too). Adapting and overcoming is a huge part of the gameplay as your plans will often not go perfectly (neither will your opponents). Because of this and the fact that no two teams are the same, each blood bowl match is unique and you constantly have to think about your actions and plays instead of just figuring out the best strategy and then going on autopilot.\n\nAs far as multiplayer, there are tons of private leagues you can join but if you just want random matchmaking there\'s a structured season system with playoffs and cash prizes for winning a season.

You have a group of characters that you can level and change either the skills or equipment they can use. In battles you can pick who to send out to fight.

Its very basic in terms of graphics and animations but it is a strategy rpg of the kind I am looking for. There was a central town where you could talk and trade with other players and they had a board you could look at to except invites or make quests with other players. During battles you could have 6 people with you unless you were grouped with someone else in which case both of you only got to send out 3 members each and could only control yours. The maps arent that big so moving around and making decisions was important but more important was how you approached the enemies. ECOL Tactics wasnt perfect it had a ton of issues but the main idea behind the battling and level was very fft style. Hope this helps I will be looking at everyones recommendations and maybe I will find one I enjoy', ""Fell Seal, Disgaea series, the newer Shadowrun games, The Banner Saga, Phantom Doctrine, Into the Breach, Battle Brothers, Wartile, Warhammer 40k: Sanctus Reach, Xenonauts, Hard West, Ash of Gods.

Just go on Steam and browse Turn-Based Tactics for like 30 seconds.  \n  \nEdit: Nevermind I now see in your body comment you specified that you are looking for a multiplayer game like FFT. Next time, specify that in your title and you'll get a lot more accurate responses and honestly, I don't really think there are any multiplayer rpgs that have gameplay similar to FFT, unless you're willing to stretch the definition a bit.

rpg_gamers,t3_9guk79,"Will Vita still be a Viable Platform to make an Indie Game for in 2-3 years? (and other development questions)Hey All. Back with a question concerning game development. I’m getting closer to finishing a game design document for an interactive turn based RPG that I’m looking to submit to some indie game publishing companies. While I know for a fact I’d like to make the game for Mac and Windows (and possibly Linux) I’m also wondering if it would be reasonable to design the game for handheld consoles as well, specifically the PlayStation Vita.

I personally think that the Vita is a fantastic console, despite losing support from Sony, and I’m glad that developers are still working on games for the platform. However, I’m worried that by the time I’d be finished making my game in about 2-3 years or so, Vita support would be all but gone. I know that everyone is all out and about saying that Switch is the future of handhelds, but given their current practices in regards to their digital market, I’m personally a bit skeptical about the Switch’s future.

So if that’s the case, should I steer my development goals away from Handhelds and focus solely on PC development? And possibly Home Consoles like “XBox 2” and “PS5” as a stretch goal? Any thoughts you guys have on this would be most appreciated.

On a side note, there are a few other factors that I’d really appreciate some input from you guys on as well. I’m currently thinking of either making the game on RPG Maker MV or Unity, but not sure which would allow for Handheld portability, or if a whole other engine would be more ideal doe something like that. Also, I’m wondering which indie publishers I could pitch my game concept to, or if any of them turn me down, where I could look for team members to make the game with me. What do you guys think about any of these?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9guk79/will_vita_still_be_a_viable_platform_to_make_an/,"['If you want to do handhelds aim for phones.

rpg_gamers,t3_9giz88,"Achtung! Cthulhu Tactics New Gameplay Footage w/Developer CommentaryHey guys,  
You may have seen us post a few weeks ago about an upcoming turn-based tactical strategy game we're working on; Achtung! Cthulhu Tactics.

Set to release in 2018, challenge the horrifying reign of Nazi terror and battle an immortal evil in this raging Secret War across Europe. An untold darkness spreads deep beneath the Earth and throughout the Forest of Fear, the unknown lurks in the shadows and you must claim victory at any cost, because whilst Nazi factions terrorise these lands, they are not the darkest foe you face…

**Key Features**

* **Tactical Combat:** direct a squad of allied heroes in innovative turn-based ground battles.
* **Momentum System:** perform well in combat by racking up kills and executing critical hits to earn Momentum and turn the tide of battle in your favour.
* **Light vs Dark:** harness the power of the light to expose and suppress the spawn of Cthulhu hiding in wait in the oppressive darkness.
* **AP System:** every decision is important and the Action Point System gives you the flexibility to put as much emphasis into heavy combat or nimble movement as you like.
* **Psychological System:** witness too many horrors of war and watch as your unit's sanity begins to unravel mid-fight.
* **Build Your Team:** characters have unique skills that can be unlocked and levelled up in different ways, and weapons can be modified to give a variety of benefits. This lets you customise your squad to better vanquish Nazi scum.
* **Weird World War:** explore the Lovecraft-meets-WW2 universe of Achtung! Cthulhu like never before with Mythos-inspired enemies and a story-driven campaign handcrafted by John Houlihan which ties directly into the pen and paper roleplaying game narrative.

We've actually released some brand new gameplay footage along with a developer commentary from Tomas Rawlings, Design Director at Auroch Digital. You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJu_kOWFBqE&amp;t=6s)

You can add Achtung! Cthulhu Tactics to your Steam Wishlist right now by clicking [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/874460/Achtung_Cthulhu_Tactics/).

Players can touch enemies without taking damage. The battle begins only when a hostile action is being done by either the enemy or the player. Both enemies and players need to wait a certain amount of time before they can attack again. It's basically the ATB system of Chrono Trigger without choosing the enemy you attack via a menu. 

Secret of Mana does not require any particular skill in attacks, it's all been done by the press of a button or an action done from a menu. There are no combo actions like in Terranigma or Illusion of Gaia, and the angle of which you approach an enemy has no effect on the attack (unlike Zelda)

Then I started to get a little bored for a bit. Once I met the other main party character (not too far in) it became way more engaging and interesting to me. I think that it is a good game overall. It does the things it intends to do very well.

If so say why.,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9ftxbz/is_elex_worth_the_time_and_money/,"['I rather enjoyed my time with ELEX, but I was quite a fan of Piranhabytes games to begin with so I went in biased and knowing what to expect. \n\nIf you haven\'t played their stuff before, Piranhabytes are pretty much the kings of Eurojank. The mechanics and gameplay are a bit out there compared to most other things you will have played, experimental in ways that drift between great innovation and frustratingly outdated. And yes, sometimes those ideas are clumsily implemented too, but if there\'s one thing that describes Piranhabytes at their best its ""Greater than the sum of its parts"". \n\nSure the combat may be a bit clunky, the writing is a bit odd in places, and the progression systems live in a bizarre state of being simultenously too much and not enough info at the same time but somehow when you add everything up the whole experience totals up to a rather enjoyable and (if nothing else) unique experience. There really isn\'t any modern game that offers the experience ELEX does, and while it\'s no Gothic 2 or Risen I\'m hoping it heralds a return to form for Piranhabytes.\n\nAs for actual specific things I enjoyed about ELEX: \n\n* I rather like the levelling system. It\'s incredibly spread out and modular so you can really lever a great deal of control over your build which allows for a fair bit of variety in replays - especially since joining a faction dramatically changes your playstyle (and the story!) but you don\'t need to commit to that for a long while.\n\n* The progression - this is more a credit to Piranhabytes in general but the feeling of progressing from a weak nobody to the biggest badass in the world is second to none. Barely getting away with your life when you were a lvl 1 noob with a rusty sword is heart pounding, then when you return later as a magic wielding berserker who has all the might of Thor or an icy cold Borg like cyborg with devastating technology is incredibly satisfying. It\'s a *real* slow burn though and some people don\'t have the patience for it.\n\n* The World building. Again more Piranhabytes in general but the worlds they create are incredibly fun to get lost in and richly detailed with factions who have deep histories and long ideological conflicts. \n\n* The open world and the feeling of going anywhere and doing anything you want in any order. Some will probably dispute this as ELEX is the sort of game where you find out *fast* and often the hard way that you\'re somewhere you shouldn\'t be, but once you\'ve got a real grip on the game (second playthrough say) the freedom that knowledge gives you is fantastic and really opens the game up.', ""If you're a big Gothic fan, maybe."", ""For me it was worth it.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, it can be clunky and hard at times, it's exactly the same formula as all previous Gothic games, but I like this formula and I had fun with Elex."", ""Yes.

At least on a sale. Don't go in expecting Witcher quality or Skyrim quality. Their budget does show. However, I really enjoyed the exploration and feel of the world in the game.

We, Dark Crystal Games, want to share with everyone a wonderful news! We’ve just launched a Kickstarter campaign for Encased RPG! You can check out exclusive gifts for backers and more good stuff here:

r/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/darkcrystalgames/encased-old-school-isometic-turn-based-rpg?ref=nav_search&amp;result=project&amp;term=Encased%20

We have been hard at work on Encased for the past ten months. The game is currently in the pre-alpha stage, and the developers are already confident of the project’s completion. The goal of the crowdfunding campaign is to raise $100,000. Any revenue collected will be used to refine the game and expand the team. Pledges from fans will expand the main campaign and increase the number of locations available to explore.

We wait for your feedback about  Encased and Kickstarter campaign!

Another turn-based isometric RPG from Russia! I\'m in, backed! Almost every game I\'ve ever backed on KickStarter turned out to be good enough. I\'m hoping this streak will continue with ATOM, and now with Encased. What I\'m expecting:\n\n* *Quick* turn based combat - think about options to speed it up early! Make it possible to speed up animations, and maybe even give units orders in parallel, like in X-Com (order another unit to move while another is still running). Nothing is worse than combat where every turn takes several minutes just because of animations. Enemy animations should be paid special attention to - watching some shambler slowly crawl cross the screen for minute, wasting my previous play time, is intolerable.\n\n* Interesting combat - combat, more than any other part of the game, should be ""a series of interesting choices"", emphasis on ""interesting"", because if choices every turn are completely obvious, then it\'s really not good. Learn from X-Com, not from Wasteland, is what I\'m saying.\n\nI see that the companions are controlled by AI, Fallout-style. I\'m REALLY not sure this is a great idea - please consider testing it thoroughly and maybe reverting to the direct control. AI companions were source of many a story for Fallout players, but almost none of them were good ones, mostly ending with ""and then, when there was just one raider left, Sulik sprayed me with an SMG and I had to reload"".\n\nAnyway, I hope you succeed.

You hire from a HUGE array of mercenaries that all have personalities and interact with each other differently (some hate working with each other, some will go nuts if their favorite partner dies).\n\nThe tactical combat is on-point, with a lot of viable options of attack. Pick a somewhat-fortified building and just hunker down while the enemies run to you, sneak in at night-time and systematically/silently kill each enemy with a knife, set explosives and watch enemies walk into your traps.\n\nThere\'s a HUGE variety of character types.

Liberating the hospital gives you access to a.... well, hospital, so your injured mercenaries won\'t be out of combat as long.\n\nIt\'s the game after Final Fantasy Tactics that got me into tactical combat.

Deus Ex, Dishonored, Prey, Bioshock, sometimes Thief. If you're generous you can include games like Far Cry 2+. Or even modern Tomb Raider games.\n\nThe point is that you have inventory and some sort of character progression, just like in an RPG. You can also approach problems in a variety of ways. But the detailed world is the focus. It usually has more complex interacitons compared to RPGs, you often learn about levels and revisit them, you master your environment. Unlike RPGs those games usually allow you to use all tools with little limits. In a proper RPG different characters play differently (that's why people argue if Witcher 3 is really an RPG because Geralt always plays the same), but in immersive sim all playstyles are available to you. You might still be better at something with character progression system but generally when you see a problem you can always solve it in a variety of ways.\n\nIn, say, Divinity Original Sin 2 you'll need a very special character to be able to steal stuff or persuade character. You'll need special skills and spells to fight fire monsters, your character might be completely useless against them if he concentrates on fireballs and stuff, and will have to use costly consumables. Even in action RPG like Fallout 4 your powerful characters would be useless if he decides to use pistols on late game opponents - but if he has the right skills he may be deadly with said pistols. In System Shock 2 just as in other similar games everything is effective. Some things might be more effective depending on your skills or perks but you'll always be able to sneak or shoot. IIRC some weapons have skill requirements but those are not that big of a deal.\n\nSo I wouldn't call it an RPG.

You have classes of sorts (with the choices you make early on that define your character), stats (Strength,  Agility, Psi, etc.), skills (Tech, Maintain, Modify, etc.), Psionic Abilities and OS Upgrades, all of which greatly affect how you play the game (much more so than the minimal customization in something like Call of Duty), inventory and resource management, equipment (weapons, armor and implants), crafting (Research), basic puzzle solving and a fairly in-depth story (fleshed out by the logs).\n\nEither way, it is (still) well worth playing as you mentioned.

rpg_gamers,t3_9f3qbl,"Solo indie developer here with my second ever game - TapRPG2 - The Second one. Hey everyone. A year and a half ago I started making my first major project, [TapRPG - Homeland](https://store.steampowered.com/app/864480/TapRPG__Homeland/). The support, help, and feedback after that was released (Free on Android, cheap on iphone and Steam) was amazing.

I had some awesome people pick up homeland and do [Playthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVSsKUXtVBM). And people yearned for more.

So I embarked on [TapRPG 2 - The second one](https://store.steampowered.com/app/878590/TapRPG_2__The_Second_One/) (The title makes sense when you play it, i promise!)

The process to make this was a lot easier, I used the base engine  from number 1 and improved it immensely.  Story was the name of the game  in this one, so many twists and turns and even a secret ending!

To thank you guys, if you played number 1, reply here with a  screenshot of your stats and I'll give out some free steam and android  keys for number 2.  I'll put on a sale on homeland on steam in a couple  of weeks so it will just cost $1, so wishlist that to keep track.  

A little on the gameplay: A classic topdown overworld with lots to  explore. The dungeons/levels are 2d sidescrollers where your hero  automatically walks forward. When you engage an enemy you have an attack  button, defend button, potions and jump. It's about learning the  monsters patterns to defend when it gives it attack cue and smashing  attack when you've stunned it. If you have god like mashing skills  you'll be very successful.  Because you can defend, dodge, tap falling  obstacles you can get through the game with skill alone (with a few stat  checks), but for the more casual you can level up and get stronger, buy  more wepaons, et cetera, so you will always progress.

Here are some links and screenshots to finish with.  Thanks a lot everyone. I couldn't have done it without you all.

rpg_gamers,t3_9esbi8,"New Vampire RPG ""NightHawks"" based off of the Cult Classic Vampire: The Masquerade BloodlinesDisclaimer: The game is heavily inspired by, not based on Bloodlines. I read an article that said this game was based on Bloodlines, which I now know is not true. I apologize sincerely. 

A new and desperately needed vampire game is being funded over on Kickstarter. It has raised $45,000 in just 4 days, so if you're interested go check it out. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/753131002/nighthawks-the-vampire-rpg-0/description

Nighthawks is the brand new urban fantasy RPG from Wadjet Eye Games (The Blackwell Legacy, Unavowed, Technobabylon) and writer/designer Richard Cobbett (Sunless Sea/Sunless Skies, The Long Journey Home).

Description: Three months ago, you died. And in that moment you were reborn as something new. A monster. A predator. Not a creature of the night, but one of its masters.

Unfortunately, things aren't simple as they used to be. Vampires have finally been exposed, and though your existence is tolerated, your new nature is not. You came to the City hoping for a new start, but found only suspicion and starvation. Now you stare at the ceiling of your cheap hotel room as a penniless outcast, suckling on rats and destined to wither away.

But every new era brings new opportunities, and in the political chaos of a world gone mad, even an outcast may rise. An outcast can change everything.

This is the story of how you rose.

The beginning is very similar to bloodlines as well as the Morality/Character customization. Though this game is more of a visual novel.

rpg_gamers,t3_9egzt8,"CRPGs that aren't party-based?lately i've been really into Divinity: Original Sin 2 and i've been trying to get into Baldur's Gate and Darkest Dungeon. I love all these games but my problem is the party system.

Even in Diablo 3, where all you need to do is put some equipment/weapons on your follower, I couldn't stand it. 

I know that in some games you have the option to go off on your own, but ultimately the game is still designed to be a party experience so I feel like I'm missing out.

Or, you know, keep the review to less than 10 minutes. Because ain\'t nobody\'s gonna watch a review that long. But if it\'s written out, I can breeze through it in minutes rather than hours. What exactly does the video have to offer? I get to hear some dude\'s voice over random gameplay footage? Joy.', 'A 2 hour long review?!', 'As I said I would do, I\'m critiquing the first 10 minutes of your critique.  No more.  I\'m applying the same standards of ""what you have to do to keep the audience\'s attention"" as most screenwriters and filmmakers use, since you\'ve made something as long as a feature length film.  The first 10 minutes, aka most of *Act I*, is the point at which audiences start fidgeting in their seats and going ""WTF?"" if you are not doing certain things to satisfy them.\n\nWho is the audience?  You have said it\'s people who have already played the game.  I haven\'t, but I\'ve demoed the beginning of the game.  I got turned off for pushy narrative reasons, didn\'t feel like being dumped in a hot tub with some woman I didn\'t know.  I found I wanted to play the 10-year-old Pippi Longstocking girl character, *not* Geralt.  I tried the demo of the original Witcher quite awhile ago, and made it much farther in that before giving up.  Basically I completed that demo, but didn\'t like it enough to buy the game.  So although I haven\'t *much played* the game, I\'m passingly enough familiar with it, not to be clueless.  *Probably* gonna turn out to be enough to comment on the first 10 minutes of your critique.\n\nI am writing this at 5:30 into your video, at which point you display the ""Part 1 The Open World"" banner.  I already see 2 *big* problems with your work, enough to stop and write this up immediately.\n\nThe first is, *you\'ve been repeating your point over and over again the entire time*.  I don\'t need 5:30 to hear 20 different versions of ""nuancing critique"".  You are very defensive, and it\'s to no purpose as far as any *audience* is concerned.  You could have made your point in *30 seconds of monologue* and moved on.  I think you\'ve never picked up a book on screenwriting, or if you have, you didn\'t get it and didn\'t apply what was in it.  You\'ve gotta cut this down, to keep people from falling asleep.  At the rate you\'re going, I would estimate your 1 hour 41 minute video *is actually worth* a tenth of that.  If you keep going at this rate of *redundancy* and don\'t improve.  You\'ve taken ~100 minutes, that means someone else could do the whole thing in *10 minutes*, if I\'m correct.  Think about that.  \n\nThe second is, *the video has nothing to do with what you\'re saying*.  It doesn\'t illustrate any point you\'re making.  I think it\'s good to have ""scenes from the Witcher III"", especially for audiences (like myself) who aren\'t as familiar with the game as you are.  I can get a feel for the game that way, with some montage.  But it doesn\'t have anything to do with the words coming out of your narrative mouth!  So it starts feeling like filler and that becomes a problem.  Especially when the audience knows this is a 1 hour 41 minute piece and they could be getting *a lot more of the same*.\n\nOk, I will now continue with the remaining 4:30 of the allocated critique budget.  I\'ll make a 2nd post about that.\n', 'From 5:30 to 10:00 you mostly talk about the ""Ubisoft open world model"" with all the question marks to go visit.  As a game designer, I have less problem your treatment of that section.  I don\'t think it\'s written as tightly as you *could* write it, but it\'s not anywhere near as information poor as your beginning was.  I\'m guessing if you were applying really superlative editing skills, you could cut this in half.  That would mean in total, you\'ve delivered about 3 minutes worth of content in your first 10 minutes of video.  If that trend continues, your 100 minutes of video is actually worth 30 minutes.\n\nIn this section, the video relates to you what you\'re saying much more of the time.  Not always.  I\'d say 80% seeming relevance.\n\nAnd that\'s it!  You could be making a fantastic 30 minute video with more discipline and skill.  Or you could chop this up into less ""tight"" pieces of content, serialize their release for other people\'s sanity, cut down on the filler *a bit*, and still have a much stronger communications product.  Or you can ignore what I say and keep boring a number of people, not getting to the point, and causing them to skip your video entirely.

The only exception to that is the last boss on the main story, he doesn't take shit for damage from bombs.\n\nAlso the hair blowing in the wind bug wasn't a thing for my play-through, so i wonder what the cause of it is.\nPerhaps its the difference from console to PC?\n\nTo add: There is a mod for the witcher 3 from the developers that reduces the amount of skill points required for each talent, while still retaining the level requirement on slots, to provide more freedom of choice in choosing skills.""]"

I have about 20$ on my microsoft account, and figured I'd pick up an RPG. This month I've finished Kingdoms of Amalur and Dragon Age Origins. I thought of getting DLC for one or both, but I feel like I'd be too over-leveled for Amalur's DLC since I was extremely thorough on my first playthrough, and for some reason I haven't been able to connect to the Dragon Age Origins servers all month, which prevents me from accessing DLC. 

I have a PS4/PC, so anything multiplayer I probably won't get since I could just play it on those platforms with friends, but this credit is basically free money from a gift card I just haven't used, so I don't mind playing something on 360 that's available/better on another platform, since I'd have to buy it with my own money there. 


KOTOR 1 or 2(Actually bought KOTOR 2, it wouldn't download, tried everything, still didn't work, so I contacted Microsoft and got a refund. Apparently this is an issue experienced by several other people, both on reddit and gamefaqs) so not gonna risk another purchase.

* Risen series 
* Sacred 3
* Two Worlds 1 and 2
* Bound By Flame
* Dragon Age 2(kind of want to hold off on this until the DA servers (at least on 360 are fixed so I can import my data) 

* Arcania
* Dungeon Siege 3
* LotR: War in the NOrth
* Divinity 2
* Lost Odyssey 

These are just ones I have interest in, that are shown under the roleplaying section of the store. 
I have Witcher 2, Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallouts, Borderlands, all the more well-known stuff on PC or PS4 or already on 360. 

I'm actually interested in the seemingly obscure western RPGs like Risen and Gothic(though I don't think the latter is on 360), so any opinions/experiences of those would be greatly appreciated.

They all make perfect narrative sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDragon Age: Origins doesn\'t have a strongly typed good/evil mechanic, but I think most critical points have only two outcomes of which one is more obviously Eeevil.', 'The biggest problem is that a lot of games follow tropes laid out by literature and film, non-interactive media, without thinking about differences. Movies and books too often have clear divide between ""good"" and ""evil"" sides in the story: it\'s simpler to get the reader/watcher to feel hatred for the villain who kick puppies then for one who\'s reasonable and well-meaning in his own way (just not one that\'s compatible with that of hero). Sometimes, this gets irritating even in those media - I mean, how many save-the-world-from-ultimate-evil plots do we really need? But in an RPG it can be even worse.\n\nBasically, there are two options the developer can take if they allow the player to be ""evil"" in this case:\n\n1) Be the lesser evil, in which case, player can do bad things, but only as long as they are not very closely related to the plot. This is often exemplified by ""evil"" option being ""ask for money from the person you saved"" and ""be rude to everyone"". But you can\'t fully align yourself with the other side, and you get to defeat the same boss at the end of the game, no matter how ""good"" or ""evil"" you were through it.\n\n2) Allow the player to join the side of evil. The problem is, since our evil is mostly of cartoonish, kick-the-puppy-then-enslave-the-world kind, you\'re going to kick a lot of puppies, too, down on that road. And you just can\'t feel reasonable when doing that - kicking the puppies is the activity solely reserved for unsympathetic characters, and most of us are NOT good enough actors to play a character we feel absolutely no connection to. Also, there is a question of end-boss - either the developers need to design an alternative combat, or fall back on the old ""kill the evil boss to usurp his position and rule the world alone"" cliche to force the player to suffer the same end-game combat anyway (boo).\n\nIn my opinion, there is no good way to make most players enjoy playing puppy-kicking character. Evil should be more reasonable, more subtle, more seductive. Better yet, do not design ""evil"" side in your story: make all sides strive toward something only one can have, with evil creeping up on them as the stakes get higher, suggesting an easier way out of complex situations. Of course, this approach requires a very good writer on the team (one that can avoid overt puppy-kicking, yet introduce really evil solutions to the game), and that\'s not what most teams have, or even aspire to have. Barring that, screw the ""evil"" - just give the player sides with different (mostly reasonable, but a little bit flawed and utterly incompatible) ideologies, and let him decide what evil is, and maybe try a different path on the next playthrough. Country torn by a civil war where every side has its own truth is way more likely to have you trying ""evil"" side than a defend-the-motherland-from-demons scenario (just don\'t model the said civil war on the American one - it become too clear-cut a case for most people in recent years).', 'In Tyranny you can choose between being neutral and evil pretty much :)', ""Another problem for me is that in real life, evil characters don't think of themselves as evil. What many games offer (kotor being prime example) is some kitten-kicking caricature of evil, that's not fun to role-play as at all."", ""I don't have a problem with game offering limited, clearly defined choices/paths (like, good and bad). But my problem is that sometimes I really *want* to be bad (being bad should be fun, right?) but I usually *can't* at the end. Like, I generally don't feel like being asshole *and* I can't get into bad-character-role enough either cause it's not really believable or there is no benefit to it."", ""In Dragon Age 2 I really liked that the middle option was 'sarcastic'.

The guy was asking what game he should play and I was surprised that a majority of comments pointed toward Tales of Symphonia over the others.\n\nI\'m often the first to think everyone has an opinion, and unless one has a strong preference for more action oriented battles, I can\'t see why someone would choose Tales of Symphonia over Final Fantasy, unless they are trolling or just like to cheer for the underdog.\n\nI am aware that the gamecube wasn\'t graced with many RPGs and this one might be in it\'s top 5 but compared to the likes of Final Fantasy, saying it pales in comparison is being modest.\n\nThe game looks great in the beginning but it is obvious that they rushed and lacked budget as the game went on. Iselia, the first village is beautiful and as you visit areas you can notice the quality decreasing. As you progress, the world seems more and more empty.\n\nThe music doesn\'t make sense in many moments. Something really important can be happening and the usual tired music is played and makes it very underwhelming.\n\nThe writing is cheap, I can\'t tell how many times I said to myself ""Well, that\'s convenient"" or ""Why would he/she act like that"" or ""Wow, why haven\'t I heard about this important plot device before if it\'s that important to the world?"". For example, there is this one moment where you go rescue a girl from a prison, when this evil warden guy arrives and say ""Hey, your savior killed your grandma!"" with no context at all and the girl basically jumps in the arms of her captors because she\'s upset, and she didn\'t even let the MC explain. One the the main characters is clumsy, and often trips and falls and that, for some reason, often fixes the problem at hand.\n\nThe game is 2 players but doesn\'t play well. The battle system is a linear-3D system. Meaning that it\'s 3D but you can only move closer or further from the enemy you are targeting and that can be frustrating, especially since some of the healing spells have circular area of effects and it can be awkward trying to move in the circle. The camera follows the 1st player in a manner that on the screen he only moves left and right but for the 2nd player, if he targets an enemy in a line which makes it perpendicular to the first player\'s and its target, moving towards or away from the enemy is impossible and sometimes the camera keeps shaking, constantly inverting the moving forward or backwards from the enemy.\n\nThe character development is boring, you have no say on how a character develops. There is a gem system but it doesn\'t let you experiment with it and it\'s a system that needs experiementation, or a guide. Also its effects are often underwhelming. I was really disappointed by that as I was excited the first time I saw it.\n\nMost of the dungeons have tired mechanics, like push the block on the switch, or toggle that button to have a door opening. That\'s not the worst of it. There\'s a dungeon where you have to escort spirits and they act wildly, often getting stuck in corners. Google Tales of Symphonia Shadow Temple.\n\nThere are many more aspects that I could complain about but I\'m tired of typing.\n\nI don\'t understand why it\'s so well liked, I\'ve finished more than a hundred console RPGs, for which I did a TOP100 on reddit (maybe even on this sub) and this one is going in the bottom quarter.

There is very little grinding, which is always a plus, as progress is made like final fantasy 2, in which individual skills level up as you use them more often. The story is streamlined and simple, and lets the tactical strategy of battles shine as you experiment with formations and different character set-ups. The game is not a huge time investment, my first play-through only took about 35 hour, it being portable definitely help it feel shorter and more digestible. TLDR, if you have a 3ds and like rpgs, you should get this game.

rpg_gamers,t3_9cwoa9,"Any interest in an Arena-style, single-player game with rules inspired by TTRPG?Game dev here. I'm currently building out my game (posted previously here: https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/8r2r4m/critique_my_rpg_idea/)

I'm building the combat from the ground up and it's currently a turn-based tactical battle system (grid), much like D&amp;D and other traditional RPGs, so I decided to go the extra mile and throw in some other TTRPG elements, like action economy, flanking, and class progression/multiclassing. One of my favorite parts of TTRPGs is actually character progression, and how different classes interact with each other, so that will have a big part here.

So I was thinking of releasing the combat portion of the game early and seeing how balanced it is. Players will be able to build their party of four characters, starting stats/equipment, etc, and run through a series of fights in a type of Arena mode. 

Since it has about zero story, I'm probably going to price it at like a dollar or something, so people will get a lot of value out of it, hopefully, (and provide me with some more insight into how the combat system works).

rpg_gamers,t3_9crsaa,"Looking for a traditional RPG with the Holy Trinity.I have always wanted to play a classic RPG set in a fantasy world but every game I play in this genre seems to not have what I am looking for in terms of classes. Simply put, I just want some kind of tank, a dps (preferably a choice between magical and not as well as ranged or not), and a healer. Every MMORPG I can think of has a version of this but the classes start to blend together. I feel the line is drawn when every class has some elements of damage, tankiness, and sustain.

The game I have found that is the closest to this is Heroes of Hammerwatch. This game I feel has perfectly balanced the classes to the extent that each of them have some elements of each other but for the most part they follow their roles pretty strictly. The tank is the best tank there is. They have the ability to block arrows for the DPS and the tank deals some of the least damage in the game. The DPS has very little survivability and no healing whatsoever but deals massive damage. The magical DPS does very little single target but massive AOE and vice versa for the physical DPS. Lastly the Priest is the only class with a viable healing ability and their entire class is based around it. Heroes of Hammerwatch falls short however, because it is top down and near the end game becomes more of a bullet hell than a strategy RPG.

With the RPG's I have played I feel in no way as if I have to rely on my teammates, I'm looking for a game where you need your group to work as a team to win, instead of everyone just doing the same thing and spamming their macros. The only real requirements that I am looking for are as follows.



1. That the game takes place in a fantasy world

2. That the game has at least 3 classes to choose from (being DPS, Healer, and Tank)

3. That the game has a large difference in the capabilities of each class.



The game can be real time, turn based, or anything in between as long as the game play all the way through still feels like an RPG. It doesn't have to be an MMO but I would like to be able to play online with at least 3 other friends.

rpg_gamers,t3_9cbb0f,"A necromancer conceptI was thinking...  
In games usually a necromancer character raises bodies that are available at the moment in the vicinity, or the raised undead just pop up from the ground.  
It could be an interesting mechanic to have the Necromancer build their minions from materials and arm them themself, and keep them in their hideout/lair on standby. In need they would summon the minion(s) with a spell that teleports the minion to them.  
That would also mean that minions are at a certain, finite number and there are minions that would be so work-intensive to put together to animate it just wouldn't worth all the time put into it. For example the stereotypical squishy skeletal horde that shatters from a heftier blunt swing would be just a waste of time to puzzle together, BUT collecting the remains of a mighty warrior of legend and piecing the skeleton together(followed by creating undead flesh and skin on it) would very well worth the effort. Although the stereotypical naked skeletal horde can work with certain corpses that have the skeletal structure in place, like dried out corpses held together by the dry skin and flesh, so you or your lackeys don't have to waste time with piecing the skeleton together.

That could give more immersion to the class and grant insight into just how damn hard is it to make those seemingly endless hordes of undead SEEM so endless.  
Also FAR more value to stronger undead. The usual ""black robe waves with their hand and the mess of bones just turn into an organized pack of perfectly pieced together skeletons"" just begs the question ""Why isn't everybody just does that? Couldn't you just modify it into an animate golem or animate armor spell and have a non-necromantic, non-demonic, albeit much more expensive horde of minions at your disposal?"".

rpg_gamers,t3_9bm6c4,"Creation of a medieval fantasy game using LoTGD template [browser, mostly text-based]So recently I was searching for the guy who ran a game I loved around 8-10 years ago now. That search has proven fruitless. I did, in my search, however, find the template that would have been used in its creation! Legend of the green dragon.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;THIS IS IN PART ME RECORDING, PUBLICLY, MY OWN THOUGHTS ON THIS GAME - BASED OFF OF ONE I PLAYED YEARS AGO.

&amp;#x200B;

While I tempted fate to find a similar server to the one which I played many moons ago, that too has proven fruitless.

&amp;#x200B;

I've taken it upon myself, now, to recreate the game. Initially (originally) called Crusader Knights, I'm changing it slightly. Last word style. Only because the domain for the above is an astonishing $3000 to purchase! NO THANK YOU.

&amp;#x200B;

The gist of the game will be LoTGD. However, it wont be solely text-based. I mean to say, I'll be including graphics (not like Travian or Ikariam etc.) that will serve as a back drop &amp; possibly a menu. It's an option to be toyed with. 

The game itself will be set around the medieval period with fantasy elements (I'll be straying far from most LoTGD games in terms of names, weapons, armour, and whatnot) - I wont be making another clone, but something different (and similar? lol wut).

&amp;#x200B;

You will start the game as a medieval lord, with a retinue of 5 soldiers. You're a poor lord, a lesser noble. You must work your way up the ranks of society (and levels) to increase your prestige and glory. You use this to increase your settlements prosperity (the game will have main cities, towns etc. that can be found and travelled to - each player will have the option, after achieving in-game goals \*yet decided\* to found their own settlement. The settlement will be 'findable' by other players who explore the wilderness (possibly on a direction basis, to enable the recording of what way to go?) (You wont be able to fast travel to these settlements, is what I'm thinking right now) and can be built up and used by kingdoms (and then empires) as areas to operate with their members. 

&amp;#x200B;

There will be a map (very large) where kingdoms (and empires) can place their starting castle and then will be able to build outposts and fortresses to solidify positions and permanently capture resources on the map (that then go into the kingdoms (or empires...) coffers at the end of each day. The kingdom (...) can commission its members armies and grant fiefs (split its territory among its members, like a feudal system) - choosing what % of the upkeep it will pay, if any at all. The remainder is paid for by the lord in question. 

&amp;#x200B;

All lords can field an army, on the main map, whether they are members of a kingdom (...) or not. That army will, of course, be difficult to maintain for a lone lord as they do not have the benefit of a kingdoms organisation and whatnot (reducing costs for upkeep, amongst other things) - not to the extent fielding an army will be a waste of time or effort, but difficult so as to make sure lone lords cant just mess with a kingdom or other lords willy nilly, like any RPG choices need to be made and men spent are men lost and whatnot. Recruiting systems for lords and kingdoms will differ, player settlements inside a kingdoms reign will have positive or negative effects on its economy.

&amp;#x200B;

The main map and wilderness will be two separate entities. The wilderness wont be looked at on the main map, so it'd be considered everything outside of it. Player settlements wont appear on the map unless a kingdom has been established and the settlement was built upon the main map, not in the wilderness. Thus again bringing to question the benefits of being either a lone lord or in a kingdom (... or empire).

Settlements can't be built over resources on the main map, only near them (certain radius to effectively contribute to economy) - only outposts and castles / fortresses / etc. can. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is most of what I've got right now, that I may forget about (small details may escape me) - this is of course excluding obvious details that I simply wont forget. 

&amp;#x200B;

But something I've always struggled with was creating a character identity that wasn't just picking the good choices, or bad choices, or the choices to get the most experience. I tend to simply pick options on the spot, as I haven't really developed an identity to base my decisions on. So for those of you that can, how do  you go about creating one, and making sure your decisions fit with your character?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/9bgo3j/how_do_you_develop_and_maintain_a_character/,"['[deleted]', 'First - I do not do that when I play a roleplaying game but it is something that happens to me and to many other writers when you write a character for a story - if you put enough work into them they kind of come alive in your head and do whatever they want.\n\nSo how much preparation do you want to put into it? You can simply freeform at first thinking of what the character would do in each situation. It might take a while but at some point you might have a mental image of this character and how he thinks so decisions should be easier.\n\nIf you want to be more methodical you can write up a backstory and when you decide something you can check the backstory for significant factors as to what this character would act like. When faced with a decision where the backstory provides nothing to suggest how the character would act you can make up a story in the past on the spot that would explain his actions in the current situation and add it to the backstory . This way you can make sure that any future decisions are consistent with everything you have done so far. Eventually you will start feeling how the character thinks and will start using the notes less and less.\n\nStill that would only work if the game would actually provide something more than the good/evil/greed options as they usually do so that the character can actually act consistently without always picking one of the three.', 'This is a difficult one as its hard to put yourself in somebody elses shoes but i guess the best way to do it would be to try to associate with a character you know from somewhere else ""what would whats his face do here?"" Another option is to head in the chaotic neutral direction and grab a coin to flip or a dice to roll and leave it completely upto fate in decision making, this way you dont even know yourself what your character will end up doing', 'Look up a D&amp;D questionnaire, it will usually give you a list of around 20 questions or so that ask how your character feels about certain thing or what they would do in certain situations.  ', 'What I do is I establish some sort of general rule book at the beginning to determine what my character does and doesn\'t do. (e.g. My character will never resort to bribes unless the questgiver is clearly rich, my character will never kill unless absolutely necessary, my character has disdain for soldiers, etc.) Add rules as you go along the story and get a feel of the world your character lives in.\n\nIt also helps to have some sort of backstory in order to understand *why* your character does something.\n\nFor example, the Shepard I\'ve played through in Mass Effect was a ruthless colonist who is trying to make up for her sins. When she was just a teenager, her friends and family were slaughtered by Batarian raiders, which naturally scarred her for life. The mission on Torfan involved a group of Batarians and she was consumed by rage. This gave her a lapse in judgment, causing the death of 3/4 of her unit. Then, she ordered the execution of surrendering Batarians, cementing her reputation as the cold, calculating, and brutal and she earned the title of ""the Butcher of Torfan.""\n\nBy the events of Mass Effect, she is deeply ashamed of this, knowing that the people serving underneath her are terrified of her, so she makes attempts to atone.

rpg_gamers,t3_9b7evu,"[SPOILERS ] Finished and loved Tides of Numenera. Can't stand PST:EE. What is wrong ?I finished Tides in almost one go back in December 2017 when I was on a sick leave at home for 6 weeks. Took me 35 hours.


Now I have a lot of time again and wanted to play some oldschool cRPG. Bought the PST:EE since I never really managed to finish the original one. I remember that I enjoyed PST back in the day. Now with the PST:EE ?


Can't stand the characters, don't care about the story. hate the graphics. I complain about dull and low amount of combat encounters but in Tides combat was almost non existent. Atrocious quests lines. For example, becoming a mage requires you to run from district to disctrict to grab some seeds or whatever for that old women. This quest line made me grow grey hair. Another example. Fall-from-Grace joins your party only if you talk to every woman in the Sensate and learn more about their stories. I couldn't care less here I just find myself skipping the conversations. And Clerk's ward is the point where I gave up after 12 hours of gameplay.


I just can't unite with the world and the atmosphere here. Everything is really weird. I love weird stuff, but here it doesn't feels good. You are literally ripping off your eye or pulling of organs from zombies. Yuck. The only positive I can think of right off the bat is the music which is really beautiful. Although there are not many songs so it keeps repetitive over time. 
Also I really lack the character customization equipment wise. Nobody can wear anything as their have their own weapons and gear. Except maybe tattoos and some jewellery.


On the other hand, Tides was beautiful. Everything looks beautiful ! It is weird in a good way. The machines you come across, the artifacts from old ages, the world. I just love it. Graphics are beautiful. The story could be better but still it was nice and even tho I prefer games with a lot of combat involved and character customization like Icewind Dale or Baldurs Gate, here for some reason I didn't lacked this feature. Can't explain why.
 
[SPOILER ] Also that moment where you find a way to send back home the little girl you save at the beginning of the game through a portal where she belongs made me feel empty and I thought I lost her for good. This made me drop a tear almost. I felt empty as I felt really connected with the character. And when she came back before the end of the game as an adult to help you .. oh man, that was ""the moment"" for me. Very memorable moment.


I just gave up on PST:EE and just installed again Icewind Dale EE and almost halfway through in 3 days. It just gave me exactly what I needed at the moment. A proper AD&amp;D combat oriented adventure.


Maybe I just chosed to play PST:EE at the wrong time or maybe I should have waited for the game to get better in every way, story and combat wise and I should have give it more time since 12 hours are not much. Or maybe the game is just not for me.

They aren't really 2-dimensional in the proper sense, more of a bit isometric, but have very deep world building and the writting is really well done."", '**Age of Decadence**\\- highly recommended and how you build your character matters a lot (Some critics might say it matters too much, haha!)   Rather than classes, the game has ""backgrounds"" which affect many of the sidequests you get and how you play the game. For instance, if you play as a ""Merchant"" or ""Loremaster"", you may get through the whole game without getting into a single fight, whereas if you play as a ""Mercenary"" or ""Assassin"" you\'ll likely be in quite a few fights.   You may occasionally have the opportunity to switch to a different background based on choices you make.  Note that it\'s a very dialogue heavy game, but it is not a visual novel, as there are frequent skill / attribute checks which affect what you can do...  It\'s a relatively short RPG but has a huge amount of replay value.\n\n**Expeditions: Viking-** another great CRPG where how you build your character matters quite a bit... There are no rigid classes so you can build your character however you want.   Great deal of choice &amp; consequences and great turn-based tactical combat.   \n\n**Blackguards** is a strategy RPG (no choices or roleplaying really, just turn-based combat) but has a great character system based on ""The Dark Eye"", which is RP system very popular in Germany  \n\nHarebrained Schemes **Shadowrun** games are also worth checking out.  Character build isn\'t quite as deep as some others but a good variety of ""archetypes"" or classes to choose from than can affect how you complete the game.  My favorite one is Dragonfall, but Hong Kong is a close second.  Returns is still very good but just seems very basic compared to the other two.  Fans made a expanded edition of ""Dead Man\'s SwitcH"" that you can play in Hong Kong which is how I\'d recommend experiencing the first game.  ', 'Underrail']"

rpg_gamers,t3_9aam6h,"RPG Origin | RPG Development and Discussion CommunityHi everyone! We originally posted this over at /r/gamedev, but I was told some of ya'll might be interested too. So here we go!

I just wanted to pop in today to give a formal introduction to a development community I've been working on building up over the past few months. I really wanted to wait until I had something substantial before I made this post, so I've been holding back for a bit until now.

​

[RPG Origin](https://www.rpgorigin.com) is a revival project aimed at carrying on the torch of a development community that was first formed nearly 20 years ago. This was known as Mirage Source, both a community and an open source online RPG engine and toolset programmed in Visual Basic 6 which was released out of a small indie game project known as Mirage Online. The engine, although dated and severely limited even at the time, really did a lot to bring many individuals from different walks of life into game development, some of whom now do it professionally for companies like Bethesda. I personally credit it for much of who I am today.

​

The aim of [RPG Origin](https://www.rpgorigin.com) is to create a community focused on the fun and actual process of game development rather than the end result. Getting on Steam is great, but it's also perfectly okay to do game development because you simply enjoy it as a hobby. Our intention is not to foster an assortment of blockbuster indie titles, nor is it to train you to be a AAA developer. Our sole intention is simply to provide a platform and community through which we may all, new and old, experience the joy, passion, and excitement that is hobbyist game development, particularly for the role-playing game genre. Discuss and share game theory, programming, art, and more. Post about your project in our [Games section](https://www.rpgorigin.com/community/games/), or discover other active games being developed within the community. Everyone is welcome here.

​

We also invite general RPG discussion and role-play. It is in our name, after all. I'm personally currently working on a forum-based role-play game themed around piracy. Hopefully we'll see a release of that soon.

​

In addition to the community itself, there are a number of in-house projects aimed at RPG and online RPG game development. These consist of [Lunar Engine: a free, open source, multi-platform 2D online RPG engine built in C#/.NET](https://www.rpgorigin.com/community/resources/lunar-engine-alpha.4/) and [Mirage Web Engine SP: a free, open source, multi-platform 2D RPG engine built in JavaScript](https://www.rpgorigin.com/community/resources/mirage-web-engine-sp.12/).

​

We are still a young community and change is something that we are very open to. I would really like to hear any feedback you may have. We are always open to suggestions!

Hellions Claw Clan: On this server magic does not exist, here its witts and might that get you by, though magic does not exist like in other RPGs my clan has the closest thing to it, this clan has warriors who are always welcome in clan but some clan have been given the ancient secret teachings of the Clan leader Zangina, Zangina is a wise old shaman who is called Old Zangina as she is 120 years old, she communes with the ancient ones who are ghosts in the world, she reads portents on individual's via bone tossing, tea leaf reading, palmestry, sky gazing ect. She is also familiar with roots and healing plants as well as poison ones, she creates potions that can alter the state of mind in others, cause sleep, become addictive, and many other aspects, she also knows many spirit dances with different effects such as hypnotism, cause sleep, cause terror, she is a master ventriloquist and can throw her voice mixed with her highly trained mimicry her voice may sound like that of another, she practices voodoo on her enemies that work on suggestion one places on themselves unknowingly, she has mastered the direction of winds and the environment and will often use both to suggest her vanishing or appearing out of thin air or from a dust cloud or from the waters, she uses highly reflective garments to appear invisible, these secrets and more are a family secret and all have been shown to one other in entirety and that is her chosen successor Mutinay who is the beauty of the exiled lands and desired by many which to Zangina holds much sway and influence over others, becoming ill and wanting her legacy and secrets to carry on she has opened a school for her arts one guised as a place of shaman services offered for a fee, those worthy and of interest will be taught some of her secret ways, Zangina knows her time alive is short and has seen the future in where her clan is captured and killed and forced into slavery by the rival clan and their leader rise to power, this she cannot allow and will do all in her power to see Mutinay be surrounded by loyal allies and one day be crowned queen of the exiled lands.

I hope to find a few good players i will be picking members based on application, personality, and availability, look forward to RPing with possibly you in the very near future.

rpg_gamers,t3_9a11ql,"Ash of Gods: Redepmtion. My experience with this Banner Saga-like tactical RPG.[Ash of Gods: Redepmtion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/691690/) is a cross between a tactical RPG and a visual novel in the vein of Banner Saga, which came out this Spring. A lot of people accuse it of ripping Banner Saga off, but I must say this is not true. While there are a lot of similarities, these games are different enough in some important aspects, even though they share the art style and the genre. After all, not all JRPGs are rip offs of each other, even though they are often far more similar (up to the existence of RPGMaker) :) People who think the game's creators should be sued don't understand anything about games.

​​

Now, I'm actually all for people cloning Banner Saga - it's a good game, with lots of good ideas, and I can stand a few very similar games, especially if they to improve some aspect, or even just tell a different story, as long as it's not a deluge (it's not - the art style is too costly to reproduce massively). For example, [Tahira: Echoes of the Astral Empire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/691690/) is a very good Banner Sage-like, which managed to present a similar, but different combat system with a slightly different focus, and deliver a good story, if with far less branching and moral choice. But is Ash of Gods: Redemption any good?

​​

Let me preface the rest of this (very) long review post by saying I completed the game, but I don't think I was a ""good"" player. Maybe I'm just dumb, and couldn't crack the combat system's secrets, or see something obvious. I mean, there are people who complete the game on the highest difficulty, and I just can't imagine that - I barely muddles through on Normal. So maybe my experience is not typical, and should not be a basis of your opinion. But I think I played enough other RPGs, with various combat systems, and I usually was far better at them, than I ever was in Ash of Gods, so either there is a subtly difference I missed, or the game has the flaws I ascribe to it. With that in mind, let's proceed.

​​

First of all, I must say the team nailed the art style. The game characters and locations look good. The only problem is the enemies - they are well-drawn, but have too little variety, and since the game is about twice as long as Banner Saga, you often get the feeling you're fighting the same bunch over and over again, but it somehow gets more powerful every time.

​​

The length, in general, is the curse of this game. When I first played Banner Sage, I lamented its shortness: the game really left me wishing for more, and the wait for the second part was way too long. Not so here: the game manages to outstay its welcome about 3/4 of the way in, and I'm afraid you're going to start skipping all the talking bits, since they don't matter that much most of the time. This is not helped by less than splendid English localization, I heard (the game is originally in Russian, and I played it in this language, since it's my own), but the improvements to the translation are coming, according to the developers.

​

​The story concerns a world that was rocked by the arrival of some powerful being some thousands of years ago. These beings separated into two camps, and promptly began waging a war on each other, with some wanting to destroy the local human population for some reason, and others wanting to protect it. This war manifested in a periodical coming of Reapings: cataclysms during which powerful Reapers walked Terminum (as the world is called), led people against each other, and used pain, suffering and blood to charge magic standing stones. When a Reaping ended, these stones reverted to a different state, and became places of healing. This strange arrangement culminated in a great battle some hundreds years ago, during which some Curro (""good"" aliens) sacrificed themselves with the idea of defeating the Reapers and somehow stopping Reapings once and for all. But the ritual was not complete, because on of the participants was hit by some arrows, and could not kill himself in time. Still, Reaping stopped... Until now, of course. Now, another one started, and people are dying in heaps. The problem is, it seems different, somehow... Which is good, because the number of those willing to protect the local humanity dwindled a lot, while Reapers returned in full force.

​​

The story continues as a journey of 3 (eat that, Banner Saga, huh?) groups of fighters over the big map. The first group is led by captain of the guard, Torn Brennan, who manages to escape one of the towns where Reaping started with his adult daughter (though not before losing his wife). Most of all, he wants to protect his daughter, and heal her from the plague caused by Reaping, which is, for now, temporary put into remission by wearing of Strix stones - but those run out, and serve as a timer nagging the player to move ahead quickly, without mush rest (as does food in Banner Saga).

​

​The second groups is very small, just two people, and all it does is chase the first one, for various reasons. It's led by Blance, one of the few surviving curro, the one who couldn't sacrifice himself during the final battle of the last Reaping. He obviously wants to stop Reapings, but has many complications in his life.

​

​The third group starts in a completely different part of the world, and it's some escaped slaves/whores, led by an unwilling samurai-like super-warrior, Lo Pheng. His clan is tasked with killing Reapers, but when they are not doing that, they hire themselves out to the highest bidder.  This is how he finds himself far away from his native island when Reaping starts, face to face with one of his clan's legendary enemies. After the battle, he frees some slaves who were to be sacrificed to feed the Reaping's magic, and becomes the leader of otherwise all-women crew.

​​

The stories start well enough, and are interesting to read at first, but toward the end, it becomes apparent that most dialogues might as well be done in JRPG style where you don't ever choose anything, but just press ""next"" button to see more text, and it feels inconvenient, and somewhat boring by that time, I'm afraid.

​

​However, the worst I have to say about this game is to be said about the combat system. Where Tahira: Echoes of the Astral Empire managed to make a step to the side in that respect, and create a distinct, but interesting and balanced combats, Ash of Gods: Redemption's battle system is, to put it charitably, confusing. During my 20 hours with the game, I was never able to say I mastered it. Sometimes, almost all of my characters would fall in the battle (and receive wounds that need to be healed by resting), and sometimes I wiped the floor with the enemies, but I was never sure of the reasons of the failure, or success.

​​

Part of the problem is the sameness of enemies, as I said before. Only Reapers bosses feel like a really powerful enemies visually - but they are, surprisingly, not the most dangerous ones! Unassuming crossbowmen, on the other hand, will often one-shot your characters even at full health and energy.

​​

Which brings me to the game's second combat problem, health/energy system. Unlike Banner Saga, characters do not lose their strength as they lose their health, so an enemy with 1HP left is as dangerous as at the full HP during his turn, and most enemies are \*quite\* dangerous. Instead of HP, you can choose to target Energy during your attack. If you manage to reduce it to 0, all further attacks against it will instead deal double damage against HP. So far, so good. The problem is, damaging Energy otherwise seem to do nothing. Theoretically, enemies with low energy should not be able to use their most dangerous attacks, but I never observed this effect - they always remained very dangerous. Whether this is because the basic attacks which do not require energy are too powerful, or because powered attacks require too little energy, I don't know, but attacking energy always felt more or less useless, with the exceptions of the boss characters, where the double damage vs. HP was worth it in the long run. I guess some might call this system an improvement over Banner Saga's, where it often made sense to leave low-Strength enemies alive until the last moment, but the problem is, I failed to understand how to use the system in Ash of Gods effectively, and I always felt that I was just blundering my way through the combats, beating them not so much by skill as by persistence or luck.

​

​As an addition to Banner Saga-like combat system, this game also features a mechanic that become somewhat popular in the last few years, without any good reasons. It's called ""cards"", but in reality, it's more like ""scrolls"" or ""potions"" in the normal RPGs, because you always get all cards (there is no real deck, and no drawing), and they are single-use items. Another example of this can be found in [Acaratus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/376410/Acaratus/), for example, and it's no good, either. Words like ""cards"" and ""decks"", which are used in both these games, invoke randomness in my mind, but there is none of it.

​

​What's worse, cards in Ash of Gods have so many drawbacks they are almost completely useless. The biggest problem is that they require a full turn to use, i.e. when you use a card, the turn passes to the enemy. Which, often as not, means you're better off NOT using a card. In fact, I only found this mechanic element useful during the very first turns of combat, before the enemy has a chance to reach you, or at the very end, when you want to deal with the last opponent who entered the battle during the combat on the far side of the field from all your heroes. At all other times, cards are not powerful enough to exchange them for allowing the enemy to take a free shot or move.

​

But to add insult to injury, a lot of cards have \*additional\* drawbacks! Like hurting your own characters as well as enemies. This make them even less useful, and I ended up just plain avoiding such card altogether.

​​

All in all, the game either does a really bad job of communicating how to fight effectively to the player, or it's really unbalanced, with a random difficulty curve. It was not a very enjoyable experience.

​

​That all being said, I can't say I don't recommend Ash of Gods: Redemption altogether. It has its moments, and if you're starved for more Banner Saga-like gameplay, you might find something of an (inferior) substitute in this game. I guess its sales were really hurt by coming out during the same year as Banner Saga 3 - ""the real thing"", I'm afraid, is better in all aspects, even though the final instalment wasn't very exciting, too. The authors are planning a console port, and the ending hints at a sequel, so if either of those happen, I just hope that the battle system is fixed, at least to some extent, and the combats are better balanced.

Honourable mentions to Dragon Age: Origins, and Fable. I love a good angsty backstory."", 'Morrowind ', 'FFX or Tales of Symphonia', 'Shadow Hearts! We need more horror rpgs', 'For me it has to be Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines. There are a hundred reasons why and reminiscing about it is probably going to make me reinstall for another playthrough this weekend, but I\'m just going to repost a phenomonal comment from the [VTMB sub] (https://www.reddit.com/r/vtmb/comments/5rvx9h/what_makes_vtmb_special/) that explains it better than I ever could:\n\n&gt;You could play it any way you wanted: There were exceptions, and some play styles certainly got more face time than others, but there were A SIGNIFICANT number of fights you could avoid by seducing or schmoozing the right NPC, bribes you could bypass by scaring the shit out of NPCs, and annoying conversations/riddles/puzzles you could blast through by fighting if you were optimized for it. Basically with a few glaring exceptions (sewers, end game) you could play ANY way you wanted and your play style was SPECIFICALLY rewarded by the devs with a unique solve condition and, in most cases, unique segments of story/character dialogue reserved for your method of play. No game did anything like this except a SCANT handful of CRPGs from the late 90s like Fallout and and Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura (which was also by Troika). Even years later games like Fallout 3/New Vegas/Mass Effect/Dragon Age/Knights of the Old Republic, etc have an almost paper-thin degree of customization and options related to roleplay-AS-gameplay by comparison (Though it\'s worth noting in my personal opinion New Vegas and Kotor 2 are exceptionally close out of that list - just not perfect). There aren\'t nearly as many options to talk your way over/past/through a fight, or to change the course of a conflict entirely in those titles as exist in VTMB.\n\n&gt;The writing, voice acting, and graphics still hold up: The writing is just phenomenal. Every character feels natural. The few who feel forced feel intentionally forced in order to sell the character as sarcastic or full of themselves, and the few that are over the top are so with good reason (and STILL well acted) and it\'s all delivered with facial expression and body movements that hold up to this day. Is the game graphically perfect? No. But the graphics are stylistic and moody in such a way that they not only perfectly capture the atmosphere of a World of Darkness game (any vampire setting, really), but they also manage to be timeless. There are dated techniques and shaders which, in spite of their age, LOOK RIGHT when you crank up the game TODAY because the devs took great care to establish a mood and make every aspect of interactions, whether it was sight or sound, complement that mood. Bloodlines accomplishes better than any other game I\'ve ever played Poe\'s ideal of \'unity of effect\' by ensuring every single element of the game world, from the texture of a back alley wall, to the narrow cone of light cast by a street lamp, to the clothes a bum wears and the way his voice actor portrays him, ALL feed the singular dark aesthetic of the game. The fact that this ALSO happens to perfectly reflect the mood and aesthetic of the original source material (VtM/WoD) is just a cherry on top.\n\n&gt;The game world feels alive: No game I\'ve ever played made me wonder about the backstory of wandering NPCs whose ONLY purpose is to walk around and serve as potential blood dolls should you find them in a darkened alley like Bloodlines did. I remember the first time I played it, wondering what every single citizen of Santa Monica, and every single dancer at the Asylum did when they weren\'t in my immediate field of vision. I remember seeing strangers who didn\'t speak and wondering if they would be introduced as parts of the plot later (also one of the only games I\'ve ever played to actually DELIVER on this idea). I remember thinking even the unvoiced NPCs looked so intricately detailed that I could determine things about their lives, motivations, and personalities from the glimpses I got of them in game. Even in cases where I couldn\'t REALLY find out more than was right in front of me, I wondered about it, which is something even games with massive cities full of hundreds or thousands of mobs couldn\'t make me do. (I still have a secret crush on black dress girl from the Downtown Alley, don\'t tell anyone).\n\n&gt;It did a lot with very little: Yeah, this is really worth mentioning. You have GTA and TES games these days that have cities full of NPCs - many of whom even have voiced dialogue - that feel like soulless husks compared to the tiny 3 block layout of Santa Monica in VTMB. There\'s just something magical about the way Troika used SMALL spaces and a relatively small cast (ultimately 20-30 characters total, if that) to tell SO much story and deliver SO many feels. I think it\'s because not ONE of those characters felt flat, unfinished, or designed SOLELY for a given quest (even the ones that literally only exist for a single quest). Somehow they all seemed to feel, from their lines to their voicing, like real people with fully formed existences outside of the moments I spent with them. I\'ve never played a game that accomplished this like Bloodlines, and seen many games do less than half as well at it with well over double the resources/size.\n\n&gt;It just felt right: This is where the music, vocals, visuals, gameplay, and writing all tie in. Have you ever gone for a drive late at night with the city\'s lights passing over you, and seen the world in a way that was so gritty and dim through your windshield, but which also left you feeling alive and invigorated because of its dark danger? Maybe you were listening to some particularly seedy sounding music and got this dark thrill, like a rush of vitality inside you in spite of the inherent murkiness of the midnight streets and people around you? World of Darkness was all about this, and Bloodlines just hit it out of the fucking park. Everything you do in that game feels so seedy and empowering at the same time - it makes you feel simultaneously stained and untouchable by the filth you walk through. I can\'t break down mechanically or easily explain how I think they captured this, I can only say it\'s the feeling I get from that game and a HUGE chunk of why I know it\'s special to me, and why I think it is special to many people. It\'s just something you can\'t get anywhere else and it fills you with a deep, dark satisfaction just to ""walk"" and ""breathe"" in the world of that game.\n\n&gt;There was nothing else like it at the time: And many of us would argue there has been nothing like it sense. I could list a lot more specific examples of things that set Bloodlines apart, but at the end of the day, honestly, the game was just unique. There were good games before and there have been good games since, but Bloodlines is the kind of game that changes the way you perceive games. It makes you realize that more than you imagined was possible with the right kind of team capturing the right kind of magic, and it leaves you a little emptier inside once you\'ve finished it, because you know you won\'t get an experience like that again any time soon, if ever. I\'ve played several great games since Bloodlines, but nothing ever captured my heart like it did.', 'Mass Effect', ""Dragon Age: Origins for me. \n\nI hadn't experienced the RPG genre much before that.

He wasn't just dickhead in opposition to me, my character had a personal vendetta with him. \n\nThe characters were all interesting to me, they all had their own backgrounds, motivations, etc. And there wasn't any real morality meter in the game, only approval and disapproval from your party. \n\nOn top of this it felt like I had agency to make choices that had far reaching affects on the people of Thedas, and sometimes I'd sit and think what would be the best way to go for award and if doing something that wasnt appealing would be worth it because the ends justify the means. \n\nDA:O got me into RPGs and I love it for that.

This is a really solid Mech RPG/Strategy hybrid with a cool story and Anime like animations.

You command an army with individual squads that are led by a leader who pilots a mech on the battlefield. On the strategy board you plan out the moves with a tactics system similar to the Shining Force or Front Mission series.

However, on the battlefield combat plays out like a mix between Valkyria Chronicles and Dragon Force (Saturn), where two squad leaders face each other by planning out their ground troops tactics, use special abilities to improve their aim, cripple the opponent's mech or ground troops, etc. Also, you can shoot the other mech by aiming like Valkyria Chronicles.

As an RPG fan i miss the PS2 days where companies like Konami, in this case, weren't afraid of releasing unique games with a blend of different gameplay styles that really created special games that stand the test of time and make me dust off my PS2 every now and then.

So, if you're like me, and love all the above mentioned games and also mechs, give Ring of Red a try and i promise you will love it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/992kfr/shout_out_to_ring_of_red_ps2/,"[""It's pretty darn awesome!

rpg_gamers,t3_98v9do,"Best Jrpg/Wrpg hybrid?First, I'll define what I mean by both; JRPG as in Final Fantasy, Tales, Dragon Warrior, Breath of Fire, Xenogears, etc; predefined characters, narrative-based, usually a linear plot with perhaps a minor branch or two. Combat systems are all over the place but tend to be turn-based. The advantage of these games for me are that they tend to have stronger characters and relationships, more involved plots, and greater emotional investment. Some of them have great combat systems as well. On the negative end, they often tend to be for younger audiences and contain annoying characters and humor and simplistic main plots (even though they usually contain complex relationships).

By Wrpgs I mean more of the Baldur's Gate, Might and Magic, Dragon Age, Elder Scrolls kind of games. You tend to create your own characters, have a more open world and plot where you can complete things in different orders and substantially change your path, and sometimes even have major branches. Combat is also all over the place but turn-based less often. The positives are more effect on the world and replayability, as well as better world atmospheres. The negatives are that the greater amount of choice puts lack of choices in greater contrast, and the main character's role and relationships are usually weaker due to being less defined.

What games, in your opinion, have bridged this gap well? I think that Dragon's Dogma, while pretty good, was more of a Wrpg developed by a Japanese company, so I'd say that the Witcher 2 and 3 are probably the best hybrids I've ever played.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/98v9do/best_jrpgwrpg_hybrid/,"['Anachronox - it blends both jRPG and wRPG elements. I highly recommend to try it.', ""Definitely Albion.\n\nThe game overworld is viewed from top, with the characters forming a conga line. Dungeons are in first person. The game has pre defined characters with strong backgrounds. The story and settings has tons of lore, but it's way more interesting than the average jrpg.\n\nIt's a beautiful game. I can never forgive my mom for thrashing that gorgeous big box."", ""By this metric of yours (more choice for the player, but heavy accent on the plot and characterization), pretty much any Bioware or Obsidian RPG fits, except for turn based combat; for that one in particular, there's Divinity: Original Sin 2.\n\nI might add that Bioware tried to pull a WRPG/JRPG hybrid with DA2 (I think they sort of said that in a pre-release pitch); it went rather poorly for them, even if the game isn't *that* terrible."", ""I guess the Growlanser series.   They're clearly JRPGs, but far less linear with a great deal of branching paths, multiple endings, and the ability to customize to your characters to some degree (varies by installment, but at a minimum you decide on what gems to equip which grants each character specific abilities bonuses).  Great series. Only 2 &amp; 3 (Growlanser Generations), 4 (Wayfarer of Time), and 5 (Heritage of War) have been released in English. You can play them in any order though.  \n\nCelesitan Tales: Old North is another one.  Again, it's primarily a JRPG, but you have choices to make (which will have consequences seen in future installments in the series) and some ability to customize your characters, since they can only equip a select number of special abilities, so you can make them Also like Growlanser the story and characters tend to be more mature than typical JRPGs.  \n\nA lot of the modern WRPGs tend to have predefined characters and narrative focused like The Witcher but it's clearly a WRPG.  \n\n\nUltimately it's somewhat of a false distinction, and really combat style and art style seems to be the main difference between J &amp; W RPGs.  Is Wizardry a JRPG series?  Recent installments are made in Japan and have Japanese art style, but the series started out in the US.  "", 'So...some of the things that run on a spectrum in RPGs might be a good place to start with classifying things. \n\nStory/World:\n\n* linear narrative (or centralized story) &lt;-&gt; choice-influenced story (or decentralized mission-based story)\n* large scale (worldwide event driven) &lt;-&gt; small scale (character driven)\n* linear path &lt;-&gt; open world\n* only certain things can be interacted with &lt;-&gt; full physics for world\n\nRole Playing:\n\n* scripted character appearance/personality &lt;-&gt; build your own character\n* pre-determined classes &lt;-&gt; blank slate\n* no stat gains -&gt; regular, defined stat gains  -&gt; regular, random stat gains -&gt; controllable stat gains\n* set pool of abilities  -&gt; class trees -&gt; universal abilities\n* solo -&gt; limited party -&gt; limited recruit choices -&gt; unlimited recruit choices\n\nCombat: \n\n* choosing commands &lt;-&gt; physical control of characters\n* turn based &lt;-&gt; real time\n* scripted encounters -&gt; random encounters -&gt; visible encounters -&gt;  fights in the world\n* no spatial component -&gt; formations -&gt; grid/terrain -&gt; open 2D field -&gt; open 3D field \n\n\nThere\'s plenty of other specifics but these seemed pretty universal to me. Then you\'re looking at the question of what defines a WRPG vs. a JRPG, but the characteristic features of each changes with time and franchise. There might be a median value for games of a certain era on the spectra above, but this will depend on what games people use to calibrate their impression of Western and Japanese.\n\nI think it is a commonly (not necessarily correctly) held opinion that JRPGs are characterized by leaning toward the ""scripted"" side (generally left, in the cases above) of the spectra, while WRPGs tend toward the ""choice"" (right) side. In that case, are you looking for games that tend to be in the middle of these sorts of average values? I think ""scripted"" vs. ""choice"" might be an easier metric to define things by instead of the very personal impressions of JRPG and WRPG.\n\nI would say things like [Valkyria Chonricles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyria_Chronicles) (which has a scripted story and pre-defined characters, hybrid turn-based/real time battlefields, and customize-able class job system) might be the baseline for crossover games. It has aspects that hit both ends of the spectra while also a few categories in the middle. Conversely, I would say games like the Tales of series, or Witcher are not crossovers. They have almost all of their systems concentrated on one side with maybe one exception.\n', ""Your definitions are... lacking. Both jRPGs and non-jRPGs can have linear or non-linear story, focus on relationships or lack there of, turn based combat or not, character customization or predefined characters, involved plots or slacking around. Those are not any indicators of a game being jRPG or not. Neither Dragon's Dogma or The Witcher are any kind of jRPGs(unless you define jRPG as an RPG that is developed in Japan which Dragon's Dogma obviously is)."", 'Skyrim', ""The Dragon Quest series established many of the standards for JRPGs.  But retained the feel of a classic RPG such as Ultima and Wizardry.\n\nOn the flip side, you can say something like KOTOR has a relatively linear plot, though it has the illusion of choices.  And its gameplay is more similar to something like Final Fantasy XII than it is most WRPGs.  So by some people's definitions, KOTOR could be a JRPG.  The only reason it isn't is because obviously it was made in the west, as WRPG is a classification of where a game is made and not its mechanics.  Just as Dragon Quest isn't a WRPG despite being closer to a classic western RPG than most WRPGs these days.""]"
rpg_gamers,t3_98s4v7,"[META] - What is your view on self-promotion posts within the subreddit?It is great to see lots of awesome discussions on the subreddit and we are hoping to introduce more opportunity to discuss new and old games going forward.

rpg_gamers,t3_98rem3,"Dear RPG gamers, what is your favourite instance of worldbuilding in a cRPG game?Just like in the title.

Personally I \*love\*, and I do mean love the worldbuilding in The Elder Scrolls games. Sure, they might not be perfect games gameplaywise, or even questwise (looking at you, main questline of Skyrim), but the worldbuilding is so deep and full of meaningful, extraordinarily beautiful lore. CHIM, the story of Nerevar, Lorkhan - it's all so great and fascinating.

With that said, I also love the worldbuilding in Might and Magic games. It's just an old instance of great writing and worldbuilding of a high fantasy world (with other things thrown in - you'll see why when you play through the whole of Might and Magic VII, for instance ;)).

I also find the Planescape setting for Planescape: Torment so unique, it's almost like science fiction fantasy.

rpg_gamers,t3_98jxzw,"Are there any games similar to New:Vegas?Hello, everyone. When I first started video games in 2014, my friend recommended I try out New Vegas. Since then, I've played through the game ten times and it's awesome. I've tried many other games and though a lot were good, none of them really have that New Vegas feel. I think you guys would rather I specify what I appreciated in NV to help you out, so here.

**Customizable Characters**

The ones where you decide your stats, skills, and appearance. Sure I can spec Adam Jensen to be better at punching or shooting, but there's nothing like making your own character's face and assigning a voice and personality to him or her.

**Open World**

I loved how the map was free for me to explore to my heart's desire, finding new shit wherever I went, but I'd also appreciate it if that world made sense. In Fallout 4, the heart of the Commonwealth was sandwiched in between raider groups and super mutants so you wonder why it was doing so well. In Fallout 3, you had little kids ruling over a cave that was right behind a super mutant nest. I want to avoid fridge logic like this.

**Weapon Variety**

New Vegas had a shit ton of weapons, which made multiple playthroughs all the more fun. 3 only had a handful, which is understandable because it was an earlier game. 4 had a bunch of weapons that, despite crafting, still only really had one weapon per niche and the combat rifle outclassed everything else.

**Branching Questlines**

I loved NV, Fallout 1, and Fallout 2 so much because of this. If you weren't sufficient enough in one skill, you could always try and find another way using skills that you did have. If none of your skills were good enough, you couldn't accomplish it. I loved the idea of freedom with a price. It limited you based on how you built your character, making your choices as a player have weight. Mass Effect has this renegade/paragon system, which I thought was fine, but your build was irrelevant and it had more to do with which dialogue options you chose.

**Pretty Good First/Third Person Combat**

Some of you might think it's dated now, but I still enjoy the combat in New Vegas and I liked how your skills actually translated to how your weapon handled. I love Fallout 1, 2, and Dragon Age: Origins as much as the next guy, but I love the feeling of using your own skill take down opponents rather than the RNG of isometric games, or the point and click style of others.

**Optional: A More Modern Setting**

As much as I love Dragon Age, not a huge fan of the fantasy genre, which is why I've never really tried any of the Elder Scrolls games. And shooting lasers is cool and all, but I like kinetic weapons that I could identify in real life.

And that's all she wrote. Can you think of any games that match all this criteria?

Edit: I forgot that I like third/first person combat because I get immersed more easily. Seeing arms/face and thinking ""Those are my arms/face!"" Anyway, going to bed. Can't wait to see your suggestions in the morning!

It’s very beginner friendly ', ""I highly recommend Divinity Original Sin 2 or Dragon Age: Origins.\n\nBaldur's Gate  seems to be the most common answer here, and BG it's ilk are undoubtedly classics, yet they can be a bit difficult to get into if you're not familiar with other RPGs like them or if you're not familiar with D&amp;D (and even then, it uses an old ruleset with some very unintuitive rules)\n\nDivinity: Original Sin 2 has a very easy to learn progression system, with extremely satisfying combat that is easy to learn but the amount of strategy you can use is staggering.The writing and story are also top notch. Overall it's one of the most fun games I've played in years and I played around 220 hours in the course of a month. \n\nDragon Age: Origins is a great choice as well.  It plays like a more modern version of the infinity engine games like Baldur's Gate, has a fun combat system, interesting companions with well fleshed out back stories, and depending on your choice of race and class, you can experience a variety of different origin stories for the prologue making your character feel more like a part of the world. It also means that certain characters you will have a completely different perspective on depending on what origin you pick. It was my first serious RPG (before that I'd only played Fable 2) and I loved it. "", ""Baldur's Gate is great and beginner friendly, the starting area even nicely incorporates tutorial into the game, so you will know how to fight and all. The lower the THAC0, the better armour you have, by the way.\n\nIcewind Dale is more combat-focused though, basically a dungeon crawl and it's harder, you also need to create a whole party, not just one character, so it's better to play it after BG or Planescape.\n\nArcanum is awesome, but be sure to install the fan patches that fix bugs and resolution. However the combat is less easy to get into than Black Isle/Infinity Engine games but it's an open-world game with a lot of choices (both quests and dialogues).\n\nThen there's Pillars of Eternity 1+2 and Tyranny, many of the devs who made them worked on the IE games, so that's a good choice too.

You don't get any companions though, not until Skyrim, and even there it's just one (you can have only one hireling at a time) who only has a number of given lines and that's it, they are all basically just a pack mule who can make combat easier and you can totally ignore them and play without one.

rpg_gamers,t3_983p6o,"Salty grumbles from a fan of third person wRPGs. (recommendations required!)**Warning: overcaffeinated rant ahead, TL;DR at bottom**

I've been playing RPGs since the eighties like many of you. After 2010 life got in the way and I didn't end up playing any new games for about five years. Now that I have, I'm a bitter and jaded man.

So here's my impression of the modern games industry and their failed attempts to appease me. I've stuck some of the games in bold. Seriously though, go to the TL;DR if you don't fancy a rant, you've been warned.

What's that? You're a fan of fully-voiced, third-person, narrative-heavy PC WRPGs? Your favourite game of all time was **Knights of the Old Republic 2**? You've been out of the loop for the past few years and want to come back to gaming?

Boy do we have a selection for you over the last few years!

So Obsidian made **Fallout: New Vegas** and Kotor 2. Then they got rid of their best writer and decided isometric homages were the way to go. Before that they did make **Alpha Protocol** though, the completely unbalanced spy game with more frustrating minigames than you can shake a stick at! Just try the hacking, it's harder than doing it in real life! I wonder why there was no sequel...

Speaking of no sequels... Troika? Yeah Bethesda got the Fallout rights instead of them so they're gone. Most of the folk are at Obsidian or InXile, who also have the isometric fever. No more vampire games for you!

Remember KOTOR? Well we've turned it into this sick-ass MMO **Star Wars: The Old Republic**, with a terrible art style and forgettable quests that don't allow you a great selection of choice! Also we've decided to butcher some of your most-beloved characters because money.

**Mass Effect 2** was great, wasn't it? Well so is the sequel, **Mass Effect 3**! Except it's exclusive to Origin so pony up. Oh and you'll need to buy this DLC for the story to make sense and to have all the companions. Don't forget galactic readiness levels and the multiplayer component! It's still been a hell of a journey, thank goodness the ending completely paid off with no need for a fan theory and mods and an additional DLC in order to fix it.

Have you tried **Kingdoms of Amalur**? It's the MMO that isn't with budget performances from our ensemble cast of wooden stock characters. You can throw over a hundred hours of your life away though! We'll do it better next time around! What's that? No next time? Oh.

Okay so Amalur didn't grab you, **Divinity 2** by the good folks at Larian will though! Granted it's actually from 2009 and we had to re-release it in order to fix things up and we are using the terrible Gamebryo engine, but it's a solid and enjoyable experience if you can get it to play right and ignore the average story and gameplay. What's a microstutter? What performance issues? Why are you uninstalling? No, all the sequels went with cRPG isometric worship as well, sorry. They're good games though! Can't you just come to grips with a different camera angle that completely takes you out of the world?

**Risen 2**! The sequel to that game that you didn't like! The one by those folks who made **the Gothic series**! It has pirates! What's not to love? Aside from the story, the gameplay and the repetitive fetch quests.

How about **Mars: War Logs**? It's like Knights of the Old Republic but without any budget or writing quality and with frustrating combat. Or why not try **Bound By Flame**, the fantasy re-skin with equally irritating problems!

So you weren't a fan of them, that's okay! **Dragon Age: Inquisition** is here! And this time it's totally not an MMO and the engine is completely stable. Let's not forget about that brilliant combat system or the embarassment of a plot with a DLC ending! Did we mention it's exclusive to Origin too? That's what you meant when you said 'I miss Origins', yes?

So you didn't like Bound by Flame and you didn't like Mars: War Logs, how about **The Technomancer**? Lots of graphical updates but all the same problems! We're getting closer to being as good as games from almost a decade prior though! Just wait until **Greedfall** hits, you might actually like it! Fourth time's the charm!

Don't worry, we've brought you **Mass Effect: Andromeda**! Without Shepard! Or any of the things that you enjoyed! You don't like it? Fine, no more Mass Effect for you, ever! You should just delete Origin at this point. What do you mean 'you already have'?

So you weren't keen on Risen, there's always **ELEX**! Forget about the eurojank issues of the Risen and Gothic series, because this time it's going to be different, we swear! Just listen to that superior voice acting from the protagonist, the person you have to listen to more than anybody else!

It's okay though, because at least we got **The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt**. One good third-person RPG for the PC. In six years.

**TL;DR/Irritable conclusion:**

There's only so many times you can play KOTOR, Jade Empire, The Witcher/Mass Effect trilogy and Dragon Age: Origins/Awakening over and over before they become stale.

If someone could kindly put me out of my misery and recommend me a third person RPG with good writing and gameplay that isn't any of the above, please do.

Maybe try out the older Witcher games; it might feel like a downgrade after playing 3, but it’ll flesh out the story/universe for you if you’re interested in that. Thirdly, while not much of an RPG, one can sink A LOT of time into Mad Max; it’s a bit of a collect-fest and the driving can be unforgiving before you get your rockets, but the foot-combat is pretty satisfying when you find the balance between offense and defense. Lastly, perhaps the Shadow of Mordor/War LotR games, which really feel like Assassin’s Creed (interested in those too, perhaps?) in Middle-Earth, but has some skill progression and you can choose your equipment from what you loot to fit your play style (bonuses from stealth kills, fire damage, etc.).', '[deleted]', ""Is it bad I get more roleplaying value out of Battletech, X-Com, &amp; Football Manager than I do modern RPGs not named Witcher?\n\nI didn't think Pillars of Eternity nearly as good as the critics made it out to be.

rpg_gamers,t3_96xd77,"Kingdom building RPGThe approach of Pathfinder: Kingmaker is making me itch to play some other Kingdom Building RPG, but it looks like there are not too many of them:

* Ni No Kuni 2(I still have to play this one)
* Spellforce series(more or less)
* Mount and Blade
* Legends of Ellaria (Early Access, so there is not much to do yet)
* Crusader Kings (more of a strategy game, though)
* Birthright(also a strategy game, with a very weird integration of RPG and strategy)
* Age of Wonder series(but we are entering 4x territory here)

If we limit ourselve to RPG with a strong focus on stronghold building,

I can think of:

* Dragon Age: Awakening(fits the bill nicely but too easy).
* Neverwinter Nights 2(I liked Crossroad Keep, but what you did with it didn't change much).
* Suikoden (I still have to play this one too)
* Pillars of Eternity but the Stronghold is largely irrelevant
* Dead State: The game really lacks defense missions that would make the stronghold itself come to life, but other than that, it fits the bill pretty nicely. It is a bit repetitive, thoughm with mostly zombies to engage from the beginningto the end.
* Regalia: Of Men and Monarchs

XCOM is out, because there is no leader character. Jagged Alliance would come close, but the country management is really weak, and it lacks a central base. Even more so for Battle Brothers.

The problem I have with most of them is that the Kingdom Building and RPG are very seldom integrated well (with notable exceptions like Mount and Blade), the would be lord/King usually keeps going on quests that are detached from ruling, or even solving problem in his kingdom).

rpg_gamers,t3_95o3vb,"Looking for a new RPG to dive into? It's time to give Divinity Original Sin 2 a try.I would love for you to [view the original post with all of it's media here](https://www.gameguider.gg/gameguider/blog/viewBlog/6), but if you would prefer to stay right here, all of the text will be below!

&amp;nbsp;

I had heard many different things about Divinity 2, but it wasn't until I got in there and tried it myself that I was able to get an objective view of the game and decide if it was the one for me. After 80 hours of gameplay, and probably 80 more to go, I've come to the conclusion that this game is absolutely for me and just might be the right game for you. 

&amp;nbsp;

Divinity Original Sin 2 is an amazing take at a classic RPG. Larian Studios really captured the essence of sitting around a table and playing D&amp;D with your best friends. Everything from an elaborate adventure to a dynamic world, you have so much freedom to approach the game in your own style.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

You awaken in a world full of turmoil. The holy group known as the Magisters are trying to save the world from being overtaken by the Void. The Void is being attracted to this world by the use of Source, a rare form of power that only a few can control. In order to complete their task of saving the world from the Void, the Magisters are hunting down anyone who has the power of Source within them, and doing whatever they need to, to get rid of it. Although what they believe to be a holy cause, a lot of their methods lead to great pain, or commonly even death for those who contain Source within them. 

&amp;nbsp;

You and your team have to navigate through all of this disorder and work together to fight for what you believe to be right. As you work towards bringing balance back to the cosmos, you will be exploring an expansive world caught in the midst of all this chaos. On your journey, you will come across all sorts of situation that will make you question your values, and then fight for what you believe in.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I was amazed at how many options I had when creating my first character - it felt like I was scrolling through the different classes forever. I was physically stunned when I understood just how much variety I had available to me when I started putting my whole team together. You have all the options available to you to build a team that will allow you to approach combat the way that you want to. Even if you had two characters that were both Knights, based on how you leveled them up, they could be completely different characters, with completely different abilities. Marvelously, while your options are large, the system Larian created to manage all of these choices is very easy to learn and navigate.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Turn-Based-Combat can commonly be a hit or miss system. You have my favorite, the Fire Emblem series, which makes combat easy to pick up but hard to master with their tile-based system. Then you have games like Final Fantasy and [Octopath Traveler where combat becomes more monotonous and time consuming rather than fun and challenging.](https://youtu.be/IQkLe77Pvdk?t=128)

&amp;nbsp;

So where does Divinity land? While not as easy to pick up as Fire Emblem's tile-based system, the amount of room for strategy and challenge that this system allows for, absolutely stands up with the best. Even with the regular difficulty, I was amazed at how testing the fights were right away. Often, I find myself quick saving before a fight, and attempting it 2 - 3 times, implementing and testing out new strategies along the way, to get past it. It’s absolutely invigorating to finally get past a challenging fight and bring your newly developed strategies along with you into the next one. 

&amp;nbsp;

What makes it a little more difficult to pick up is a few quirks that take some time to learn to navigate. I can’t express how important it is to not let this small curve turn you away from the game. It hurts me to think of all the people who were turned away from the game too quickly because it was too confusing or too difficult. If you take the time to get past this early learning curve, you will reap the benefits of a beautifully crafted game and turn-based combat system.

After having it for a few days, I’ve already invested about 80 hours into it, and I can tell I still have so much more to go.

rpg_gamers,t3_95ecmz,"What Do You Like/Dislike About Loot Focused Games (Like Diablo and Borderlands)?Greetings,

So full disclosure I am (and have been) making an RPG game focused on loot. I grew up playing thousands and thousands of hours playing games like Diablo and Borderlands. I love games where there are tiers of rarity and lots of loot to find.

For me the thrill usually revolved around figuring out a build ahead of time, and then trying to spec my character stats and find gear specific to that build. Then doing it again for a different spec. I also get a rush finding the ultimate weapon in a category (but then I'm frustrated when there's nothing better to find). I also like 100% item collection. I would spend hours trying to get every version of every item, something about having a complete item collection feels really good to me.

I wanted to hear from you regarding what you like about games with a deep loot system? For myself I never cared for the story and always felt it gets in the way of replay value. What do you love about loot focused games? What do you wish there was more of/less of? Is a good loot system something you want in an RPG, or do you just consider it one of the many check boxes? How important is 100% collection completion to you?

Side note: If you look at RPG + Loot tag on Steam there's only a bit more than 100 games. Do you feel this is an under-represented category?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/95ecmz/what_do_you_likedislike_about_loot_focused_games/,"['[deleted]', ""I do quite like action-RPGs generally, but actually loot is the one thing about them I really dislike. I enjoy stat-based progression systems, skill trees and abilities, exploration, environmental interactions, interesting enemy and encounter design, reactive real-time combat, story, and worldbuilding.\n\nI do not enjoy finding three helmets that give 132, 125, or 137 armor and +2 health regen, +28% fire resistance, or +12 defensive ability, and having to decide which of them to use or sell - my eyes glaze over and I sell everything until I get way bigger numbers than what I currently have, because I just don't care. I'm playing Titan Quest right now for the first time, and there's way too much of this.\n\nA few games that could be broadly considered action-RPGs where I've actually enjoyed the item/equipment systems are Bastion and Hyper Light Drifter. Individual items feel meaningfully distinct in those, and you can upgrade the items in predictable ways that have a clear impact, while still being constrained to a subset of possible upgrades so you're forced to make choices. I also enjoy Torchlight's pet system, since anything that gets the loot away from me faster is good.\n\nCrafting systems, while not my favourite, are more enjoyable in my book than randomized loot, since it's usually more deliberate and easier to work towards on purpose. This is something I do like in Titan Quest, actually - the charms you can add to your weapons for specific bonuses, and the artifacts you can craft from relics and charms, are a lot more fun to think about and plan out than the loot system itself.\n\nLong story short - does the game provide me with the resources to plan for what I want and make purposeful, incremental steps towards my goals while still feeling like each step is also a clear improvement in and of itself? Randomized loot usually clutters this experience by providing me with huge volumes of stuff I must first analyze and discard before I can engage with the progression systems."", 'So, I\'m a completely different type of player than you, so my opinion might not be relevant if you\'re just not planning to cater to my demographic, but here\'s a few thoughts:\n\nThere\'s a very fine line between being happy about finding a great piece of loot and grinding for a long time while not finding it and having no. way. whatsoever. to influence the result except for grinding even more. That\'s what people mean when they\'re talking about being at the mercy of RNGesus and it\'s utterly frustrating. Especially since you talk about deciding on a build and then looking to equip it or achieving 100% collection, as this is a situation all too common when looking for specific pieces. Do you plan on mitigating this frustration (maybe by other ways to get equipment, such as crafting/recycling) or would you rather try and tweak the drop rates to find the right balance?\n\nSince you\'re talking about 100% collection, how does this interact with randomised loot? Are you planning on designing all equipment pieces by hand, go for all random or combine them by designing uniques per hand and randomising other loot (like most games these days do)? And which of these would then be required for 100% collection? I really enjoy checklists, but basing a checklist purely on random chance sounds frustrating to me. \n\nHow do you feel about players who play the opposite way from yours - building their character around the loot they find? This usually isn\'t a very end-game approach, but to get to a skill level where you can figure out a build on the dry you usually have to play the game for a while. Do you want to focus on the late game experience, and how do you plan to get new players to care about your game, especially if you don\'t like stories?\n\nSpeaking of stories: I agree that a story can get in the way when you\'re starting the game over and over and have to do it every time. However it can be an important motivator when getting into the game and also serve to introduce new players to the world and your mechanics. Furthermore it\'s an important tool to familiarise the player with the setting and style of teh game, and style is really important in loot-focused games. I\'d consider having a story mode and a kind of NG+ mode that lets you just grind while skipping all the dialogue, cutscenes and questing. I\'d also consider giving each character (if you\'re doing classes) their own campaign, which can then be very short but it motivates players to try out each class. [This video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zQgw_rKWT8)talks about doing that at some point, but I can\'t remember the timestamp and it\'s really long, sorry. \n\nWhat about the moment to moment gameplay? Especially when you have to grind a lot it\'s really important to have viscerally satisfying and flashy gameplay. Warframe is really good at that, but even that game can get frustrating running the same mission time and again in the hopes of getting the drop you need, especially with its fractal grinds. You really need responsive controls, good sounds and effects and a weighty, meaty combat system to keep me playing for hours for loot. Loot is nice, but if the grinding turns into unpleasant work it\'s not worth the time. \n\nLastly a legitimate question: What exactly do you mean when you\'re talking about a ""deep"" loot system? ', ""I want an engaging world/effectively conveyed atmosphere, good game feel, interesting loot, deep variety for building characters. Story isn't important but the environments still have to pull you in. Diablo 2's Kurast jungle, Arrat Highlands, Lit Gholein - all very atmospheric areas.\n\nThe loot isn't as important to me in borderlands but I won't play a diablo styled arpg for long if all the items are just +stats with no interesting synergies to build off or modification of normal attack mechanics.\n\nI like to play these games in single player and build up a collection of items. For most these games I've downloaded stash enhancement or item management add-ons. I don't like trading with other players especially if it's old school WTB or N a O b spam."", 'RNGesus', ""Like:    \n-Can play at my own pace.    \n-Sense of accomplishment.    \n-When the drop rates/crafting is done correctly, it keeps me hooked indefinitely.\n\nDislike:    \n-Sometimes there's areas I'm not that interested in (like Act III of Diablo 2), but you have to run them just as much as the other areas.    \n-I love Warframe to death, but the early game gives you almost no explanation of where to find items/mats.  Diablo also had this, but it usually gave you good enough items just from random drops to get through Normal and Nightmare.  You didn't have to start focusing on crafting until Act V Nightmare/Act I Hell.  In Warframe, you get to the third planet and already you need to start upgrading your frame/weapons.  And all the blueprints I had required items that were in later planets or SUPER rare drops on Earth."", ""Replay-ability is the number one thing I look for in a loot driven RPG. That being said, the easiest way to introduce that feature is by adding multiplayer. Showing off a game to a friend that you can mindlessly play with is really enjoyable. \n\nI personally like challenging games where the mechanics are obtuse enough that you get a little frustrated but not so much that you want to rip your monitor in half. I never like feeling frustrated on mechanics that are poorly written. In Path of Exile (PoE) for the longest time I didn't know if Critical Multiplier meant Crit Chance multiplier or a multiplier on the crit damage. Wolcen also has a weird way of stating critical damage and critical chance. \n\nMy best advice I can give as a player is make the stats, debuffs, and buffs CRYSTAL CLEAR on how they affect your player character and the enemies. But, make finding the items as obtuse as possible. Dropping hints to the community that there are still recipes that have yet to be unlocked or not all Unique items have been picked up. I don't care about the story, but there are people that will get attached to what characters say and do in game. "", 'If I may make a suggestion regarding 100% item completion. Rather than grind for every item in a set and leaving it all to randomness, why not randomness + quest/task/etc.? \n\nTo elaborate: let’s say I want to complete a 5-item set. I’ve managed to get all but the headpiece. At this point, I’ve “unlocked” a task or quest (that is suitably challenging) to get the headpiece and complete the set. It could be defeating a unique boss or completing a god quest, for example. Perhaps a quest involving choice and consequences, e.g. Ares wants me to slaughter a small village to get the headpiece. So now I have a choice: slaughter the village to get it, or grind. ', ""I usually enjoy loot-based games for the first few hours, but then they quickly grow boring to me. First of all, when you begin, every item you find is good - is often an upgrade over what you had in the beginning. This is nice and fun. But after you gather an initial good set of items, upgrades become rare and uncertain. This new sword offers more damage, but less crits... Should I take, or not? Bah, I **don't** want to think about it... Another problem is that most loot-based games tend to have action combat, and I don't like that, I'm turn-based combat fan, and prefer set-pieces complex combats to mowing down random groups of trash mobs.\n\nIt's much better when loot-based game is not an RPG, or, rather, not Diablo-like, and offers a different gameplay. For example, scroll shooter called [Drifting Lands](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322750/Drifting_Lands/) is a very good example of a loot-based game with some RPG elements, but much more fun (to me) gameplay.\n\nWhat really annoys me is that I'm not *entirely* hate the idea of such games. My gameplay preferences intersect with the target audience of Diablo clones just enough that I want to play such games sometimes, but end up disliking them in the end, because combat is boring and story is shallow or non-existent. I love collecting stuff, but I hate action combat. Also, I don't like thinking about builds - I usually just pick whatever items I think are the most powerful, without thinking very much about their synergy, or grinding for the perfect item to complete the set."", 'The most specific part of those games I dislike is when I play online I have to compete with party members for loot.\n\nOddly specific, I know, but it seems to encourage *not* playing multiplayer.']"

To have the same impact as PS:T, a new game has to push the storytelling boundaries beyond today\'s state of the art by the same amount that PS:T pushed them beyond the state of the art in 1999.

rpg_gamers,t3_954rhl,"Ogre Battle and Randomness in RPGsHello every folks! 

So question for ya. Ogre Battle. It's not a question, it's a great series, actually.

Point being, the first couple of them, and the 3 others, to some degree, had a pretty darn unique take on applying randomness to a game.

Essentially instead of random levels or whatnot, they implemented a system where all items and advanced classes were more or less randomized every time You went through. In this way, even when You knew them well enough to do runs, it might well be worth Your time to try and take that one island that's out of the way, it might just have a healing leaf, or it might have the Ogre Blade.

Actually, this led to some pretty funny scenarios for head canon. For example, in my last run, I found the Ogre Blade sitting around in a random church, they're just like ""Oh hey, we have this crazy powerful demon sword, I guess this thing doesn't quite mesh with our decor, You want it?""

Or how we got a Lich and Princess from random drops, the two most powerful classes, who were able to go from two completely worthless spellcasters to God-Tier absurdity in an instant. 

It's funny, because this creates a whole new game from the same scenario each time. I was playing the SNES and PS1 versions side by side, and the PS1 version was this long, epic struggle of lots of hardened soldiers against a massive, varied army of super beasts. The SNES run consisted of a Metal Singer, a Zombie, and a Princess heading swarms of fairies in a massive purge off all life in the continent.

So what do You think of all this, do You know of any other games that did this kind of system? Have You tried this for Yourself, got any interesting stories out of it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/954rhl/ogre_battle_and_randomness_in_rpgs/,"['Wow, mega nostalgia I forgot about this game.

* Save whenever possible.

* Make sure your equipment and items are always at their best and in stock.

rpg_gamers,t3_950sow,"Please recommend me a good oldschool RPG game.Hi all.

I am an oldschool RPG gamer, love all the old games however recently I am in the mood to play something new.

I have finished multiple times all the old classics like Fallout games, Baldurs Gate series, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter nights etc. and looking for something similar but a modern game.

Recently I have finished Tides of Numenera and Tyranny. I liked both games , Tides was not so bad as other said and I kinda liked it. Especially the aesthetics and visuals and the music. 

I liked Tyranny a lot. I could say maybe a little bit more than Pillars of Eternity ( storywise ). Gameplay wise I think I enjoyed PoE more but only by a tiny bit.

Divinity Original Sin never hooked me in, but that is probably because I was playing in a group and it was ridiculously hard and frustrating. My friend chose to play the Lone Wolf build and went with a 2 man group and he cheesed through everything with ease but said that the story wasn't great and if he knew the game will be like this he would not play it. Even after my 2nd attempt, I just could not finish this game because it was kinda meh ( not appealing story and character build ). So I am not sure if looking at Original Sin 2 is correct ?

I know that there are other RPG games out there as well, but I hate JRPGs for the anime look and I never really got in to Witcher.  

Except Pillars of Eternity 2 , what else is there left in this genre ?

rpg_gamers,t3_94ara1,"Would you play an RPG that explicitly encourages Metagaming on multiple play-thrus?So many of us play an RPG we enjoy two or more times, usually in an effort to acquire or achieve things we didn't know about or failed in preceding play-thrus, or maybe even to speed-run or crank the difficulty as a challenge. 

What I think would be interesting, but what I haven't seen done very often, would be an RPG that changes based on what you've done in previous save games, and offers you a New Game+ type Metagaming experience. 

Basically, your first run would be totally blind: your perspective is from the character only, and you only have access to in-game knowledge that your character has. 

Subsequent runs, however, could adjust the world based on player knowledge of certain hidden items, secret meetings, or unmarked quests. Sort of like a ""radiant"" quest system, but one that deliberately breaks the fourth wall to engage the player personally rather than the character. The game could mine this data from previous saves. 

An in-game example could be at some point early in the game, an npc asks your character if they'd seen some item or know some character. First run: no, who/what do you mean? -&gt; quest given. Second run: yes, I know who/what you mean -&gt; quest given, quest adjusted to be more difficult/interesting as a result. 

Could work with a lot of things, from dialogue to quests to character interactions and hidden items.

Thoughts?

Tl;Dr - a game where your first run relies SOLELY on the player character's knowledge and experience, a proper role play. Subsequent runs would or could be made to adapt the narrative of the story from the PLAYER'S perspective, and all the game knowledge they've acquired.

- how's the level scaling in F4? Do you feel stronger as you level up your character, or it's actually the opposite? I mean, in Oblivion, which was the last Bethesda's RPG I've played, the more 'stronger' I've got, the harder was to kill enemies due to their higher levels and new skills. How's this in Fallout? Is the level scaling there so bad?


- how are fps drops on a 'normal' PS 4? Do fps drop bellow 30 often? Is it mostly playable, or a lot of times a slide show?


- how large is the map with all the DLCs?

It made me realise I really love RPGs with a small, highly detailed, handcrafted world.  Games like those mentioned above (maybe not Phantasie 3...) and Quest for Glory 1, etc.   Where the entire game map is small enough to keep track of in your head, where there are only a few characters but each one is unique, where items are unique and placed in significant locations.  Where subquests aren't a big part of the game, instead you're mostly just playing through the game linearly.


It feels like this sort of game has mostly died out, and most WRPGs instead follow in the tradition where they try to outcompete each other in how big their game world can be, and how many hours of gameplay they offer, how much choices and subquests etc.  Even if the content becomes bland and procedural.


Have there been any recent games that are just set in a single town, single dungeon, single area?

rpg_gamers,t3_93qt0o,"(POLL) Concepts for an Indie Game DeveloperHey, All. It’s me again. 

While pondering a few ideas for a Webtoons comic, I also wanted to test out the water to see what kind of indie game my fellow gamers would be most interested in for this next generation of consoles and computers. Keep in mind, these are all just raw concepts, and are subject to change over the years. I’m mostly listing the basic mechanics and some thematic elements as well. There will also be a poll underneath from which you can pick one or multiple concepts that appeal to you, or even if you’d want to voice some ideas of your own. 

I understand that some people might find this to be jumping the gun a bit, but I wouldn’t want to be going full throttle into any of these concepts only to find that after years of development, nobody would even WANT to play the game I’d be working on. So yes, it’s a bit raw, but I am more than willing to cook up a well done experience if I’m given the right direction. Any and all feedback is welcome, thank you.

So here are the concepts that I have in mind so far: 

Thorn, Dark Fantasy Open World RPG. Traverse a perilous open world with multiple pathways and obscure worlds fused together by a dark curse. Throughout this vast world, you have but one save point: a giant black thorn that can be summoned from anywhere, and from which you are respawned once you are killed. After absorbing wayward souls to join you party, you are capable of switching between party members in real time to help explore the world map in new ways and discover new pathways. Fend against enemies and bosses with multiple combinations of attacks via the members of your party and their versatile options of weaponry to be upgraded as you see fit. (Influences: Demon’s Souls, Undungeon, Hyper Light Drifter, Indivisible, Transistor)

Soiron, Cooking World Action RPG. To find an antidote for the mass plague spreading across the land, solve ominous food-themed puzzles in the overworld while fending against zombie-like enemies via a secluded iron chef themed battle field. Harvest ingredients across the world to whip together a dish powerful enough to lay your enemies to rest. Party members, functioning as your sous chefs, help you locate special herbs and spices within the battle zone while discovering which combination of spices will help destroy your enemies, as well as bosses with some strange tastes and even stranger weak points. (Influences: Battle Chef Brigade, League of Legends, Pyre, Saltenpepper)

Ride4Life, Cyberpunk Racing RPG. Traverse through a perilous and mesmerizing futuristic world on the brink of collapse via multiple forms of gameplay, including maddening track racing, sumo-esque vehicular combat, and open world exploration. As your road grows longer, your bond with your car grows stronger, along with the spirit medium of your vehicle as well. Stronger bonds allow for more slots to upgrade and swap out vehicle parts for enhanced combat and maneuvering. In terms of a party system, there’s the addition of interchangeable copilots for different attacks and buffs, along with enhanced character interactions. (Influences: Mario Kart, Shadowrun, Banjo Kazooie Nuts N Bolts, REDLINE)

Kiton’s Keep, Underground Side Scroller RPG. When a mystic castle filled with strange magic and riches is revealed to be buried whole beneath a great mountain, you set out to traverse the dark halls with naught but your faithful grappling hook. Along the way, you may encounter fellow explorers, several of whom could trade riches with you or give you special upgrades to your gun for offensive and defensive abilities. The further towards the keep you get, the more violent your adversaries and the more obscure your sense of direction becomes; all you can rely on is your safety line to your trusty airship, your ever-floating hub of the game. (Influences: Sperlunky, Bastion, La Mulana, Salt and Sanctuary)

Wings of Blight, Bug Kingdom Turn Based RPG. A Bee Knight with a clipped antennae sets out to remedy the blight that is killing the forest home of her people, despite being exiled by them. Fend off agains the vile and insane alike within the insect kingdom with the help of some strange bug companions that come your way with each region of the forest you explore. With the aid of action commands and an intricate initiative bar below the screen, players can execute special attacks with various button combinations to constantly be kept on their toes. Gameplay outside of combat also aims to be rewarding, with a sprawling overworld loaded grand puzzles and quests to help build the world of this stranded bee, her whimsical party, and her crumbling home. (Influences: Paper Mario, Child of Light, Dragon Quest, Hollow Knight)

Dominus, Animal Kingdom Tactical RPG. Having been resurrected after the betrayal of your former commander, you must succeed him as the leader of a legion bent on world conquest. Recruit diplomats to assist you and open up a plethora of options to conquer your enemies, harvest your resources and reap greater riches. Fend against powerful adversaries either through diplomacy, bribery, or if necessary brute force. Gameplay systems transition smoothly between an isometric exploration mode and a map-based campaign mode, both featuring multiple options for communication and combat. (Influences: Tyranny, Fallout New Vegas, Dragon Age Inquisition, Tooth and Tail)

Again, thanks very much for taking a few minutes of your time to humor me and my ideas. Any and all feedback is most welcome and will be of great assistance in helping me flesh out something I can enjoy working on and hopefully create for you guys to enjoy as well :)

rpg_gamers,t3_93owwx,"Final Fantasy Tactics: WotL questionsI have several questions about FFT:

Which version is the best?

I suppose War of the Lions is better than the FFTA2 version.

But which platform is better? I have found the UI unconvincing on the Android version. Is any of the emulated version better?

Should I delay ending a battle until every downed opponent countdown reach zero (in order to get chests/crystals), or are there benefits to ending battles faster?

Actually, is there a downside to taking crystals?

Are some Zodiac Signs more useful than others?

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/93owwx/final_fantasy_tactics_wotl_questions/,"[""Best platform might be the the Android because it has the slowdown bug fixed (a bug where the game slows down while using certain skills in battle), although apparently you can fix that if you're running CFW on your PSP.\n\nFFT War of the Lions and FFTA2 are completely different games.\n\nSure, delay ending battles if you want to collect chests/crystals.  But  the rewards are random, and generally in vanilla FFT I found most of the time they gave shitty rewards.  IIRC you get a list of skills that pop up, but you actually end up getting all of them.  But no, no downside to taking crystals.  And you should always take em otherwise the enemies will.\n\nSome Zodiac Signs are more useful, mostly for Ramza.  In certain battles he's alone, so having the right sign can help...kind of.  It's not really a make or break thing and you probably shouldn't worry about it too much."", 'Android version is good once you get used to the touch controls, otherwise the patched version for PSP/Vita with CFW (or emulated with ppsspp), since it also has multiplayer.\n\nWotL and FFTA2 is a different game. WotL is a remaster of FFT for PSX.\n\nThe crystals give you abilities at random, those abilities can be acquired by grinding anyway. The only upside to delay a battle is to grind but that can be boring in the long run (unless you like that).\n\n\nThere is a tutorial regarding the Zodiac Signs, some Zodiac signs are more compatible within each other than the rest. It helps mostly with the success percentage off your mages. For example, if your mage casting raise is compatible with the downed unit, it will have 100% success rate, otherwise it may fall up to 50%. Items are not affected by zodiac sign.', 'I wouldn\'t worry about Zodiac signs.  Compatible / Opposing signs can have greater or lesser effects with stuff like spell casting and chance to steal, but it\'s not enough to really worry about.\n\nMy favorite version is the original PS1 version.  It still has the JP bug where you can skip grinding out all the JP to unlock abilities - especially useful for classes like Black Mage.  It also doesn\'t have the slow-down bug.  The slowdown bug can be mitigated if you play on an emulated PSP version with a fast-forward option (R2 for me when I play with my xBox controller).  \n\nFFTA2 is a totally different game and utter garbage in my opinion.  In fact, FFTA is a totally different game from FFT: WotL.\n\nCrystals aren\'t that important.  You can unlock some skills without JP or refill your hp/mp with them, so that\'s nice.  The items are pretty bland most of the time.  More importantly however is the ability called ""Move-Find Item.""  Each map has some squares with items on them.  One Common item and one rare item.  Here\'s the catch though, if you step on that square with this ability unlocked and you get the ""common"" item, that\'s it.  You can\'t keep trying for the rare item.  Here\'s what\'s important, the LOWER your ""Brave"" stat, the higher your chance of getting the rare item.  That\'s why Rapha is an important character, as she has the lowest starting bravery stat in the game.\n\nWar of the Lion does have some nice new characters, features, and a much improved translation.  Anyway, this is one of my favorite games of all-time, so let me know if you have any other questions.']"

Here's an example.

* **Dead Cells | PC** - Still playing this, so same from last week.  I think most people know this game.  It's a rougelike / rougelite metroidvania style game and it is amazing.  Soon to go up in price around August 5th so now is a great time to pick it up!..its a bit of a stretch from RPG but I'd still count it in.
* **Bravely Default** - really enjoying this game on the 3ds.  I prefer being able to move around in the turn based combat but this is still really well done.  I enjoy the Job system, only played about 2-3 hours into it.  Writing seems a step above the average RPG :)
*  **Idle RPG | discord channel** - still playing from last week.  I finally beat Rems in a duel!

What are you guys/gals playing?

",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/93o6co/what_have_you_been_playing_wednesday_a_weekly/,"['* **Octopath Traveler**:  It\'s a pretty workmanlike game so far (up to chapter 2). Not terribly imaginative or compelling, but well-executed, which TBH is far more than I expect out of Square-Enix. I\'m not sure it\'ll hold my interest long enough to finish considering Dragon Quest XI and SenIV are right around the corner, though.\n* **Ys VIII Lacrimosa of Dana**: I started playing on the 24th and am already up to chpater 5. Gameplay-wise it\'s maybe not the best Ys game (TBH I think the top-down games are far superior when it comes to combat) but the storytelling is generally pretty good (though chapter 2 was awful and the absence of any antagonist is keenly felt). The basic premise does feel like a bit of a let-down, I guess, considering it\'s basically the same as Ark of Napishtim, only without any of the cooler elements (like the competing colonies of castaways, the giant maelstrom). It feels like maybe the whole ""castaway village"" mechanics might have been better suited for an Ys VI remake. That said, everything about Dana is fantastic and I love it, especially her theme music.\n* **Pillars of Eternity II Deadfire**: it\'s slow-going still. Have a feeling I should just ditch the game \'till all the DLC is out, because the expansions are all sideloaded and they keep adding early-game crap  via updates that makes me feel like I\'m missing out.\n* **Disgaeas!** Grabbed Disgaea 5 on Switch last month, stopped playing when Octopath came out, and ended up replaying Disgaea 3 on Vita instead. Got to the postgame pretty quickly and am now debating just how much I want to powerlevel before setting it aside, probably forever.', 'Darkest Dungeon - I\'ve completed the game on it\'s ""hard"" difficulty, and unlocked the ""Stygian"" difficulty.  I\'ve already lost one Stygian game (it will give you the ol\' ""Game Over"" if you lose too many characters). Now I\'m on week 32 and barely hanging on.  \n\nThe writing is superb!  The art style is excellent.  The Character classes and leveling are balanced and well thought out.  The prep time for a dungeon run is a bit tedious though.  9/10 would recommend.', 'Lufia II- A pretty straightforward RPG with some really fun wrinkles to it (read: Capsule Monsters)  to offset some of the broken mechanics. Likable if flimsy characters, and one of the greatest minigames (sub-games?) of all time.', '**Chrono Trigger**- I got this in the post today. Currently exploring the Millennial Fair. \n\nThe art style makes me want to play the Dragon Quest games. ', ""**Forgotten City (Skyrim)** - heard a lot of good about this mod for Skyrim. I had some old save with a low level character so I did some of the main quest (got 2nd word of FusRoDah) and jumped right into this module on level 6. Might be too low. Anyway, it's mostly a story module and it has a very interesting premise. It's actually more of an adventure game inserted in the RPG engine. There are some skillcheks for persuasion but I suspect you can't ever fail them because I had low speech and still succeeded. Makes me want to play a real dialogue/mystery oriented game. You rarely see those nowadays, maybe recent Sexy Brutale which is similar to this mod in many ways."", 'Lemme know if you’ve got any questions later. I’ll happily talk your ear off about RPGs.', 'Suikoden- I started playing this after watching a YouTuber doing a let’s play of the later versions. I’m playing it on the vita and I must say it is enjoyable, especially for its age (originally on the ps1). It looks great handheld and the character development seems to be on par with other suikoden games.\n\nOctopath traveler-just picked this up a couple days ago and like where it is going so far. I’m only on the ch 1 parts but it’s nice that they are a quick play, adding to the on-the-go benefits of the switch.\n', ""I have little time or energy atm, so it's just **Dark Quest 2** for a half hour here and there. It's a fun turned based rpg-lite, similar to the Hero Quest board game. I like that it's fast paced, with ok graphics, and turn based combat that doesn't become a slog and fun &amp; powerful character abilities. Not a lot of story, but I wasn't looking for that anyway. Will definitely play it to completion."", 'I’ve been on an RPG spree. Currently playing through the Mass Effect trilogy (on ME2 right now), Wasteland 2, PoE, Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen, and my 6th playthrough of Skyrim. \n\nPlanning on starting Torment: Tides of Numenera, Risen 3, Underrail, and Age of Decadence as soon as I shave off half the games above. Taking advantage of the lax release schedule during the summer to complete all these games. Difficult while balancing college and social life.', '**Cryptic Conjure | PC (for now):** Seems like an interesting game. Currently has a pre-sale out now and news about releasing a demo playable soon. The game is built with Unreal Engine 4 using the Ethereum blockchain which is pretty interesting. They released a trailer so far on their website, following them on Discord and Telegram on any new updates. ', ""**Underrail |** - Excellent tactical turn-based CRPG that has gone severely under the radar of most gamers. Post-Apocalypic sci-fi setting with some real Fallout 2 vibes I'm about 15 hours in so far and it's been an absolute joy to play.  \n  \n**Pillars of Eternity 2 - Beasts of Winter DLC |** - DLC for the best RPG of the year so far. It was really good, if a bit short. If you loved POE2 and really are itching for some more I'd say it's worth picking up, but expect to really only put maybe 4-8 hours into it. But for me, at least, it's just inspired me to start a new game with a completely different character archetype and I'm loving it all over again like it's the very first time.  \n  \n**Balrum |** - Another excellent indie CRPG that hasn't gotten enough love. It's a bit slow to get into, but the dialog is compelling and draws you in, even if it starts out feeling a bit trope-y. If you're a fan of any Spiderweb Software games, especially the Avadon series, you should think about picking this one up.""]"

rpg_gamers,t3_93iuf3,"Isometric Western RPGs on console: Difficult?Hey everyone, I just had to ask this before spending $$. I've always played games mixed between PC and Console. It always depends on what stage of life my PC is in. Currently ""Decrepit"" would be a suitable term.

Games like fallout 1&amp;2, Baldurs Gate series, etc I've always played on pc. Unfortunately its still a ways off on upgrading my laptop so I cant really run a whole lot. 

Does anyone here play games like Pillars of Eternity, or Divinity on console?  Im weary of something that usually relies so hevily on mouse actions. I thought that of Diablo 3 however and it ended up great, but it can be a bit more intense real time hack n slash, rather than watch, issue commands, check inventory, click this click that.

Seeing as my ps4 is kind of my center stage atm, do these games play well with a controller? Or should i hold out for PC? Mods dont interest me for these types of games. So that wont influence the decision. 

Edit: tl;dr isometric rpgs with a controller vs a mouse &amp; keyboard. Comfortable or a PitA?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/93iuf3/isometric_western_rpgs_on_console_difficult/,"['RTw/P absolutely does not work with a gamepad. So I would strongly caution against Pillars of Eternity on console, unless you\'re willing to play on the easiest difficulty (which IIRC is basically just a ""story only"" mode that reduces combat to minor roadbloacks between point A and point B).\n\nDivinity Original Sin is a brilliant game, and turn-based, so it works very well w/ a gamepad. Be warned that the PS4 version of the first game, at least, has some very serious bugs that Larian has zero intention of fixing. I\'m not aware of anything game-breaking, but it is possible for companions to permanently die, which can break certain quests and associated trophies. \n\n(Inventory management is still a bit of a hassle, but in general Divinity doesn\'t throw as much garbage loot at you as Pillars or Diablo, so it\'s not a huge deal. I played extensively on both PC--original release--and PS4--enhanced edition--and found that using a gamepad generally made UI navigation take 3-4 seconds longer on average, once I became accustomed to the controls.\n\nDOS2\'s console port is a month away, and FWIW it may have more efficient gamepad UI. It\'s a much more complex and ambitious game, so unless you\'re principal draw here is the narrative (where DOS2 is insanely superior) I\'d recommend starting w/ DOS1 as it\'s much easier to wrap your head around.', 'I have Divinity, Torment, and Pillars on Xbox. They all play fine. The only thing I’ve run into it’s in Divinity it can be sometimes hard to put my attack down since the game tries to lock me onto a specific target which can be an issue if I’m trying to put an AOE attack down between two targets. Not really a big deal though since it’s turn based. Can’t think of a single issue pop up aside from that. Some long old times in Pillars I guess', 'Turn-based is fine. Real time with pause?

So why is baldurs gate not gripping me?I beat planescape torment last year, since then, I beat it once more and It has since become one of my favourite games of all time. The same can be said for Pillars of eternity, which, funnily enough, is just below planescape torment for me on just how much I enjoyed it. Both of these CRPG are extremely fun for me, they drew me into the genre and helped broaden my horizons when it came to rpg videogames.  


So why can't i bring myself to enjoy baldurs gate? I've been playing for a solid five hours now, and thus far nothing has gripped me, if anything the whole mystery surrounding the main characters origins is more of a turn off than anything, since it's kind of obvious from the word go how this is going to turn out even if there is a whole song and dance about the subject. The combat is what I've come to expect from a CRPG, dull at the beginning, but gets much better as you progress, so I can deal with that just fine. If I had to guess what's annoying me it would be the dialog options, it's so...limited, in comparison to planescape torment. 

I've had friends tell me baldurs gate is better than planescape, and people lord baldurs gate as 'the best PC title of all time'. But i'm...not seeing it. Is this one of those slow burners that take a while to get better? Five hours, eight, ten, fifteen?

rpg_gamers,t3_92goj6,"Who Here Has Played Ogre Battle or Tactics Ogre?So for those unfamiliar, it goes a little like this:

You've probably heard of Final Fantasy Tactics. 

That game, and those that came from it are a direct result of the Ogre Battle Series.

But what the Hell is an Ogre Battle??

Long story short, before Matsuno could print money from anything he could put his name on, he was told to make an RTS game to try and compete with the others out there, namely CnC and Starcraft. Well, what resulted was a bit of an oddball going by the name of Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen, Ogre Battle Saga Episode 5. This game was amazing, taking a very unusually liberal, but down to earth take on the fantasy genre, and mixing it with a hybrid turn-based and real time system.                                 

You would make squads of up to 5 units, and send them to towns, who could then be liberated, at which time they may give You an item, and allow You to draw a card, which will randomly affect things on the map, such as time of day, character stats, and peoples' opinion of your army. The goal was to take the capital of each map while trying to retain good relations with the locals, and doing Your best to raise an army that could respond to a lot of situations, and local needs.                 

This means that a character generally viewed as lawful (High Alignment) will do well in similarly aligned cities, but would cause people to be upset if You sent them to a chaotic city. Additionally, Your alignment and charisma (which determines how much You can make people like You) would go down if You only had a strong squad fight a weaker one, forcing You to use weaker units to keep Your reputation high.                  

While technically bottoming out Your reputation didn't end the game, locals will usually not even try to help, You were locked out of the best endings, and a lot of the optional side content was closed off, since people were just terrified of You being there.                                      

OK, so far this sounds absolutely nothing like Final Fantasy Tactics, right? Have You been duped, is the author drunk? I assure You, we're getting there.                 

So MOTBQ went over surprisingly well, selling successfully, and a sequel was going to be made. The devs decided to go for a more intimate look at the morality mechanics this time, placing the story in the middle of a power struggle between several disgruntled nations, and introducing a perma-death mechanic, where all of Your units would be entirely dead if their health bottomed out. This meant that even Your best and favorite characters were very possibly going to be demoted to a hole in the ground well before their time, because such is the chaos of war. Let us Cling together came after Fire Emblem in terms of this mechanic, but I personally always felt the losses in TO more. The characters just seemed like they had always drawn the short straw, and everyone was trying to get by. There weren't the usual folks out to prove themselves in the most dangerous manner possible, these were soldiers trying to feed themselves and not die.

Now while MOTBQ had a lot of classes to go around, LUCT had even more, and even different genders had different classes available. This game was incredibly written...mostly. See...the translation wasn't the greatest, and is actually one of the reasons this series still sits in the collective gutter of our medium. Back when LUCT first came out, it was only on the SNES, and was very well received for both it's story and gameplay (We'll get to that in a moment), but the English version couldn't be shipped until it came to the PS1, and unfortunately, it could come out after Final Fantasy Tactics.         

Let's take a minute to discuss gameplay, because this is where it may start to look familiar. You could have up to 30 units, with 8 units deployed at once. These ranged from several human classes of various types, dragons, golems, griffins, fairies, angels, etc. You could equip 4 items per character, plus they had 4 skills. Usually these skills were a spellbook, but some had built in abilities, such as throwing a rock fast enough to damage, or special moves that could be learned later in the game. Any character could equip almost any gear, so if You wanted a crossbow wizard, that was completely fair game. Usually ranged and caster characters tended to dominate the late game, though. Additionally, characters were affected by terrain, which may reduce or improve accuracy, alter their movement range, and based off of their element, may give bonus or minus damage to certain moves.      

If Story was Your thing, this was one of the first games to employ an adaptive storyline, with multiple large branches, and adjustments based on who lived or died up to that point. Even who came to what battle could affect what ultimately happened.                      

If You're anything like me, this all sounds amazing, right? Any class, any item, terrain matters, it's a whole lot, expecially for a SNES game.                  

This is where that translation comes in.               

Funny thing is...FFT was actually supposed to be the sequel to LUCT. While the first two games were successes, FFT had the Final Fantasy name, and was seen as a way for the FF series to get into the strategy market. As a result, Matsuno took what was supposed to be Episode 8, the finale of the series, and stripped away a lot of the TO features to make the FFT we know and love.                    

Far fewer units could be deployed, but each unit was, in essence, two classes, plus change. There was no longer a branching or adaptive storyline, but we did get a really freeform skill system, which he'd been wanting to implement for a while. Overall, the freedom employed allowed for a very well received title, but doomed the original LUCT, which was released to late reviews of ""This is a ripoff of FFT, how dare they""....despite being made by the same people and coming first.                      

Anyhow, this was not the end of the series! Next we had Ogre Battle 64. Presumably being burned by what FFT did, efforts were directed to make an Ogre Battle sequel like the original, with improved and expanded mechanics. This quickly became a fan favorite, boasting lots of improved character interactivity (Such as a clay golem turning to a stone golem permanently and becoming immune to petrification when petrified), new classes, and a better explained morality mechanic, on top of more interesting class promotion mechanics mixed with equipment customization for all 100 of Your army.                   

As amazing as this game was, it has had a hard time breaking into modern nostalgia markets, due to the N64 being a pain to emulate. Other than that, this game is long overdue for a sequel, spiritual or otherwise.         

With the success of OB64, they felt that it was time to give Tactics Ogre another shot, and did so, in the form of the incredible Knight of Lodis for the GBA. While this did run slower than many other strategy games, it included the same in-depth mechnics of LUCT, with the addition of an Emblem mechanic, which were tiny awards and promotions that allowed for really interesting and organic unit growth.               

This meant, for example, that a Soldier could become a Knight if he received his Knight's Certificate from attacking head on repeatedly during a battle. They could unlock the Swordmaster by evading or blocking 3 hits in a row. They could become a Valkyrie from hitting two enemies with one spear attack, etc. Two of the classes even required dying under very specific circumstances, so there was a lot of fun to be had with the class mechanics alone.            

If that wasn't enough, this also had an adaptive storyline, although on a much smaller scale, and arguably had the best overall balance of the series. The music wasn't great, but there's still some good tracks in there.              

Finally, we get to the PSP remake. This was the biggest and best labor of love from a dev I've seen since everything CD Project Red has done. This remake was an attempt to fully realize the potential that LUCT had, and bring it into the Western market, presumably hoping to replace FFT as the strategy game of choice.                     

They went heavily into listening to fans for this one, even addressing little dialogue choices that people felt were missing. Unfortunately, the fact that FF11 had gotten popular around this point meant that the game was also either pressured to, or felt optomistic about copying the MMO mechanics that had been used. Bear in mind this is not an MMO, and adding long grinds to improve skills or get items, which could then fail while crafting was something that absolutely no one liked.

Let me clarify, this is one of my favorite games ever, I have spent nearly a decade playing it, but it had some outlandishly bad balance at times. Archers and Ninjas in particular were notable for getting several hidden, background bonuses that allowed them to dominate most of the game with no contest. There were a lot of fun mechanics, but just as many broken or boring ones, such as half of most skill trees being variants of 10-40% buffs to different stats.         

So that doesn't paint a very positive picture, now does it? They tried to remake LUCT using the systems people loved from FFT, but wound up with a watered down skill system on an amazingly pretty, well-written and incredibly immersive game.    

Don't get me wrong, this game was incredibly fun, the plot was well written, but everything was kind of incongruous. The story talked about death and war, loss of friends, but gave You options for reviving units, plus they had multiple lives, plus they had a bleedout counter, like FFT. This was especially jarring when the main character sees the transformation of a unit from person to undead to angel knight, commenting about how it was possible to come back from the Dead. There is an uncommon item for coming back from the dead, plus every shop carries blessing stones for revival, this was nothing amazing.                

There was a lot of equipment, but  every class had an eventual optimal setup, meaning that most of the options out there either were either disappointing or didn't seem practical. A good example was 2H swords. On paper, You'd think they were the power counterpart to 2h swords. In reality, they are the lightweight variant, since a sword and board setup is heavier by a little bit, and end game armor becomes more of a burden than a help. 2 Handed bows, Katanas, and Daggers all received bonuses that meant a knife could easily overpower a Claymore with very little effort.       

Classes had some interesting mechanics, but again, seemed to have a lot of things thrown together to fill the slots at the last second, such as one character's ability to know how many skill points someone has used, or another who can...read the weather....As in they have the ability to look and see if the weather gives a +1 or a +5 to an element, an increment so tiny it would never matter.         

So why am I harping on about a game I love to death? Well, there was a mod that was released last year to fix all that, and create, in my opinion, the hands-down best strategy RPG out there. I am talking, of course, about One Vision.          

This is a mod that originally started out with just the intention to rebalance Finishers, a set of skills most characters have which allow them to do one powerful attack. To say these were slightly imbalanced is an understatement, when the very first one crossbow users get is one of the most powerful moves in the game, an AoE explosion that ignores terrain (They bought the pre-order Grenade Launcher Attachment pack, obviously). So he redid those first....then went onto weapons...then classes...items...and on and on for about 2 years.               

So now here's a game where every single class can stand on more or less equal ground in terms of usefulness, while all being fun to use (which seems impossibly until You dig into it.). Every single weapon and armor has a job, and does it well. Every single skill has a use, even if it may be unclear at first. For example a basic soldier gets Mighty Strike, a 100% hit chance, 100% crit. Very useful. A spellblade, on the other hand, can buff a 5 tile area with 100%. While on paper these seem similar, the soldier is built for damage and weapon variety, so he hits harder. The spellblade not only boosts accuracy, but this 100% hit chance also means the secondary effect most weapons have will also hit every time (Normally 10-25%. The Warlock has a move to push a unit away at a distance. This seems worthless until You see that You can now push units into position for combos, Into The Breach style, or use this Mindblast and a shield to push a unit two tiles and off a cliff. Some units even have the ability to throw items built into their class, but almost anyone can be given an item Lobber for a makeshift Chemist.                         

Ultimately, this makes LUCT into a game with an incredible story, nice style, beautiful music, content that I am still digging into almost 10 years later, near perfect balance, and finally, my favorite thing, a situation where generic units actually have stats as good as Your unique ones, so having a unique costume no longer makes someone into a god amongst men.                     

If You are a fan of Strategy games, SRPGs, RPGs, any of it, do Yourself a favor and try this thing out. You will absolutely not regret it.

Still, I figure it's been enough time for people to have formed their opinions of the game. There was a lot of expectation for the game before it came out. Do you think the game delivered?

I also remember people comparing the Pillars series to the Baldur's Gate series, and postulating that the second game will be even better than the first (just like it was for BG). Has this been the case?

The boat combat itself was good, it just wasn\'t implement very well, which gave you few opportunities to really put it to good use (you see some decent examples of what it could have been at the end of the game). That turned the whole ship thing into something that was worse than the lazy and rather pointless keep management from the first game for me, and sailing around is boring since you\'ll end up seeing all the possible events literally within hours.\n\nSo I really wish they\'d gone with a more traditional setting... still could have been tropical or even islands I guess, but kept the story tied to a few important ones.

Most of what I'd say has been said but a key element that has drawn me in has been the companions. They banter with each other frequently and 25+ hours in are still doing so. They react to story elements. They like/dislike each other for supporting various causes. They respond to choices I make. It's a shame none of this really impacts gameplay, but it's a huge improvement over PoE1. Instead of reading 20 minute expositions, their personality gets doled out in even, more realistic chunks. They're not as well written as Bioware companions, but it's close as an RPG has gotten in a while.\n"", ""I personally love the game, and for me Deadfire exceeds the first game in many ways. \n\nThe combat system, for me at least, has improved tremendously and is far more enjoyable. Magic and most abilities are per encounter now as opposed to being per rest, making management far less tedious. Also, less trash mobs (making areas less of a slog to get through). Initially the difficulty was much, much easier than the first game but now encounters are a nice fit between a challenge without being too frustrating (difficulty in the first was...not for everyone...myself included). \n\nThe multiclassing system is deep, planning characters and theorycrafting can be a lot of fun in itself. You're also given more options when it comes to building party members. \n\nParty members (that is, the ones you don't make yourself) are a mixed bag. The first game admittedly has the more interesting cast, with Deadfire's new companions a hit or miss. The returning companions are handled very well though. There are also sidekicks, or party members that aren't treated as full companions but do have their own unique voice and character. You might be a little disappointed since they're actually pretty cool and leave much to be desired (a.k.a, the 'what would be if they WERE full companions').\n\nThe sailing is fun (sea shanties!), as are the bounty quests. Dungeons aren't as long and more sparse than the first, take that what you will. \n\nThe setting is a nice departure from the typical crpg fantasy. I loved the pirates and island theme. \n\nPlenty of factions and ways to handle quests which are a very good thing. The roleplaying part is very much in Deadfire. \n\nMy gripes are the incredibly short main quest, bad ship combat and crew events are repetitive (and trigger way too often for my liking).

[LONG]\n\nIt\'s a CRPG like Baldurs Gate or Pillars of Eternity.  \nThe question i\'ve been asked about it is how it compares to Pillars of Eternity (PoE).\n\nPoE has a MUCH stronger lore, worldbuilding, and backstory. It is swimming in so much lore you could just read for days to comprehend the world and everything in it. Some people love this, I like it a little, but it was way too much for me. when a new bit of lore would come I would have to try and remember how it tied to one of a thousand threads of story. much was optional but in PoE it felt like if you didn\'t pay attention to the lore why were you even playing the game? It would be like reading a book for the pictures. the Lore is the selling point of the game and it\'s extensive and well done.\n  \nTyranny by comparison doesn\'t feel like that, there is of course lore, backstory, and worldbuilding but it isn\'t so gigantic or feel as important as it is in PoE. It felt right and as someone with ADHD it kept me interested in the plot and backstory the whole way through. \n\nGameplay I enjoyed, its real-time-turn-based as in it\'s real time, but you\'re probably going to be pausing frequently to issue new commands. I played as a spell-caster and REALLY enjoyed the spell system. Honestly that spell system was a lot of fun, you would find different modifiers and use these modifiers to create a specific spell. For example you could have a fireball, or you could change the focus so that now it\'s a Beam of fire, or maybe its a self-target and now it\'s a fire shield that damages attackers, or maybe now it\'s a buff that gives you fire resistance. \n\nMelee isn\'t nearly as interesting as the Spellcasting, It\'s a few slotted abilities as you would expect from any RPG. I would suggest that if you do go with Melee and find the combat boring to check out Spellcasting.\n\nThe game plot is one of the first games where ""Multiple Endings"" doesn\'t feel like ""Your last decision was the only one that counts""\n\nThere truly are decisions that you make that change the world, the story, allies, enemies, factions. For an example: One of the first major decisions that you make you might think that you have two options to choose between, which faction to side with. After beating the game I went online and found that there were significantly more options than were obvious. If i recall what appeared to be two options, ended up actually being five potential paths that dramatically change how the rest of the game is played.\n\nAll in all i was really impressed with this game, I recommend it to anyone who likes CRPG\'s and a morality system that isn\'t ""Good vs bad"" but explores so many different shades that you\'ll question if the choices you made were actually for the best.\n\n[edit]\n\nRegarding the DLC:\n\n- Tales from the Tiers: Questionable amount of content, the sale price of $3.14 seems about right. It definitely didn\'t feel like it was worth the original $7.\n- Portrait Pack: $1.79 for some optional character portrait\'s. I have no recommendations as it\'s just vanity.\n- Bastards Wound: I haven\'t come back to replay the game with this DLC, I heard mixed things about it. I heard it was pretty buggy.

rpg_gamers,t3_91yae8,"Looking for RPGs with interesting classes/jobs/professions that allow for customization.So I broke my leg (Snapped my tibia like a dry noodle while when I fell off a fucking sidewalk) recently and have have been going stir-crazy in my room. I was wondering if you guys could help me find some great RPGs to pass the time indoors while I recover. I just sunk 60+ hours into Octopath Traveler as it hit the sweet spot of interesting story, cool classes, and just barely enough customization to make me spend hours min/maxing jobs, equipment and passive skills. 

I was wondering if anybody could recommend any good RPGs that have similar classes/jobs/professions that allow for customization, especially multiclassing or subclassing.

# Some recent examples of stuff I loved:

* Octopath Traveler (Love the advanced classes)
* Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire (Best implementation of multiclassing ever)
* Divinity Original Sin 1 + 2 
* Tyranny (Not exactly multi-classing, but you basically get freedom of choice in builds).
* Valkyria Chronicles (I just like the class system)
* Dragon's Dogma
* Dragon Age: Origins (The specializations were dope AF).

# What I'm not looking for:

* Witcher 3 (Game world, story, lore were all amazing. Combat was kinda shit, felt very floaty, loot was garbage, you just chose Light/Medium/Heavy Witcher gear and stuck with it till you could upgrade, abilities were boring except for Blood and Wine expansion. Still played for 300 hours, but not what I'm looking for right now).
* Dragon Age 2-3 
* Mass Effect Games (Too few active abilities, no real meaningful class progression, no multiclassing)
* Bethesda RPGs
* Looters like Diablo III / Grim Dawn
* Shadowrun (Could never get into the games, I love mages, and the Mages/Shamans in these games felt soooo         unimpactful, a damn minigun with autoreload is 100x  better that magic).
* Rougelikes

I have every current gen console, handheld (even PS VITA) and an awesome PC so I'm up for whatever you guys recommend. I love all forms of RPGs including turn-based, tactical, CRPGs, first-person, action/adventure, and whatever else you can think of.

rpg_gamers,t3_91s3m1,"Looking for a cRPG with two main characteristicsHey all. I'm looking to break into some of the types of RPGs I haven't messed with much.  EDIT: For clarification I haven't played anything, except a tiny bit of FO2. That's it.

However, I'm not really sure what to try.

Here's what I want:

1: **An interesting story that I can follow**. If I'm going to be playing a long time, I'd definitely like to be playing to some kind of interesting story, one that I can wrap my head around and not just get unnecessarily confused. Some games or stories might crawl a little too far up their lore, in-universe rules and jargon, thus ending up with something pretty convoluted. If I can't understand what's going on, I can't get invested. And I don't want to *not play the game* and take 10 hours to re-read through summaries to figure out what's actually happening. Storytelling is important. 

2: **Streamlined Mechanics/UI/Combat, at least a bit.** I don't want playing the game itself to feel like a total slog. It's nice to some people to have options and lots of fine controls, but I don't want to be overwhelmed by it or be spending 4 hours just emptying one piece of inventory. It can be fun to do that sort of thing too, but it's not what I'm looking for at the moment. 

Other things are always nice to have. Characters don't need to be fantastic, as long as they're not completely bland and forgettable, at least for the important ones. I'm not picky on graphics. Game can be new or old, I don't mind.

Thanks for any suggestions!

rpg_gamers,t3_91rvga,"Thoughts On RPG Battle Mechanics Redundancy: Intensity vs ExpressionWhen I first came up with the idea for my hardcore tactical RPG loot game over 8 years ago, my goal was to take every cool core feature from every RPG I loved and cram it into a super awesome battle system. In addition to the 20,000+ hours I’ve spent playing RPG’s I also have now spent thousands of hours dissecting them. Reading through all Dungeons and Dragons Books, pouring over skills and perks in dozens of RPG’s like Pillars of Eternity, Diablo, and even looking deep into card games that have cool unique effects like Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering. And of course diving deep into tactical RPG’s like Final Fantasy Tactics and the Disgaea series.

It wasn’t until I started to design my own RPG I realized how shallow RPG battle mechanics can be and how hard it is to come up with unique new gameplay elements. These are my personal thoughts I’ve had over the years as I’ve been developing my game and I welcome your input and potentially differing viewpoint, so feel free to comment and express how you feel.

The problem, as I see it, with variety in an RPG has to do with the ultimate end goal of most battles. There are enemies, you need to kill them. So because you need to kill the enemies there is generally a high priority approach: deal as much damage as possible. And there’s the  rub, dealing the most damage as possible can be a lot less interesting than I expected.

When your goal is to kill the enemy, your objective becomes dealing as much damage as possible. Sure there might be nuances (like timing your attack so he doesn’t counter or something), but the general principal is you want to maximize damage output (you also want to minimize damage taken but that doesn’t ultimately win you the battle, to win you need to kill). And because you want to maximize output a lot of “interesting” mechanics can be rendered obsolete because they don’t deal optimal damage. For example, say an enemy is weak to fire, the choice to use fire becomes the obvious and critical choice. This also makes the decision to use a fire attack simple and while there might be other options available, they really aren’t viable options. As a result I find many RPG battles tend lack the depth and decision making because the most damaging choice is almost always the obvious and required one. For the sake of argument I am not going to deal with dexterity and timing mechanics (like Dark Souls for example) as I am more interested in the tactics layer (and movement in games like Dark Souls adds a different layer of gameplay that can make otherwise redundant moves no longer redundant).

You might be thinking that different enemies have different damage type weaknesses gives the game variety --- and it does, but it’s very shallow variety in my opinion. If an enemy is weak to a damage type, then you will just use that damage type. You aren’t causing the player to think or solve a problem differently, you are merely telling the player that to do max damage to this enemy, use a skill that does X damage type. And this is because you are making the player worry about **intensity** instead of **expression**.

As I’ve come to understand it, there really are 2 ways mechanics manifest in a game. There is the Intensity of the action, and the Expression of an action. Intensity is exactly that, how intense the actual action your taking is. If you are damaging an enemy, intensity is how much damage you are doing. If you are healing, intensity is how much you are healing. Intensity can be fun and entertaining, but it can also be shallow and uninteresting without expression. Expression is the actual way an action manifests in a game. This can be different on a per game basis, but the core idea is that Expression is how the actual action occurs and what it affects. 

For example, in Zelda: Breathe of the Wild, you can freeze objects in time. Freezing an object in time is an expression mechanic. You can also hit objects with a weapon and this does damage. How the weapon swings (on a per weapon basis) is an expression, and how much damage is does is intensity. But one of the things that makes Breathe of the Wild so great is the variety of its expression because of its emergent expressive mechanics. For example, if you freeze a boulder in time and then hit it a number of times with a weapon, you charge it with energy and when it unfreezes the energy you build up releases and it launch’s the boulder. This is combination of mechanics represents layered expression which I think is the pinnacle of game design. This allows the designers to create interesting problems for the player to solve that don’t just rely on doing the most damage. The more interesting and combinatorial ways you can create expression mechanics in a game, the better and more interesting it will be to the player. The breadth and depth of these mechanics is a topic for another discussion.

I think many RPG’s rely too heavily on intensity and lack a lot of expression when it comes to their battle mechanics. That’s not to say any particular game is bad (as there are many factors which make a game great like Story, art, and sound), but when speaking strictly about battle mechanics, I think many RPG games come up short.

Let’s take a look at the common stats in an RPG and remove the redundancy as it pertains to creating an RPG based battle system focused only on unique expression:

**Strength:** Physical Damage

**Dexterity:** Accuracy 

**Intelligence:** Magic Damage

**Charisma:** Personality

**Endurance:** Health/Defense

These are the general stats a typical RPG has and at first glance it might seem like there’s a lot of build variation and customization. But after spending many hours trying to create interesting game mechanics around these stats I’ve found how limited this core set of stats can be.

Let’s take a look at Strength vs Intelligence. They are really the same stat: damage intensity. If you are a Wizard you will generally max intelligence and if you are a Fighter you will maximize your Strength. It’s not that interesting having both of these stats because it’s really just the same stat. Pillars of Eternity did something interesting with this stat when they used “Might” to represent all damage, and I personally liked that approach. In terms of redundancy, these two stats can be merged into one. For the sake of argument I will call this damage in the reduced list.

Dexterity is one of my most hated stats (as both a player and designer). Personally, I don’t like miss or chance mechanics in an RPG. All accuracy does is (sporadically) curb your damage over time. So really it’s just a random throttle on your damage, so it’s a redundant intensity stat too. Yes, you could have some equipment restricted to requiring this stat, but restricting gameplay based on stats promotes less variety not more. As it pertains to redundancy, this stat can be removed all together.

Charisma for me has never been a fun stat to focus on. Most RPG’s prioritize battle skills over social problem solving. This is too bad because this is one of the few more unique stats that can allow for interesting solutions. However, many games have “roll for success” when it comes to charisma mechanics and far too often it’s an exercise in save scumming tolerance. Because charisma often boils down to non-battle based mechanics and I want to look strictly at battle mechanics, I will remove this stat.

Endurance is how much damage you can take before you die. An important stat, but people generally want to play offensively not defensively. However this is unique and important.

Revisiting this list and stripping it down to its purest form we’re left with:

**Damage:** How much damage your attacks do

**Endurance:** How much damage you can take before dying

Yup. That’s really what any game boils down to. This makes me all the more amazed at how varied and diverse some RPG’s can be. But it also makes me realize how important expression is. Expression is what makes dealing (and avoiding) damage interesting. Expression is how you let the player invent solutions by layering mechanics together. Expression is how you get variety and increase engagement. Expression is what makes a game worth exploring and mastering. 

Games like Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering are not RPG’s but they do have interesting “battle mechanics”. I find the expression of a card game like these can be more interesting than your standard JRPG battle and I’ve always wanted to blend the mechanics of a card game battle with that of RPG with a party system. In fact my game, Grrbls, draws direct inspiration from these card mechanics because I loved how each deck and game can play out differently, even with the same cards. I wanted to get this variety working with tactical RPG style battles and I continue even now to hone and refine my battle system to maximize its expressiveness.

These are my thoughts on intensity and expression, but I’d love to hear your thoughts as either a gamer or a developer. What do you think are the core pillars of an RPG battle system. What are mechanics you’ve loved or hate? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/91rvga/thoughts_on_rpg_battle_mechanics_redundancy/,"[""Hmm, very interesting write up. I'm a game dev and I'm currently building my own battle system (cribbed from D&amp;D 5e and JRPGs), and I'm running into the same issues. Ideally, you want to give players a wide range of options in combat, but naturally, only a few paths will be optimized. \n\nYou're mostly right in that combat can be boiled down to dealing out the most damage while avoiding or soaking up as much as possible. This is because, as opposed to real life or even tabletop games, video games tend to be hard-coded to either you or your enemies dying/falling over. Once you introduce non-damage-related win conditions, everything changes. Can certain enemies be negotiated with? Can they be charmed or forced to flee? Can they be defeated through other, perhaps environmental means?\n\nThere's a lot that RPG battle systems haven't explored yet.\n"", 'I stand by Sid Meier\'s idea that a good game is a sequence of interesting choices the player makes. So the battle system in a turn-based game should be optimized in a way to provide interesting choices every turn. If the gameplay can be reduced to ""use the same action, or the same rotation of actions all the time"", it\'s obviously flawed. The best games, I find, are the ones like X-Com, or Into the Breach, or Divinity: Original Sin, where every turn, basically, provides you with a puzzle. You must optimize the actions of your party members so that the enemies suffer most damage, and your characters survive, and maybe lay down foundations for the next turn via buffing or summoning.\n\nThe same can be said about card-based games. The mode I enjoyed the most in recent MTG computer games was the Puzzle mode, where you were presented with a prepared situation and needed to ""solve"" it, be defeating the opponent in 1 (or sometimes 2 or 3) turns.\n\nThe key feature here is that the most optimal solution must not be obvious, or the game turns into automated repetition. This means that the possible states of the battlefield must be varied enough, and the set of tools available to the player must also be varied enough to face the challenges.\n\nI struggle to suggest a way to design systems that lead to such outcome, but I think the key is having varied status effects, including area effects in games with tactical map. Better yet if those status effects can interact in interesting ways (D:OS is a perfect example of this approach). It also helps to have abilities that are clearly different, clearly useful, and do not duplicate each other functionality (which means, for example, that the damage should scale with character\'s attributes, so that we only need one ""Deal X damage"" ability instead of 3-5 of them with different damage amounts).\n\nAs for the specific mechanics, I\'m particularly fond of ""counters"" from MTG, which are just additional variables kept with a character that change upon some trigger and can cause attribute changes and other actions when reaching certain thresholds. The basic example of a counter is an enemy which gets stronger every time you hit it, forcing you to try to kill it with the minimal number of attacks, or a count-down on bomb-enemy before it explodes, dealing heavy area damage, but many other interesting interactions are possible with counters. The only problem is that it\'s hard for player to keep track of them in a complex 3D game - unlike abstract, schematic representation of the battlefield in MTG. So you have to limit the number of counters you use to just a few.\n\nSome recent games provide us with a great opportunity to use how card-based combat system can be made. \n\n[Trulon: The Shadow Engine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/433840/Trulon_The_Shadow_Engine/) is a good example of how NOT to do it: the game lacks variety in its cards, and the battles might as well be fought on automatic. On the other hand, [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) and [Card Quest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/493080/Card_Quest/) provide good examples. StS, especially, has a very well-tuned combat system that allows many interesting situations, and forces the player to think, especially during the boss battles and battles with the later enemies. Card Quest has interesting things going on in terms of using additional per-class-specialization counters. Finally, an older F2P title [Card Hunter](https://store.steampowered.com/app/293260/Card_Hunter/) provides a great example of integration between tactical RPG gameplay and card-based systems - despite its F2P status, I heartily recommend this game, as it can be enjoyed for free in single-player, and much can be learned from it.', ""I believe the most important thing for a interesting battle system is a varied amount of mechanics that can be utilized to capitalize on a monster's weakness. I've been playing a lot of gungeon lately and the most addicting part is learning all the methods to deal and survive monsters.""]"

That I can remember, the connections are the Silver Sword of Gith and the companion Bishop who makes a brief but pretty interesting appearance (Bishop's interaction also lets you pick dialog options that dictate what happened to some/all of the other companions from the OC). The basic plot line from the OC is also mentioned but not really important.\n\nYou start MotB at something like level 17, and get a chance to build your character from scratch, so if you like D&amp;D 3.5ish character building its a quick and easy way to play a high level character.

rpg_gamers,t3_90sqko,What Beamdog enhanced edition to start out with?Fellow gamers! I’m pretty new to cRPGs (although 25 year in gaming -primarily wargaming and strategy) and just had immense fun playing POE; so now wondering which of the old classics you guys would recommend as the next step? Cheers from Denmark! ,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/90sqko/what_beamdog_enhanced_edition_to_start_out_with/,"[""Unpopular opinion: I actually like the new companions in the EE. I honestly didn't realize Neera wasn't an original character when I started off by playing BG2 until I read the wiki.\n\nIn any case, it sort of depends on what type of game you want. There is much less urgency in the plot of BG1, and a great part of the fun for me is running around the map just exploring; a much more refined Skyrim, if you will :P\n\nBG2 has more character interaction and is usually rated as being the better of the two. The main plot, while you can ignore it for much of the game, is more urgent, and also more fleshed out.\n\nI'd recommend starting off with BG1, just for the chronological order, and being able to export your character.\n\nThe next big question is whether to play Siege of Dragonspear. I'd say just play it; its an entertaining expansion in its own right, and more Baldurs gate is always welcome. On the other hand, others are of the opinion that it somehow detracts from the original. Without spoiling too much, I will concede that it does introduce new plot points that don't fit that well with BG2. Really up to you whether you want to play through it, or save it until after you play BG2.\n\nNow that you've finished BG, the next game depends on what you enjoyed. If you like reading and conversions, play Planescape torment. Its excellent.  If you enjoyed the infinity engine combat, play Icewind dale. Its focus is (apparently, I still have to play it!) less on the dialogues and more on the combat."", ""I'd say start with Baldur's Gate 1, although it's seen as fairly vanilla and it's low level stuff (you cap out somewhere around level 7-8 I believe).  I enjoyed it and felt it was a good intro to Infinity Engine games.\n\nIf you're after unique setting and heavy story emphasis with far less combat, Planescape: Torment fits that bill."", ""A common way of going through them is:\n\nPlanecape,\nBG,\nBG DragonSpear,\nBG2,\nIcewindale,\nNeverwinter\n\nThere has been some discussion about getting ee or not.\n\nThe EE each has 100's of bug fixes and include mods like ui and widescreen.\n\nThey are also updated to have compatibility with newer operating systems.\n\nMost mods have been updated for EE and in some cases improved.\n\nSome people have issues with the new npcs. The big difference is the stark contrast to the orginal npcs. If you dont like it you can kick them out.\n\nThe only reason to go non EE is for some of the niche mods and to act smug that your 'playing the orginal vision'."", 'None, play the originals.

rpg_gamers,t3_90m9eo,"AWOIAF RP -- A Community Driven Roleplay here on Reddit, based in the world of Game of Thrones!The greatest tourney of the age has ended. But the story has only begun.

The Lords and Ladies of the Seven Kingdoms have gathered at Summerhall to herald the end of winter. A palace of white marble and twisting spires, the ancient Targaryen seat now shelters the greatest nobles of the realm. The Starks, proud and noble, have sent representatives, and the Arryns -- marred by their rebellion ten years past -- have lingered on the outskirts. The Lannisters arrived with great pomp and circumstance, gilded and glorious in their trappings of steel and gold. The Tyrells, favoured by their ties to the queen, made sure to see their house words proven true. Even the Baratheons, stalwart and strong as ever, enjoyed the festivities of Summerhall alongside the enigmatic Martells.

But the early revelries of the Westerosi have been tarnished by tragedy. Four men lie dead -- one accidentally slain in a hunt by his own father, and another murdered by none other than the Sword of the Morning.

With winter steadily drawing nearer and the iron grip of Queen Visaera Targaryen firm upon the realm, the struggles of lords and knights and schemers must be subtle, clever, and most importantly -- cautious. All still remember the failed rebellion by the Prince of Summer and the Bastard of Dragonstone, where ten thousand Valemen burned alive at the Battle of the Ford and the Reach rallied her banners to fight on behalf of the Seven. Worse still, the followers of the Red God make steady progress, having already found traction in King’s Landing itself.

Across the sea, the exiled Aeryn Targaryen names himself the Prince of the Narrows, laying claim to the whole of the Stepstones. His dragon, Stormsong, makes the claim a dangerous one -- but the renewed Kingdom of the Three Daughters is not like to accept it meekly. Already merchants and magisters from across the Triarchy gather in Myr for the upcoming festival. What can come of it, none can say, but one thing is certain -- 

The Game continues.

###Frequently Asked Questions!

####1. Which houses are open?

There are many houses, great and small, open for players to app and customize! Some of the more popular ones include; **Mormont, Reed, Piper, Drumm, Goodbrother, Lannister of Lannisport, Marbrand, Serrett, the Fossoways, Oakheart, Dondarrion, Penrose, Tarth, Toland**, and **Qorgyle!**

These are popular houses that currently don't have players at all. But many others do! If a particular House interests you, there's a possibility you can take up a member -- just speak with the head of the house on Discord!

####2. How much influence do I have on history/events?

The short answer is -- **a lot!** AWOIAF RP is one of the few roleplaying subreddits that utilizes both rolls and periodic timeskips to ensure that you are not only able to influence the world around you, but build, develop, and eventually play members of your family! Time skips mean that plans and stories can span generations -- with the history of the present day forged by players and characters from yesteryear.

####3. I hear you have dragons?

We do indeed have player-claimable dragons. The application process for these are a lot different from regular apps, and are - obviously - limited based upon ability. If you're interested, act quickly! But don't fret if you don't have one. Most of the realm doesn't -- and the next skip may see your fortunes change!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/90m9eo/awoiaf_rp_a_community_driven_roleplay_here_on/,
